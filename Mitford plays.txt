               SCENE I.
               Scene—An Apartment in Whitehall.
               Enter Ireton, Harrison, and Pride, to Downes and
                           Marten.
                     
               
                  
                     Downes.
                  
                  Welcome to London,Ireton! dearly welcome
                  To fair Whitehall!
                     Harrison!
                     Pride!Where loiters
                  The valiant General?
               
               
                  Ireton.
                  He alighted with us
                  Three hours agone.
               
               
                  Marten.
                  What, three hours here, and still
                  In harness! Know ye not your coat of mail
                  Is out of date? Go, doff your armour quick,
                  Provide ye civil suits, grave civil suits,
                  Sad reverend civil suits.
               
               
                  Pride.
                  What mean'st thou?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Seek
                  Meaning of Harry Marten! Tush! Where
                     tarries
                  The piousCromwell?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  He is busied still
                  Disposing the tired soldiery.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Disbanding
                  Will be his business soon. The lubbard people,
                  And the smug citizens, are grown aweary
                  Of this rough war. Ye must learn gentler trades
                  If ye would thrive. Peace is the cry, my masters;
                   Peace and the King!
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The Newport treaty speeds;
                  So far is sure.
               
               
                  Harrison.
                  But we bring victory,
                  To the good cause. Cromwell hath passed careering
                  From hold to hold, sweeping as with a besom
                  
                  The foul malignants from the land. The
                        North
                  
                  Is ours from sea to sea.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  'Tis a brave leader;
                  But peace is ever the best victory.
               
               Enter Cromwel.
               
                  Mar.
                  In good time comes the General. Valiant Cromwell
                  
                  Thy praise was on our lips.
               
               
                  Cromwell.
                  Not mine! not mine!
                  Praise to the Lord of Hosts, whose mighty shield
                  Bucklered us in the battle, whose right arm
                  Strengthened us when we smote! Praise to the Lord!
                  For his poor instruments, the meanest soldier
                  Doth his great duty; we no more. My masters,
                  Have ye no news astir? News, the prime staple
                  Of yonder tattling city?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Aye; the worst
                  Is that the Commons grow from day to day
                  More doubtful of the army, more possessed
                  By canting presbyters.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Name not the Commons,
                  A jealous crew, whose envious hate descends
                  'Twixt every pause of fear on us their loathed
                  Despised defenders. Were there but one head
                  To the whole army, they would turn to truth
                  An elder tyrant's wish, and chop it off.
                  Despots who prate of liberty!—
               
               
                  Har.
                  Worse! worse!
                  A godless yet intolerent crew, who rear
                  O'er the down-fallen Church that blacker idol
                  A conscience-fettering Presbytery.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir,
                  They shall be quelled. Power, howsoever called,
                  Is still the subtlest snare the Tempter weaves
                  For man's frail sinful soul. Save me from power!
                  Grant me to follow still, a lowly soldier
                  In the great cause! The Commons shall be
                     quelled.
                  What other news?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The best is that the King
                  
                  And the Commissioners draw near a godly
                  And salutary peace. The King hath bent
                  His will in a wise humbleness; and now—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I joy to hear thee say so. What! the Lord
                  Hath turned his heart, and he hath yielded up
                  His haughtyprelates, his ill councillors,
                  The popish mummery of his chapel?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Nay,
                  Not yet; but he hath promised.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Promised! Oh
                  The King hath promised!
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Well?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  And ye believe?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Would'st have us doubters?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  In good sooth, not I!
                  Believe who can! yet ere ye set him free
                  Look to the stuffing of his saddle, search
                  The waste leaves of his prayer-book, lest ye find
                  Some vow to Henrietta, some shrewd
                     protest,
                  Some antedated scroll to throw the shadow
                  Of a plain lie before his words. Search! search!
                  It is a prudent King, that casts about him
                  To rid him of his enemies. Search, I say.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Why,Cromwell, thou art bitter.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Heaven forfend!
                  I liked Charles Stuart well. I am of the
                     fools
                  Whom Habit counts amidst her slaves; that love,
                  For old acquaintance sake, each long-known pest
                  And close familiar evil. I liked him well;
                  The better that his proud disgracious speech
                  Seemed to my plain and downright simpleness
                  As honest as mine own. Ye all remember
                  What friends we were at Holmby. Harrison
                  
                  And e'en my loving kinsman deemed I waxed
                  Faint in the cause. But rightly it is written
                  In the one Holy Book, Put not thy trust
                  In Princes.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Yet is he in 
                     Carisbooke
                  
                  A present danger. Round yon prison isle
                  
                  Lurk spies and plots and treasons. Every breeze
                  Comes pregnant with quick rumours; every ear
                  Is bent to listen; every eye is turned
                  On those grey walls.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I grant ye. But astir,
                  Free as the breeze to traverse sea and land,
                  Creep in our councils, sweep across our camps,
                  Were the King harmless then? Yet thou art right;
                  He's dangerous in Carisbrooke.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Dismiss him;
                  Send him abroad unkinged; or drive him forth
                  As Amaziah.
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  
                     (Aside)
                  Ha! And they slew him!
               
               
                  Mar.
                  What, send him to seek succour in each court,
                  From papal Rome to savage
                     Muscovy,
                  Till he shall burst on us in triumph, heading
                  
                     Europe's great armament.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Wert thou a soldier,
                  And in this cause, thou would'st cry Welcome, Marten,
                  To such an armament.
               
               
                  Har.
                  With His great help.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye, with His help and in this cause, if union
                  Dwelt in the land. But this is idle talk.
                  The King is dangerous; dangerous on the throne,
                  Dangerous in prison, dangerous abroad,
                  At home and everywhere. Yet this is idle.
                  We must abide the
                     Commons' treaty.
                  
               
               
                  Har.
                  Wherefore
                  Lifts not the army the strong hand of
                     power
                  Over these stiff-necked rulers? Put them down.
                  Tread out the firebrands.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Rather move the Commons
                  
                  To bring the King to trial.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Who said that?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  'Twas bravely spoken.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Who said that?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The words
                  Sounded like treason.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir, had we met here
                  To compass such intent, the very thought
                  Had been a treason. But the words fell straight
                  Midst our unconscious hearts, unprompted, quick,
                  Startling even him who spake them—-like the fire
                  That it the Burning Bush. A sign from Heaven!
                  Direct from Heaven! A comfortable light
                  To our benighted spirits! As I wrestled
                  
                     In prayer this morning, when I would have cried
                  For mercy on Charles Stuart, my parched
                     tongue
                  Clave to my mouth. A token from on high!
                  A star lit up to guide us!
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Yet the Commons
                  
                  Will scarcely echo this rapt strain. The King
                  
                  Hath friends amongst us.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Fear not. He who sent
                  This impulse on his servants will know how
                  To turn all hearts.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Ye will not slay the King?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Life hangs not on our lips. Yet surely, Sir,
                  I hope to spare him. Friends, we must not sleep
                  Over such stirring business. Downes, go
                     thou
                  For Bradshaw, that resolved and learned and wise
                  And godly law-man. Thou art like to find him
                  At the Guildhall. Say we would speak
                     with him.
                  (Exit Downes.)
                  
                     Harrison!—Downes went
                     forth as one who loves not
                  His errand—Lacks he zeal? 'Tis a brave soldier,
                  And yet—Follow him, Marten; and return
                  With Bradshaw hither. We shall need
                     thy counsel.
                  Delay not.—
                   (Exit Marten.)
                  
                     Harrison! thou truest soldier
                  Of the good cause, to thee we trust the charge
                  Of guarding our great prisoner. Make thee ready
                  For a swift journey. I'll confer with thee
                  Alone afore thou goest.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Should I not see
                  The General?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Wherefore? Hence.
                  (Exit Harrison.)
                  
                     (To Pride)
                  Nay, Colonel, go not!
                  I'd speak with thee, good Colonel. Rest thee, son,
                  I'd speak with this good Colonel.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  I attend
                  Your Excellency's pleasure.
               
               (During the next few speeches Cromwell walks up and down the stage, now speaking to himself, now looking at the weather, now asking questions, without attending to the answers, evidently absorbed in thought.)
               
                  Crom.
                  
                  Aye, the light
                  Mercurial Harry Marten said but sooth;
                  They are unripe for this great charge. It shall be—
                  And yet—What is the hour?
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Upon the stroke
                  Of one.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  He listens not. Look how he searches
                  The weather with unseeing eyes.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Tis stormy.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Nay a bright day.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  He hears not.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sweep them off,
                  And the whole game is ours! But—Which way blows
                  The wind?
               
               
                  Pride.
                  Right from the south.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  It must be, shall be.
                  
                     Ireton, I gave thee yesterday a scroll
                  Of the malignants in the Commons>—Hark ye!
                  The Commons, our great masters! If Charles
                        Stuart
                  
                  Have friends in England, he will find them there
                  'Mid those self-seekers.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Wherefore not arraign
                  The King before the Council?.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  
                     Sir, we need
                  The Commons' name. I would not that our just
                  And righteous cause lacked any form of law
                  To startle tender consciences. I have thought
                  Afore of this. Didst never see the thrasher
                  Winnow the chaff from the full grain? Good Colonel,
                  Thyself shalt play the husbandman to cleanse
                  This sample of foul corn. Take yonder scroll,
                  And with a troop of horse, go post thyself
                  Beside the Commons' door, and seize each man
                  Whose name stains that white parchment. Treat all well,
                  But let none enter.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  And my warrant?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir,
                  My word. If any question, say the General—
               
               
                  Pri.
                  
                     Lord Fairfax?
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye, the good Lord General
                  Shall hear of thy good service. Fear it not.
                  Myself shall tell him. Thy good service, dearer
                  Than half a dozen battles; better worth
                  And richlier guerdoned. Haste! Lord Grey of
                        Groby
                  
                  Will aid thee to detect the knaves. Away!
                  Full many a goodly manor shall change masters
                  To-morrow 'fore the sequestrators.
               
               (Exit Pride.)
               
                  Ire.
                  So!
                  That work will be well done.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I loathe myself
                  That I employ the mercenary tool;
                  But we are in our great aims justified,
                  Our high and holy purpose. Saints and prophets
                  Have used uncleanly instruments. Good son,
                  Keep between Fairfaxand these men. The weak
                  
                     Wife-ridden faintling would demur and dally,
                  
                     And pause at every step, and then draw back,
                  Unapt for good or ill. He must know nought.
                  Re-enter Harrison and Pride.
                  
                  What make ye here again?
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Dost thou not hear?
                  A mutiny amongst the soldiers.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Nay,
                  But half a score malignants, who would fain
                  Stir up the soldiery.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  And they?
               
               
                  Har.
                  They listen,
                  But move not.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Seize the traitors. Shoot them dead;
                  If any murmur, still them too. Let death
                  Follow offence as closely as the sound
                  Of the harquebuss the flash. Art thou not gone?
                  What stops thee?
               
               
                  Har.
                  Be more merciful.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Why this
                  Is mercy. If thou saw'st one, match in hand
                  Approach a mine hollowed beneath some rich
                  And populous town, would'st strike him down at once,
                  Or wait till he had fired the train.
               
               
                  Har.
                  At once!
                  At once!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Well?—Go thou too, fair son! away!
                  I'll follow on the instant. Look I find
                  The guilty quiet.
                  Exeunt HarrisonandIreton.
                  
                  We have been too easy
                  And fostered malcontents. Yet this swift vengeance
                  
                     Will strike a wholesome terror, and the echo
                  May reach to higher miscreants. Good Colonel,
                  Thou loiterest overlong. Go, block the door
                  And let none pass. Be sure thou let none pass.
                  I must to yon poor traitors. Let none pass.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               —An Apartment in Carisbrooke
                        Castle.
               The KingandHerbert
               
               
                  King.
                  Herbert!
               
               
                  Herbert.
                  My liege.
               
               
                  King.
                  Put up my book. I wait
                  The grave Commissioners, and to be seen
                  
                     Poring o'er Shakespeare's page—Oh heinous sin!
                  Inexpiable deadly sin!
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Your Grace
                  Speaks cheerily.
               
               
                  King.
                  Why I have fed my thoughts
                  On the sweet woodland tale, the lovely tale
                  Of 
                        
                           Ardenne
                           Arden
                        
                        Forest, till the peaceful end,
                  The gentle comfortable end, hath
                     bathed
                  My very heart in sunshine. We are here
                  Banished as the old Duke, and friends come round,
                  And foes relent, and calm Forgiveness hangs,
                  An Angel, in the air, to drop her balm
                  On all our wounds. I thank thee, royal spirit,
                  Thrice princely poet, from whose lightest scene
                  Kings may draw comfort. Take yon sprig of bay
                  And lay between the leaves. I marvel much
                  Where loiter the Commissioners.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Your Grace
                  Hath vanquished them so often that they creep
                  Fearfully to the field—a beaten foe.
               
               
                  King.
                  
                     Nay, we are near agreed. I have granted more
                  Than they durst think for. They set forth to day
                  Bearing my answer to the Commons. Look
                  To see a sudden peace. Many will deem
                  I have yielded overmuch; but I keep quick
                  The roots of kingly power, albeit the boughs
                  Be shrewdly lopt. And then to see again
                  My wife, my children, to reward my poor
                  And faithful servants, to walk free, to reign!
                  Look to see sudden peace.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  
                  Yet, Sire—forgive my fear!—would thou hadst ta'en
                  The proffered means of safety, had escaped
                  This Island prison!
               
               
                  King.
                  What! when I had pledged
                  My word, my royal word! Fie! fie! good Herbert;
                  Better, if danger were, a thousand fold
                  Perish even here than forfeit that great bond
                  Of honour, a King's word. Fie! fie! Yet sooth
                  Thou mean'st me kindly, Herbert. Ha, the Sea,
                  That day and night hath chased so angrily,
                  Breaking around us with so wild a coil,
                  An elemental warder, smiles again,
                  Merrily dancing in the cold keen light
                  Of the bright wintery Sun. We shall have boats
                  From England.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  One hath landed, Sire.
               
               
                  King.
                  And they
                  May bear my message without pause. Who comes?

                  Ham
                  May't please you, Sire, the high Commissioners

                  Admit them.
                  
                     Enter Lord Salisbury, Lord Say, Sir Harry
                        Vane, and other Commissioners,
                     some of them Ministers.
                  
                  See, Vane hath lost his
                           frown! We shall have peace.
                  
                  Good morrow my good Lord of Salisbury!
                  Lord Say, Sir Harry Vane, and gentles all,
                  A fair good morrow. The sun smiles at last
                  Upon our meeting.
               
               
                  Say.
                  Sunshine after storm;
                  A happy omen, Sire, a type of peace.
               
               
                  Salis.
                  Yet clouds are gathering.
               
               
                  Say.
                  Tush! the noon-day sun
                  Will overcome them.
               
               
               
               
                  Vane.
                  Cease this heathenish talk
                  Of omens. Hath your grace prepared your answer
                  To the proposals of the Commons?
               
               
                  King.
                  Reach
                  Yon paper Herbert.
                     Set ye forth to-day?
               
               
                  Vane.
                  With the next tide.
               
               
                  King.
                  So speed ye wind and wave,
                  And send ye swiftly hence, and swiftlier back
                  Blest messengers of peace, winged like the dove 
                  That bore the olive token. Take my answer,
                  A frank compliance with each article
                  Save twain, save only twain.
               
               
                  Say.
                  And they—I pray thee
                  Be wholly gracious, Sire! Peril not thus
                  Your country's weal, your freedom, and your crown,
                  By timeless reservation.
               
               
                  King.
                  I have yielded
                  Power and prerogative, and state and wealth
                  For my dear country. All that was mine own
                  All that was mine to give, I freely gave;
                  That I withhold is of the conscience. Look
                  
                     On these white hairs, and think if one so signed
                  Marked for the grave, may for the vain respect
                  Of crowns or kingdoms offer up his friends
                  Or his old worship. Mark me: I'll not yield
                  A man of that devoted seven, nor bate
                  A word of my accustomed prayer, to save
                  My lips from cankering fetters, or win back
                  That velvet prison, a throne. No more of this.
                  Bear ye the treaty, Sirs; and use but half
                  That goodly gift of eloquence for me
                  That ye to me have shown, and be but heard
                  With half the grace, and we shall meet full soon& we shall meet full soon,
                  Subject and King, in peace, in blessed peace.—
                  
                     Harrison heard without.
                  Whoso asks entrance with so wild a din?
                  Give him admittance quickly.
               
               
                  Vane.
                  Yet, my liege,
                  For these seven cavaliers—
               
               
                  King.
                  No more! No more!
                  Thou hast my answer.—By the iron tread
                  A soldier.
               
               Enter Harrison.
               
                  Salis.
                  
                     Harrison! What brings
                     thee hither?
               
               
                  Har.
                  A sad and solemn message to your prisoner.
               
               
                  King.
                  Speak out thy tidings. Speak thine errand, Sir.
                  I am strong-hearted. Sovran privilege
                  Of them that tower so high!—Strong as yon eagle
                  That nests among the cliffs. I have borne loads
                  That would have sunk a meaner man in gulphs
                  Of deep despair. Thine errand. Stop! Who sent thee?
               
               
                  Har.
                  The Commons
               
               
                  King.
                  Now thine errand.
               
               
                  Har.
                  To demand
                  
                     The body of Charles Stuart,
                     sometime King
                  Of England—
               
               
                  King.
                  Sometime King?
               
               
                  Har.
                  Whom I attach
                  Of treason.
               
               
                  King.
                  Treason and the King! Off, Sir!
                  I warn thee touch me not. Some natures feel
                  A shuddering loathing of cold-blooded worms,
                  Snakes, aspics, vipers, toads—my flesh doth creep
                  And shiver if the reptile man approach
                  Too closely. Show thy warrant.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Look you, Sir,
                  The warrant be obeyed.
               
               
                  Vane.
                  Dost thou not see 
                  (to Salisbury)
                  The master hand of Cromwell in this deed? 
                  (to Harrison)
                  Where is the General?
               
               
                  Har.
                  Come victorious home—
                  Know'st thou not that?—to lend his pious aid
                  To our great work.
               
               
                  Salis.
                  But thou art from the Commons, 
                  Not from the Council,—sure thou saidst the Commons?
                  And they were earnest for the treaty.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Aye,
                  But in that goodly field grew tares, rank tares,
                  Which have been weeded out: stiffpresbyters,
                  Bitter malignants, and those sons of wrath
                  Who falter in the better path— dead boughs
                  Upon a noble tree. Some fifty horse
                  Swept off the rubbish.
               
               
                  Say.
                  But the men are safe? 
               
               
                  Har.
                  Even as thyself.
               
               (to the King)
               
                  Now, sir, hast thou enough
                  Studied yon parchment?
               
               
                  King.
                  Treason! to arraign
                  A crowned King of treason! I am here
                  
                     Treating with these same Commons on the faith, 
                  The general faith of nations. I appeal
                  To ye, my foes; to thee, my gaoler. What!
                  Stand ye all mute? high lords and learned lawmen,
                  And reverend ministers? Ye had glib tongues
                  For subtle argument, and treasonous craft,
                  And cobweb sophistry. Have ye no word
                  For faith, for honour? not one word? Shame! shame!
               
               
                  Vane.
                  We are the Commons'
                     servants, and must needs
                  Obey their mandates.
               
               
                  Say.
                  Yet with grief of heart—
               
               
                  Har.
                  Silence!
               
               
                  King.
                  Aye, silence! Sir, I thank thee yet
                  That sparest me that sharpest injury
                  A traitor's pity. For that gentle deed
                  I yield me gently to thy hands. Lead on
                  Where'er thou wilt; I follow.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Straight to London. 
                  To bide thy trial.
               
               
                  King.
                  What! will they dare that?
                  Doth not the very thought, the very word
                  Appal the rebels? Trial! When we meet
                  Confronted in that regal Hall, the King
                  And his revolted subjects, whoso then
                  Shall be the Judge? The King. Whoso make inquest,
                  Whoso condemn, and whoso fling a pardon,
                  A scornful pardon on your heads? The King,
                  The King, I tell ye, Sirs. Come on! I pant
                  To meet these Judges. For ye, solemn mockers, 
                  Grave men of peace, deceivers or deceived,
                  Sincere or false boots little, fare ye well! 
                  Yet give me yon vain treaty—Now, by Heaven
                  I shame to have communed with ye!—This slight paper,
                  That shivers at a touch, is tough and firm
                  Mated with such as ye. Bear to the Commons,
                  Your masters, yon torn fragments, fitting type 
                  Of their divided factions!—fitting type
                  Of ye, men of a broken faith! Farewell!
                  I wait thy pleasure, Sir.
               
               END OF THE FIRST ACT.
               
            
         
         
            ACT II.
            
               SCENE I.
               Scene—The Painted Chamber. A table at which
                     are seated Commissioners, Lawyers, &c.;  A gothic window behind the table, through which objects that pass may be seen.
               
                  Bradshaw, Fairfax, Ireton, Downes, Cook,
                     Marten, Tichburn, &c. Fairfax comes forward, followed by
                           Bradshaw, Ireton,
                        and Downes.
               
                  Fairfax.
                  Soon as the day be fixed, apprize me, Sirs;
                  The halberdiers shall wait ye.
               
               
                  Bradshaw.
                  Good my lord
                  Thou wilt not leave us? When did Fairfax
                     fly
                  A post of danger? And his honoured name
                  Stands foremost in our roll.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Sir, I am sworn
                  The soldier of the Commons, and as soldier
                  Obey them loyally. All that ye need
                  For state or for defence in this sad pageant
                  Our camp shall furnish. Save their General,
                  You may command the army. For this trial
                  I like it not. I am no gownsman. Sirs,
                  The halberdiers shall wait ye.
               
               (Exit Fairfax.)
               
                  Mar.
                  
                     What a nice
                  And peevish conscience Fairfax bears! Will
                     send
                  Arms, horses, men, to escort the prisoner, line
                  The Court, defend the judges, guard the scaffold—
                  If so our wisdom wills—yet hold himself
                  Content and harmless, so his single voice
                  Swell not the general doom.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Yet 'tis a wise
                  And noble gentleman.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Tush! a good sword-blade,
                  Keen in the field, but at the council dull
                  And heavy as the scabbard.
                  Enter Cromwell.
                  Lo! where comes
                  One whose bright spirit knows no dimness. Cromwell!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Hear ye the news my masters? Harrison,
                  That bold and zealous soldier of our Israel,
                  Is here.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Where is the King?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The King of Kings
                  
                  Delivers him unto us. Harrison
                  
                  Awaits his landing. We must be prepared
                  For instant trial. Glad am I and proud
                  To greet with looks so firm and resolute
                  This full and frequent council.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Yet you met
                  A great one who forsakes us.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The Lord General?
                  Why on the battle-day such loss might cause
                  An hour's perplexity. Now—Hark ye Sirs!
                  Passing awhile Lord Fairfax's door I saw
                  The Queen.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  
                     In England! Didst thou see her face?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No. But I knew her by the wanton curls,
                  The mincing delicate step of pride, the gait
                  Erect and lofty. 'Twas herself, I say,
                  Vain Jezabel
                     !
               
               
                  Dow.
                  At Fairfax's gate! Alas!
                  Poor lady!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (Aside)
                  Ha! And must we watch thee too?
                  
                  No word of this good Sirs.
                  (going to the table)
                  Why master Cook
                  
                  What needs this long indictment? Seems to me
                  Thou dost mistake our cause. The crime is not
                  A trivial larceny, where some poor thief
                  Is fenced and hemmed in by a form of words
                  In tedious repetition, endless links
                  Of the strong chain of law, lest at some loophole
                  The paltry wretch escape. We try a King,
                  In the stern name of Justice. Fling aside
                  These cumbering subtleties, this maze of words,
                  And in brief homely phrase, such as the soldier
                  May con over his watchfire, or the milk-maid
                  Wonderingly murmur as she tends her kine,
                  Or the young boy trace in his first huge scroll,
                  Or younger girl sew in her sampler, say
                  That we arraign Charles Stuart King of England
                  For warring on his people. Let this deed
                  Be clear and open as beseems the men
                  On whom the Lord hath set his seal. Besides
                  That will let loose thy stream of eloquence
                  Ice-bound by this cold freezing plea. What says
                  
                     Our learned President?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  
                     Thou art right. Thou art right.
                  Our fair intent needs not a veil. Be sure
                  He shall have noble trial and speedy, such
                  As may beseem a King.

                  What is his bearing?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Resolved and confident. Lately at Windsor
                  
                  
                     Eating a Spanish melon of choice flavour,
                  He bade his servant Herbert send the seeds
                  To be sowed straight at Hampton.

                  Many men
                  Plant acorns for their successors; thisKing sets
                  A gourd.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The Prophet's gourd. We are all mortal.
                  Sow but a grain of mustard, the green thing
                  Which soonest springs from death to life, and thou
                  Shalt wither ere the leaflets shoot.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  The King
                  Deems that we dare not try him.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Dare not! Cromwell
                  
                  How soon dost think—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Was't not the plash of oars?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Cromwell!
               
               
                  Ire.
                  He hears thee not. His sense rejects
                  All sound save that for which with such intense
                  And passionate zeal he listens. See his cheek
                  Quivers with expectation. Its old hue
                  Of ruddy brown is gone.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Hark! Hark! my masters!
                  He is come! He is come! We are about to do
                  A deed which shall draw on us
                        questioning eyes
                  From the astonished nations. Men shall gaze
                  Afeared and wondering on this spot of earth,
                  As on a comet in the Heavens, fatal
                  To Kings of old. Start ye? Why at the first
                  
                     I started, as a man who in a dream
                  Sees indistinct and terrible grim forms
                  Of death and danger float before his glazed
                  And wondering eyes; but then as one who wakes
                  The inspiring light fell on me, and I saw
                  The guiding hand of Providence visibly
                  Beckoning to the great combat. We are His soldiers
                  Following the Cloud by day, the Fire by night:—
                  And shall we not be constant? We are arrayed
                  Against the stiff combined embodied spirits
                  Of prelacy and tyranny:—Shall we not
                  Be bold?
                  (The King, Herbert, 
                  Harrison, &c. pass the window)
                  See! See! he passes! So shall pass
                  The oppressor from the earth. His very shadow
                  The very traces of his foot are gone,
                  And the English ground is free, the English air
                  Free, free!—All praise be to His mighty name!
                  This is the crowning work.

                  SCENE II.
               —A Gallery leading to the 
                     King's
                           Prison.
               The Queen, Lady Fairfax, a
                  Centinel.
               
                  Lady Fairfax.
                  Another guard! The pass-word that hath served us
                  Through court, and gate, and hall, will fail us here;
                  This is the immediate prison of the King.
                  Say, Royal Madam, had we best accost
                  Yon centinel?
               
               
                  Queen.
                  The prison of the King!
                  And I have lived to hear those words that pierce
                  
                     My heart like daggers spoken familiarly
                  As she would say good day or fare ye well!
                  The prison of the King! England hath
                     been
                  His prison—but this one leads—My Lady Fairfax
                  
                  Command him to admit us.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  He draws nigh.
               
               
                  Centinel.
                  Fair mistresses how won ye here? This gallery
                  Leads to the prisoner's chambers.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  We would see him.
                  Admit us.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  Be ye frenetic? Know ye not
                  That, save the Lords Commissioners none dare
                  Approach the prisoner?
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Say the King.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  Who art thou
                  That speak'st with such command?
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Know'st thou not me?
                  Thy General's wife.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  I am of Cromwell's soldiers,
                  And own no woman's rule.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Admit us, slave!
                  I am the Queen, thy Queen, the Queen of
                        England!
                  Make way.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  Stand back I say.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  I am a wife
                  Seeking her husband in his prison. Soldier,
                  If thou have a man's heart!
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Here's money for thee—
                  Admit her.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  I have fought in twenty fields
                  A veteran of the cause. Put up your gold.
                  And, madam, please you home!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Here is my home,—
                  My husband's prison gate. I'll live here, die here,
                  
                     Here will I watch without as he within,
                  Till death, the great deliverer comes to free
                  The captives. This shall be my grave. Charles!Charles!
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Peace! Peace!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  I thought I heard him. Charles! myCharles!
                  My King! My Husband!
               
               
                  Cent.
                  There are many chambers
                  Between thee and the King. I prythee hence!
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Madam, take patience.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Charles! He must be
                     dead
                  Already that he answers not.

                  Crom.
                  What means
                  This clamourous din of female tongues so near
                  The prison of the King? The Lady Fairfax!

                     The Queen!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Cromwell I hated thee,
                  Yet open yonder door, and I'll pray for thee
                  All my life long. Yon churlish centinel—

                  Crom.
                  The word is Naseby.
                  
               
               
                  Queen.

               (Exeunt Queen and Centinel )
               
                  Crom.
                  Now my good Lady Fairfax,
                  Right well beseemeth christian charity
                  To succour them that suffer; howsoe'er
                  Midst strict professors it may breed some marvel
                  That one so famed for rigid sanctity,
                  The gravest matron of the land should herd
                  With yonder woman.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  
                     With the Queen?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  A papist;
                  A rank Idolater; a mumming masquer;
                  A troller of lewd songs; a wanton dancer;
                  A vain upholder of that strength of Satan
                  
                  The playhouse. They that be so eminent
                  As thou will find maligners; 'tis the curse
                  Of our poor fallen nature. Be not seen
                  Hovering about these walls. I speak in love
                  Of the Lord General.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  The Lord General,
                  And many a godly minister, and I,
                  Weak woman though I be, mourn that these walls
                  Should come between the Kingand people. Peace
                  Had been a holier bond.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Peace! that our General
                  The good Lord Fairfax, Captain of the guard,
                  Should tend the popish ladies to their mass;—
                  A high promotion! Peace! That every dungeon
                  May swarm with pious ministers;—forget they
                  Their old oppressions? Peace! that the grave matron
                  The Lady Fairfax may with troubled thoughts
                  Sit witness of lewd revels; mock and scorn
                  Of the light dames of the chamber, and the lordlings
                  Their gallants;—popinjays who scoff and jeer
                  At the staid solemn port, the decent coif,
                  The modest kerchief. I have heard such jeers
                  When yon gay Queen hath laughed.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Laughed! Hath she dared!
                  Vain minion!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  And to see thee with her! Thou
                  That shouldst have been a Jael in this land,
                  A Deborah, a Judith!
                  
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Nay, we live
                  Under a milder law. Whate'er their crimes
                  Urge not this bloody trial.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Whoso saith
                  That the trial shall be bloody? He who reads
                  All hearts, He only knows how my soul yearns
                  Toward yonder pair. I seek them now, a friend,
                  With friendly proffers. As we reach thy coach
                  I'll tell thee more. Come, madam!
               
               (Exeunt.)
               
                  SCENE III.
                  —The King's Apartments
                  The King and Herbert.
                  
                     King.
                     
                        Herbert!
                  
                  
                     Her.
                     An please your Majesty.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Go seek
                     The General.
                  
                  
                     Her.
                     
                        Fairfax?
                  
                  
                     King.
                     
                        Cromwell!
                        Cromwell!
                        say
                     The King commands his presence.
                     (Exit Herbert)
                     To fore-run him,
                     To plunge at once into this stormy sea
                     Of griefs, to summon my great foe, to front
                     The obdurate Commons, the fanatic army,
                     Even the mock judges, they who dare to reign
                     Over a King, to breast them all! Then trial,
                     Or peace! Death or the crown! Rest comes with either
                     To me and England, comfortable
                              rest,
                     After my many wanderings.
                  
                  Enter the Queen
                  
                  
                     
                        Henrietta!
                     My wife, my Queen, is't thou? Is't not a dream?
                     
                        For I have dreamed so, and awakened—Heaven
                     Shield me from such a waking! Is't a truth?
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Do not my tears give answer? Did that vision
                     Rain drops of joy like these?
                  
                  
                     King.
                     To see thee here
                     Is to be young and free again, again 
                     A bridegroom and a King.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Ever my King!
                  
                  
                     King.
                     I have heard nothing like that voice of hope
                     Since we were parted.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Wherefore dost thou pause?
                     Why gaze on me so mournfully?
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Alas!
                     Thou art pale, my Henrietta, very pale; 
                     And this dear hand that was so round and fair
                     Is thin and wan—Oh very wan!
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     'Twas pining
                     For thee that made it so. Think on the cause,
                     And thou'lt not mourn its beauty.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     And this grief,
                     Will kill her! Joined to any other man
                     She might have lived on in her loveliness
                     For half an age. She's mine, and she will die.
                     Oh this is a sad meeting! I have longed
                     Have prayed to see thee—now—Would thou wast safe
                     In France again, my dear one!
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Say not so.
                     I bring thee comfort, safety. Holland, France,
                     Are firmly with thee; save the army, all
                     This rebel England
                        is thine own; and e'en
                     Amid the Army
                        some the greatest, some 
                     That call themselves thy judges. 'Tis the turn 
                     Of fate; the reflux of the tide.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Forget not
                     
                        That I am a prisoner, sweet-one; a foredoomed
                     Discrowned prisoner. As erewhile I passed
                     Sadly along, a soldier in his mood
                     Spat on me: none rebuked him; none cried shame;
                     None cleft the coward to the earth.
                     
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Oh traitors!
                     Oh sacrilegious rebels! Let my lips
                     Wipe off that scorn. My Charles, thou shalt resume
                     Thy state, shalt sit enthroned, a judge, a King,
                     Even in the solemn 
                           Hall   
                     , the lofty seat
                     Of their predestined treason. For thy life
                     It is assured—Lord
                           Broghilland a band
                     Of faithful Cavaliers—But thou shalt reign.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Dost thou remember Cromwell? Ere thou quitted'st
                     
                        England he was most like the delving worm
                     Hypocrisy; that slough is cast, and now
                     His strong and shining wings soar high in air
                     As proud ambition. First demand of him
                     What King shall reign.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     He is my trust.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Hast seen him?
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     He sent me to thee now.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Ha, wherefore! But I've learned to trust in nought
                     Save Heaven. Since thou art here I am content
                     To live and reign, but all in honour. I'll 
                     Renounce no creed, resign no friend, abandon
                     No right or liberty of this abused
                     Misguided people; no nor bate one jot
                     Of the old prerogative, my
                        
                        privilege,
                     The right divine of Kings. Death were to me
                     As welcome as his pleasant evening rest
                     To the poor way-worn traveller;—And yet 
                     
                        I fain would live for thee—Cheer up, fair wife!—
                     Would live for love and thee. Hast seen thy
                           children?
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Not yet. They say Elizabeth, whose face
                     Even when a little child resembled thine,
                     To wonder, hath pined after thee, and fed
                     Her love by thinking on thee, till she hath stolen
                     Unconsciously thy mien and tone and words
                     Of patient pensiveness; a dignity
                     Of youthful sorrow, beautiful and sad.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Poor child! poor child! a woeful heritage!
                     When I have gazed on the sweet seriousness
                     Of her young beauty, I have pictured her
                     In the bright May of life, a Queenly bride,
                     Standing afore the altar with that look
                     Regal and calm, and pure as the azure skies
                     
                        Of Paradise ere tears were born. Now—
                     Enter Cromwell.
                     Cromwell!
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Did'st thou desire my presence?
                  
                  
                     King.
                     I sent for thee
                     To bear my message to thy comrades.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Sir,
                     I wait thy pleasure. I would welcome thee
                     Unto this goodly city—
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Doth the gaoler
                     Welcome his prisoner? I am Charles Stuart,
                     And thou—Now shame on this rebellious blood!
                     I thought that it was disciplined and schooled
                     Into proud patience. Let me not appear
                     Discourteous—Sir, the King is bounden to thee!
                     Now hear mine errand.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Tush, hear me!
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     The Queen!
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Fie! doff this strangeness, when it was thyself
                     That sent me hither! Cast aside the smooth
                     Obedient looks which hide thy thoughts. Be plain
                     And honest,Cromwell.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     I have ever been so.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Open in speech and heart, even as myself
                     When I, thy Queen, hold out the hand of peace
                     And amity, and bid thee say what title
                     The King shall give to his great General.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     None.
                     Thou bad'st me answer plainly.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Yet thou wast 
                     Ambitious once.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Grant that I were,—as well
                     I trust I had more grace,—but say I were so,
                     Think'st thou not there be homely names which sound
                     As sweetly in men's ears? which shall outlive
                     A thousand titles in that book of fame,
                     History? All praise be to the Lord I am not
                     Ambitious.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Chuse thine office. Keep the name
                     Thy sword hath rendered famous. Be Lord Vicar;
                     Be Captain of the Guard; forbid this suit—
                     Thou can'st an if thou wilt—be Charles's friend
                     And second man in the kingdom.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Second! Speak'st thou
                     These tempting words to me? I nor preside
                     O'er court or Parliament; I am not, Madam,
                     Lord General of the
                           Army. Seek those great ones.
                     My place is in the ranks. Would'st thou make me 
                     The second in the kingdom? Seek those great ones.
                     The second!
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Thou, and well thou know'st it, Cromwell, 
                     Art the main prop of this rebellion! General,
                     Lord President, what are they but thy tools,
                     Thy puppets, moved by thy directing will
                     As chessmen by the skilful player. 'Tis thou
                     That art the master-spirit of the time,
                     Idol of people and of army, leader
                     Of the fanatic Commons, judge, sole judge
                     Of this unrighteous cause.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     And she would make me
                     The second man of the kingdom! Thou but troublest
                     Thyself and me.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Yet hear me but one word.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     No more of bribes!—thou bad'st me to speak plainly:
                     Thou hast been bred in courts and deemest them
                     Omnipotent o'er all. But I eschew
                     The Mammon of unrighteousness. I warn ye
                     Ye shall learn faith in one man's honesty
                     Before ye die.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Never in thine! At Holmby
                     
                     We trusted—Fool again—'Twas not in fear;
                     I dread thee not. Thou dar'st not try the King.
                     The very word stands as a double guard,
                     A triple armour, a bright shield before him;
                     A sacred halo plays around the head
                     Anointed andendiademed, a dim
                     Mysterious glory. Who may dare to call
                     For justice on a King? Who dare to touch
                     The crowned and lofty head?
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Was it at Hardwick,
                     Or Fotheringay,—fie on my dull brain—
                     That the fair Queen of Scots, the
                        popish woman,
                     The beautiful, his grandame died?
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     A Queen,
                     A vain and envious woman, yet a Queen,
                     Condemned Queen
                        Mary. Ye are subjects, rebels,
                     Ye dare not try your King; all else ye may do;
                     All else ye have done; fought, imprisoned, chased,
                     Aye, tracked and hunted, like that pious Henry,
                     The last of the red-rose, whom visiting
                     Helpless in prison, his arch enemy
                     The fiendish
                        Richard slew;—even as perchance—
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Shame on thy slanderous tongue! There lies my sword.
                     
                     Did'st take me for a murderer? Harken, Madam;
                     When thou shalt speak again of Henry's death,
                     Remember 'twas the restless shrew of Anjou
                     
                     That drove her gentle husband to his end.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Take up the sword; and, wife, I prythee peace!
                     I yet am King enough to end these brawls.
                     Take up thy sword! Albeit my breast be bare,
                     And I unarmed before him, he'll not strike.
                     That were an honest murder. There be ways
                     Stiller and darker; there be men whose craft 
                     Can doom with other tongues, with other hands
                     Can slay. I know thee, Sir.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     I would not slay
                     A sinner unprepared.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Go to! I know thee.
                     Say to the Parliament that I demand
                     A conference Lords andCommons.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Sir, the Commons
                     
                     Will grant no conference. Thou must address thee
                     To the High Court of Justice, to thy judges.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Oh vain and shallow treason! Have ye not
                     The King's High Court, the judges of the land?
                     I own no other. Yet if they—
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Expect
                     
                        Nothing of them but justice. I came to thee,
                     As to a brother, in pure charity,
                     In meek and Christian love, when these sharp taunts
                     Arose betwixt us. Still I fain would save thee.
                     Resign the crown.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Never.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Oh vanity
                     Of man's proud heart! cling to that sinful toy
                     A sound, an echo, a dim shadow, weakening
                     As the true substance flies,—cling to that word,
                     And cast away thy life!
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Hold Henrietta!
                     What! Dost thou ask me for so poor a boon
                     As life to change fair honour? I've a son,
                     A gallant princely boy—would'st have me yield
                     The old ancestral crown, his heritage,
                     For the small privilege to crawl awhile
                     On this vile earth, mated with fouler worms
                     Than they that sleep below? Would'st have me sell
                     My Kingdom for a little breath?
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Thy Kingdom!
                     Thou hast not a stronghold left.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     I have one here.
                     Thou know'st my answer.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Yet if there be danger—
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Peace, dearest, peace! Is the day fixed?
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     The day,
                     The very hour, is set. At noon tomorrow,
                     Heaven permitting—
                  
                  
                     King.
                     The decrees of Heaven
                     Be oft to man's dark mind inscrutable:
                     The lightning flame hath fired the straw-thatched roof
                     Of harmless cottagers, hath rent the spire
                     Of consecrated temples, hath struck down
                     Even the dumb innocent oak that never lied
                     Never rebelled, never blasphemed. A veil
                     Hangs before Heaven's high purpose. Yet when man
                     Slays man, albeit no King, a reckoning comes
                     A deep and awful reckoning. I'll abide
                     The trial.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     At thy peril.
                  
                  END OF THE SECOND ACT.
               
            
         
         
            
               Act III.
            
               SCENE I.
               
                  Westminster Hall fitted up for the King's
                        trial.
               
                  Bradshaw, seated as President; Cromwell, Ireton, Harrison, Downes, Marten, Tichburne, and other Judges on benches; Cook, and other Lawyers, Clerks, &c., at a table; a chair of State for the King on one side; the Queen, veiled, and other Ladies in a Gallery behind; the whole stage filled with Guards Spectators, &c., &c.
               
                  Brad.
                  Hath every name been called? And every Judge
                  Appeared at the high summons?
               
               
                  Clerk.
                  Good my Lord,
                  Each one hath answered.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  (to Cromwell)
                  The Lord General
                  
                  Is wanting still.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The better.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  How?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Fair son
                  We have enow of work—Doth not you cry 
                  Announce the prisoner?—enow of work
                  For one brief day without him.—Downes sit here
                  Beside me man.—We lack not waverers;
                  Men whose long doubts would hold from rosy dawn
                  
                     To the slow lighting of the evening star
                  In the clear Heaven of June. Of such as they
                  One were too many. How say'st thou good Downes?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Even as thou say'st.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Yet 'tis a valiant General,
                  A godly and a valiant. Ha! the prisoner!
               
               Enter the King, Herbert, and other Servants, Hacker and guards.
               (The Soldiers &c. as the King walks to his chair cry Justice! Justice!)
               
                  Crier.
                  Peace! silence in the court!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Ye shall have justice.
                  My LordsCommissioners, whilst I
                     stood pausing
                  How fitliest to disclose our mighty plea,
                  Dallying with phrase and form, yon eager cry
                  Shot like an arrow to the mark, laying bare
                  The very core of our intent. Sirs, we
                  Are met to render justice, met to judge
                  In such a cause as scarce the lucent sun
                  That smiles upon us from his throne hath seen
                  Since light was born. We sit to judge a King
                  Arraigned by his own people; to make inquest
                  Into the innocent blood which hath been spilled
                  Like water; into crime and tyranny,
                  Treason and murder. Look that we be pure
                  My brethren! that we cast from out our hearts
                  All blinding passions: Fear that blinks and trembles
                  At shadows ere they come; Pride that walks dazzled
                  In the light of her vainglory; feeble Pity
                  Whose sight is quenched in tears; and grim Revenge
                  Her fierce eyes sealed with gore. Look that we chase
                  
                     Each frail affection, each fond hidden sin, 
                  Each meaner virtue from our hearts, and cling
                  To Justice, only Justice. Now for thee
                  
                     Charles Stuart King
                     of England: Thou art here
                  To render compt of awful crimes, of treason
                  Conspiracy and murder. Answer!
               
               
                  Cook.
                  First
                  May it please you hear the charge?
               
               
                  King.
                  Stop! Who are ye
                  That dare to question me?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Thy Judges.
               
               
                  King.
                  Say
                  My subjects. I am a King whom none may judge 
                  On earth. Who sent ye here?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  The Commons.
               
               
                  King.
                  What!
                  Be there no traitors, no conspirators
                  No murderers save Kings, that they dare call
                  Stern justice down from Heaven? Sir I fling back
                  The charge upon their heads, the guilt, the shame,
                  The eternal infamy,—on them who sowed
                  The tares of hate in fields of love; who armed
                  Brother 'gainst brother, breaking the sweet peace
                  Of country innocence, the holy ties
                  Of nature breaking, making war accurst
                  As that Egyptian plague the worst and last
                  When the First-born were slain. I have no answer
                  For them or ye. I know ye not.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Be warned;
                  Plead to the accusation.
               
               
                  King.
                  I will die
                  A thousand deaths, rather than by my breath
                  Give life to this new court against the laws
                  And liberties of England.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  
                     Sir we know 
                  Your love of liberty andEngland. Call
                  The witnesses. Be they in court?
               
               
                  Cook.
                  They wait
                  Without.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Send for them quickly. Once again
                  King wilt thou plead?
               
               
                  King.
                  Thou hast my answer, never.
               
               (A pause of a few moments during which the head of the King's
                        staff on which he was leaning falls and rolls across the stage.)
               
                  Mar.
                  (to Ireton)
                  What fell? The breathless silence of this vast
                  And crowded court gives to each common sound
                  A startling clearness. What hath fallen?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  The head
                  Of the King's staff. See how it spins and bounds
                  Along the floor, as hurrying to forsake
                  The royal wretch its master. Now it stops
                  At Cromwell's
                     feet—direct at Cromwell's feet.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The toy is broken.
               
               
                  Har.
                  What is the device?
                  Some vain Idolatrous image?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No, a crown;
                  A gilded crown, a hollow glittering crown,
                  Shaped by some quaint and cunning goldsmith. Look
                  On what a reed he leans, who props himself
                  On such a bauble.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  It rolled straight to thee;—
                  If thou wast superstitious—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Pass the toy
                  On to the prisoner! he hath faith in omens—
                  I—fling him back his gewgaw!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  
                     Master Cook
                  
                  We wait too long.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  My Lord the witnesses—
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Call any man. Within our bleeding land
                  There lives not one so blest in ignorance
                  As not to know this treason. None so high
                  But the storm overtopped him; none so low
                  But the wind stooped to root him up. Call any man
                  The Judge upon the bench, the Halberdier
                  That guards the door.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  
                     Oliver
                     Cromwell!
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye?
               
               
                  Cook.
                  No need to swear him. He hath ta'en already 
                  The Judges' oath.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The Judges' oath, not this. 
                  Omit no form of guardian law, remember
                  The life of man hangs on our lips.
               
               
                  King.
                  Smooth traitor!
               
               (Cromwell is
                        sworn.)
               
                  Cook.
                  Lieutenant General Cromwell, wast thou present
                  In the great fight of Naseby?
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Was I present!
                  Why I think ye know that. I was.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  Didst see
                  The prisoner in the battle?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Many times.
                  He led his army,
                     in a better cause
                  I should have said right gallantly. I saw him
                  First in the onset, last in the retreat.
                  That justice let me pay the King.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Raised he
                  His banner 'gainst his people? Didst thou see
                  
                     The royal standard in the field?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  My Lord
                  It rose full in the centre of their host
                  Floating upon the heavy air.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  The arms 
                  Of England?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye, the very lion shield
                  That waved at 
                        
                           Cressi
                           Crécy
                        
                     and at 
                        
                           Azincourt
                           Agincourt
                        
                     
                  
                  Triumphant. None may better know than I,
                  For it so pleased the Ruler of the Field,
                  The Almighty King of Battles, that my arm
                  Struck down the standard-bearer and restored
                  The English lion to
                     the lion hearts
                  Of England.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  Please you, Sir, retire. Now summon—
               
               
                  King.
                  Call not another. What I have done boldly,
                  In the face of day and of the nation, that,
                  Nothing repenting, nothing derogating
                  From the King's high perogative,as boldly
                  As freely I avow—to you—to all men.
                  I own ye not as Judges. Ye have power
                  As pirates or land robbers o'er the wretch
                  Entrapped within their den, a power to mock
                  Your victim with a form of trial, to dress
                  Plain murder in a mask of law. As Judges
                  I know ye not.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Enough that you confess 
                  The treason—
               
               
                  King.
                  Stop! Sir, I appeal to them
                  Whence you derive your power.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  The people? King
                  Thou seest them here in us.
               
               
                  King.
                  Oh that my voice
                  Could reach my loyal people! That the winds
                  
                     Could waft the echoes of this groined roof
                  So that each corner of the land might hear,
                  From the fair Southern vallies to
                     the hills
                  Of my own native North, from the
                           bleak shores
                  Of the great ocean to the channeled West,
                  Their rightful Monarch's cry. Then should ye hear
                  From the universal nation, town and plain,
                  Forest and village, the stern awful shout
                  Of just deliverance, mighty and prolonged,
                  Deafening the earth and piercing Heaven, and smiting
                  Each guilty conscience with such fear as waits 
                  On the great Judgment-Day. The wish is vain—
                  Ah! vainer than a dream! I and my people
                  Are over-mastered. Yet, Sir, I demand
                  A conference with these masters. Tell the Commons
                  
                  The King would speak with them.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  We have no power
                  To stay the trial.
                  
                  
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Nay, good my Lord, perchance
                  The King would yield such reason as might move
                  The Commons to renew the treaty. Best
                  Confer with them.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (to Downes)
                  Art mad?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  'Tis ye are mad
                  That urge with a remorseless haste this work 
                  Of savage butchery onward. I was mad
                  That joined ye.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  This is sudden.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  He's our King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Our King! Have we not faced him in the field
                  A thousand times? Our King! Downes, hath the
                     Lord
                  Forsaken thee? Why I have seen thyself
                  Hewing through mailed battalia, till thy sword
                  And thy good arm were dyed in gore, to reach
                  
                     Yon man. Didst mean to save him? Listen, Sir,
                  I am thy friend. 'Tis said,—I lend no ear
                  To slanderers, but this tale was forced upon me—
                  'Tis said that one whose grave and honoured name
                  Sorts ill with midnight treachery, was seen
                  Stealing from the Queen's lodging!—I'm thy friend, 
                  Thy fast friend! We oft see in this bad world
                  The shadow Envy crawling stealthily
                  Behind fair Virtue;—I hold all for false
                  Unless thou prove it true;—I am thy friend!—
                  But if the sequestrators heard this tale—
                  Thou hast broad lands.
                        (Aloud)
                     Why do ye pause?
               
               
                  Cook.
                  My high
                  And honouring task to plead at this great bar
                  For lawful liberty, for suffering conscience,
                  For the old guardians of our rights the Commons,
                  Against the lawless fiend Prerogative,
                  The persecuting Church, the tyrant King,
                  Were needless now and vain. The haughty prisoner
                  Denies your jurisdiction. I call on ye
                  For instant judgment.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Sir, for the last time
                  I ask thee, wilt thou plead? 
               
               
                  King.
                  Have I not answered? 
               
               
                  Cook.
                  Your judgment, good my Lords!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  All ye who deem
                  
                     Charles Stuart
                     guilty, rise!
               
               (The Judges all stand up.)
               
                  King.
                  What all!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Not one
                  Is wanting. Clerk, record him guilty.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  Now
                  The sentence!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     (from the Gallery)
                  Traitors, hold!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (To Ireton)
                  Heard'st thou a scream?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  'Tis the malignant wife of
                        Fairfax.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No!
                  A greater far than she.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Hold, murderers!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (aloud)
                  Lead
                  Yon railing woman from her seat. My Lord,
                  Please you proceed.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  (rushing to the King)
                  Traitors, here is my seat—
                  I am the Queen;—here is my place, my state,
                  My Lord and Sovereign,—here at thy feet.
                  I claim it with a prouder humbler heart,
                  A lowlier duty, a more loyal love,
                  Than when the false and glittering diadem
                  Encircled first my brow, a queenly bride.
                  Put me not from thee! scorn me not! I am
                  Thy wife.
               
               
                  King.
                  Oh true and faithful wife! Yet leave me,
                  Lest the strong armour of my soul, her patience,
                  Be melted by thy tears. Oh go! go! go!
                  This is no place for thee.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Why thou art here!
                  Who shall divide us?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Force her from him, Guards;
                  Remove her.
               
               
                  King.
                  Tremble ye who come so near
                  As but to touch her garments. Cowards! Slaves!
                  Though the King's power be gone, yet the man's
                     strength
                  Remains unwithered. She's my wife; my all.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  None thinks to harm the Lady. Good my Lord,
                  The hour wears fast with these slight toys.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     I come
                  To aid ye not impede. If in this land
                  To wear the lineal crown, maintain the laws,
                  Uphold the insulted Church, be crimes, then I
                  Am guilty, guiltier than your King. 'Twas I
                  That urged the war—ye know he loved me;—I
                  That prompted his bold councils; edged and whetted
                  His great resolves; spurred his high courage on
                  Against ye, rebels! I that armed my knight
                  And sent him forth to battle. Mine the crime;—
                  Be mine the punishment! Deliver him,
                  And lead me to the block. Pause ye? My blood
                  Is royal too. Within my veins the rich
                  Commingled stream of princely Medici
                  
                  And regal Bourbon flows: 'Twill mount as high, 
                  Twill stain your axe as red, t'will feed as full 
                  Your hate of Kings.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Madam, we wage no war
                  On women.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  I have warred on ye, and now—
                  Take heed how ye release me!He is gentle
                  Patient and kind; he can forgive. But I
                  Shall roam a frantic widow through the world,
                  Counting each day for lost that hath not gained
                  An enemy to England, a revenger
                  Of this foul murder.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Woman, peace! The sentence!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Yoursentence, bloody judges! As ye deal
                  With your anointed King the red right arm
                  Of Heaven shall avenge him: here on earth
                  By clinging fear and black remorse, and death
                  Unnatural ghastly death, and then the fire,
                  The eternal fire, where panting murderers gasp
                  
                     And cannot die, that deepest Hell which holds
                  The Regicide.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Peace! I have overlong
                  Forgotten my great office. Hence! or force
                  Shall rid us of thy frenzy. Know'st thou not
                  That curses light upon the curser's head,
                  As surely as the cloud which the sun drains
                  From the salt sea returns into the wave
                  In stormy gusts or plashing showers? Remove her.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Oh mercy! mercy! I'll not curse; I'll be
                  As gentle as a babe. Ye cannot doom him
                  Whilst I stand by. Even the hard headsman veils
                  His victim's eyes before he strikes, afeared
                  Lest his heart fail. And could ye, being men
                  Not fiends, abide a wife's keen agony
                  Whilst—I'll not leave thee Charles! I'll never leave thee
               
               
                  King.
                  This is the love stronger than life, the love
                  Of woman. Henrietta, listen. Loose
                  Thy arms from round my neck; here is no axe;
                  This is no scaffold. We shall meet anon
                  Untouched, unharmed; I shall return to thee
                  Safe, safe,—shall bide with thee. Listen my dear
                           one,
                  Thy husband prays, thy King commands thee, Go!
                  Go! Lead her gently, very gently.
                  (Exit the Queen, led.)
                  Now
                  I am ready. Speak your doom, and quickly.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Death.
                  Thou art adjudged to die. Sirs, do ye all
                  Accord in this just sentence?
               
               The Judges all stand up.
               
                  King.
                  I am ready.
                  To a grey head, aching with royal cares,
                  The block is a kind pillow. Yet once more—
               
               
                  Brad.
                  
                     Silence. The Sentence is pronounced; the time
                  Is past. Conduct him from the Court.
               
               
                  King.
                  Not hear me!
                  Me your anointed King! Look ye what justice
                  A meaner man may hope for.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Why refuse
                  His death-speech to a prisoner? Whoso knoweth
                  What weight hangs on his soul. Speak on and fear not.
               
               
                  King.
                  Fear! Let the guilty fear. Feel if my pulse
                  Flutter? Look if my cheek be faded? Harken
                  If my calm breathing be not regular,
                  Even as an infant's who hath dropt asleep
                  Upon its mother's breast? As I lift up
                  This Sword, miscalled of Justice, my clear voice
                  Hoarsens nor falters not. See, I can smile
                  As thinking on the axe, I draw the bright
                  
                     Keen edge across my hand. Fear! Would ye ask
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                  
                  What weight is on my soul, I tell ye none 
                  Save that I yielded once to your
                     decree, 
                  And slew my Faithfullest. Oh
                        Strafford!
                     Strafford!
                  
                  This is a retribution!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Better weep 
                  Thy sins than one just holy act.
               
               
                  King.
                  For ye 
                  My subject-judges I couldweep; for thee 
                  Beloved and lovely country. Thou wilt groan 
                  Under the tyrant Many till some bold
                  And crafty soldier, one who in the field
                  Is brave as the roused lion, at the Council
                  Watchful and gentle as the couchant pard,
                  The lovely spotted pard, what time she stoops
                  To spring upon her prey; one who puts on,
                  
                     To win each several soul, his several sin,
                  A stern fanatic, a smooth hypocrite,
                  A fierce rebublican, a coarse buffoon,
                  Always a great bad
                        man; till he shall come,
                  And climb the vacant throne, and fix
                     him there,
                  A more than King. Cromwell, if such thou know'st
                  Tell him the rack would prove an easier couch
                  Than he shall find that throne; tell him the crown
                  On an Usurper's brow will scorch and burn,
                  As though the diamonded and ermined round
                  Were framed of glowing steel.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Hath His dread wrath
                  Smitten thee with frenzy?
               
               
                  King.
                  Tell him, for thou know'st him,
                  That Doubt and Discord like fell harpies wait
                  Around the Usurper's board. By night, by day, 
                  Beneath the palace roof, beneath that roof
                  More fair, the summer sky, fear shall appal
                  And danger threaten, and all natural loves
                  Wither and die; till on his dying bed, 
                  Old fore his time, the wretched traitor lies
                  Heartbroken. Then, for well thou know'st him,
                     Cromwell,
                  Bid him to think on me, and how I  fell 
                  Hewn in my strength and prime, like a proud oak,
                  The tallest of the forest, that but shivers 
                  His glorious top and dies. Oh! thou shalt envy, 
                  In thy long agony, my fall, that shakes 
                  A kingdom but not me. 
                  
               
               
                  Bradshaw.
                  
               
               
                  Soldiers.
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Soldiers.
                  
                  
               
               
               
                  Crom.
                  He is possessed!—
                  My good Lord President, the day wears on—
                  Possessed of a fierce Devil!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Lead him forth.

                  Why so. Ye are warned.
                  On to my prison, Sirs!
                  On to my prison!

                  Nay, my comrades,
                  Vex not a sinner's parting hour. The wrath
                  Is on him, Harrison!

                  SCENE I.
               An Apartment in Cromwell's House.
               
                  Cromwell alone.
               
                  Crom.
                  So, my lord Broghill! We are shrewdly rid
                  Of one bold plotter. Now to strike at once,
                  Ere fresh conspiracies—
               
               Enter Ireton.
               
                  Cromwell.
                  What mak'st thou here,
                  Fair son?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Sir,
                  The Lords Commissioners refuse 
                  To sign the warrant. He'll escape us yet.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Refuse! What all?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  No; HarrisonandBradshaw still hold firm.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Too few! too few!
                  Aye, he'll escape. They'll treat. What say the traitors?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  The most keep stubborn silence. Harrison
                  
                  Is hoarse with railing.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Overhot! But that's
                  A fault may pass for virtue. Overcold's, 
                  Your modish sin. Weakness or treachery!
                  
                     Peters or Judases! They'll treat. They'll treat.
                  
                     Where lies thy regiment?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  At Westminster.
                  One glance of their bright swords, one stirring note
                  Of their war-trumpet, and these dastard Judges—
                  I'll seek them instantly.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Son, thou mistak'st. 
                  Foul shame it were here in a Christian land 
                  To govern by brute force—How many hast thou? 
               
               
                  Ire.
                  A thousand horse.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Or turn their very guards
                  Against the Judges—Be they trusty?
                  
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Sir,
                  I'll answer for them as myself.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Nay, go not.
                  No force, good Son! No force! 
                  Enter a Servant.
                  What wouldst thou? Speak.
               
               
                  Servant.
                  The Colonel Harrison
                     sends me to crave 
                  Your Excellency's presence.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye! I come. 
                  Didst meet thy fellow Robert, and the gallant 
                  Whom thou saw'st here this morning?
               
               
                  Serv.
                  Sir, they passed me 
                  At speed.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I come. No force, good son. Remember 
                  This is a Christian land. We must keep pure
                  The Judgment seat. No force.
                  (Exit Ireton.)
                  At speed! Ere now
                  They have crost the Thames at
                        Kew. We are quit of one
                  Bold Cavalier. What said the Colonel?
               
               
                  Serv.
                  Prayed
                  Your instant presence, and betwixt his teeth
                  Muttered "Faint craven souls!"
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Fie! Fie! to speak 
                  Irreverently of such great-ones. Faint 
                  And craven souls! Follow my son;thou'lt find him
                  Heading his valiant horse. Bid him be still
                  Till I send to him—still as night. And now
                  For ye wise Judges!

               SCENE II.
               The Painted Chamber.
               
               
                  Bradshaw, Harrison, Cook, Downes, Tichburne, Marten, and other Judges.
               
                  Har.
                  Be ye all smit with palsy? Hang your arms
                  Dead at your sides, that ye refuse to sign
                  The Warrant? Be ye turned Idolaters?
                  Rank worshippers of Baal?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  They refuse not.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  They parley, Sir, they dally, they delay.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  The wiser if they did. 'Twere vantage ground,
                  The keen axe swinging o'er his head, to treat
                  With yon great prisoner.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Treat! Was yonder trial
                  
                  A mummery, a stage-play, a farce? Oh blind
                  And stubborn generation!
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The whole people
                  Are struck with awe and pity. Each man's cheek
                  Is pale; each woman's eye is wet; each child
                  Lifts up its little hands as to implore
                  Mercy for the poor King.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Captivity
                  And bondage will o'ertake them! They fall off
                  Like the revolted Tribes. Ægyptian bondage!
               
               (Enter Cromwell.)
               
                  Crom.
                  Wherefore so loud good Colonel? Sirs, I shame
                  To have held ye waiting here.A sudden cause,
                  I pray ye believe it urgent, hindered me.
                  Where is the warrant? Have ye left a space
                  For my poor name?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Thou wilt find room enow.
                  There!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  What unsigned?—Harrison!—He came hither 
                  To crave your signatures.
               
               
                  Har.
                  I did my message!
                  But these Philistines—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Do ye shame to set 
                  Your names to your own deeds? Did ye not pass
                  This solemn sentence in the face of day,
                  Before the arraigned King, the shouting people,
                  The majesty of Heaven?
               
               
                  Tich.
                  Thou dost mistake us.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I crave your pardon, Sirs. I deemed ye were
                  The judges, the King's judges, the elect 
                  Of England, chosen by her godly Commons
                  
                  As wisest, boldest, best. I did mistake ye.

                  Listen, ere thou accuse us.
               
               
                  Mar.

                  Well.

                  We have here Commissioners from Scotland
                  
                  Praying our mercy on the King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  They gave him
                  Into our hands.
               
               
                  Har.
                  And they are answered Sir.
                  Thou know'st that Cromwell singly put
                     them down,
                  As they had been young babes.

                  Dow.
                  Hath sent pressing missives; Embassies

                  Cook.
                  But he
                  Will give a fair security, a large
                  And general amnesty. So are we freed
                  From fear of after-reckoning.

                  His cause?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Hush! Hush! None thinketh to forsake
                  The cause!
               
               
                  Tich.
                  Let Bradshaw sign. What need more names
                  Than the Lord President's?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  I am ready, Sirs,
                  An ye will follow me. The Instrument
                  Were else illegal. When ye are prepared,
                  Speak.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  My good masters, ye remember me
                  Of a passage of my boyhood.
                  (then aside to Bradshaw and Harrison
                  
                  
                  Deem me not
                  A light unmeaning trifler, recollect
                  How Nathan spake to David.(then aloud) Being a child
                  Nutting with other imps in the old copse
                  At Hinchinbroke, we saw across a wide
                  But shallow stream one overhanging hazel.
                  Whose lissome stalks were weighed by the rich fruitage
                  Almost into the water. As we stood
                  Eyeing the tempting boughs, a shining nut
                  Fell from its socket, dimpling wide around
                  The dark clear mirror. At that sight one bold
                  And hardy urchin, with myself, no less
                  In those young days a daring wight, at once
                  Plunged in the sparkling rivulet. It rose
                  Above our ancles, to our knees, half up
                  Our thighs, and my scared comrade in the midst
                  Of the stream turned roaring back, and gained the bank
                  Nutless and wet, amidst the scoffing shouts
                  Of the small people.
               
               
                  Marten.
                  And thou?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Why I bore
                  My course right on , and gained the spoil. Sirs, we
                  Have plunged kneedeep in the waters; are midway
                  The stream: Will ye turn now and leave the fruit
                  Ungathered, recreants? or hold boldly on
                  And win the holy prize of freedom? Give me
                  The warrant.
                  (signs.)So! methinks an it were not
                  Over ambitious, and that's a sin;
                  My homely name should stand alone to this
                  Most righteous scroll. Follow who list. I've left
                  A space for the Lord President.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  I'll fill it 
                  With an unworthy name.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Now, swell the roll!
                  My masters! Whither goest thou Marten? None
                  Shall stir till he hath signed. Thou a ripe scholar,
                  Not write thy name! I can write mine i' the dark,
                  And oft with my sword-point have traced in air
                  The viewless characters in the long hour
                  Before the joy of battle. Shut thine eyes,
                  And write thy name! Anywhere! See
                  (Marking Marten's cheek
                     with a pen.) 
                  NayMarten,
                  Stand still!—See! See! how fair and clerkly! Yet 
                  This parchment is the smoother.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Hold thee sure
                  I'll pay thee, General.
               
               
                  Bradshaw.
                  Why he hath marked thee
                  Like a new ruddled sheep.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  I'll pay thee.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sign.
               
               
                  Marten.
                  Willingly; joyfully.
               
               (signs.)
               
                  Crom.
                  Why so. Where goes
                  Our zealous alderman? I deemed to see
                  His name the first.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  He fears the City's safety,
                  Full, as he says, of the King's friends.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  He fears!
                  They be bold men who fearlessly do own
                  Their fears. I dare not. Fear! Sir, didst thou come
                  By water hither?
               
               
                  Tich.
                  No.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  And didst thou meet
                  No soldiers on thy way?
               
               
                  Tich.
                  Many. The streets
                  Are swarming with them.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Were they silent?
               
               
                  Tich.
                  No.
                  They called aloud for execution.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Say,
                  For justice and for execution. Marry,
                  My Ironsides know not the new state trick
                  To separate the words. Well! are not they
                  A nearer fear? Sign boldly.
               
               (Cromwell,Marten, and Downesadvance to the front)
               
               
                  Mar.
                  They flock fast.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Tis time, for plots are weaving round about us,
                  Like spider's nets in Autumn. But this morning
                  I swept one web away. Lord Broghill—
               
               
                  Mar.
                  What!
                  Hath he been here?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Is he discovered?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir,
                  I have a slow-hound's scent to track a traitor.
                  He's found and he's despatched.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  How?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Where?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  To Ireland,
                  With a commission 'gainst the rebels. 'Tis
                  An honest soldier who deserves to fight
                  For the good cause. He but mistook his side;
                  The Queen beguiled him, and the knightly sound
                  Of lloyalty. But 'tis an honest soldier.
                  He will prove faithful.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  How didst win him?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  How?
                  A word of praise, a thought of fear. How do men
                  Win traitors? Hark yeDownes! Lord Broghill left
                  A list of the King's friends amongst us here;—
                  Grave seeming Roundheads, bold and zealous soldiers,
                  High officers—I marvel not ye look
                  Distrustfully—one of renown, a Colonel,

                  Mar.
                  What was the plan?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Go sign I say.—The plan!
                  A sudden rescue, to o'erpower the guard.—
                  Ha! Ingoldsby

                  Nay, man, if thou be questioned,
                  Some dozen years hence, say that I forced thee, swear
                  Thy wicked kinsman held thy hand.—Aye,now
                  The blank is nobly filled, and bravely! now
                  I know ye once again, the pious Judges

                  Haste to my son; bid him disband his force;

                  Ye

                  In earnest thanks  for quick deliverance
                  From sudden danger. Ye knew nought of this
                  Great jeopardy, nor need ye know. Give thanks,
                  And question not. Ye are safe.

                  Did ye not hear me even now take order
                  The guard should be dispersed? Question no more.
                  Ye are so safe, that this slight parchment, Sirs,
                  May be your shield.

               SCENE III.
               The —The King's Apartments.
               Enter the King leading in the Princess Elizabethand the Duke of Gloucester.
               
                  King.
                  Here we may weep at leisure. Yon fierce ruffian
                  Will scarce pursue us here. Elizabeth,
                  I thought I had done with anger, but the soldier
                  Who gazed on thee awhile, with looks that seemed
                  To wither thy young beauty, and with words—
                  My child! my child! And I had not the power
                  To shield mine own sweet child!
               
               
                  Eliz.
                  I saw him not;
                  I heard him not: I could see none but thee;
                  Could hear no voice but thine.
               
               
                  King.
                  When I am gone
                  Who shall protect thee?
               
               
                  Glou.
                  I shall soon be tall;
                  And then—
               
               
                  King.
                  Poor boy! Elizabeth, be thou 
                  A mother to him. Rear him up in peace
                  And humbleness. Show him how sweet Content
                  Can smile on dungeon floors; how the mewed lark
                  Sings in his narrow cage. Plant patience, dearones,
                  Deep in your hearts.
                  Enter Herbert.
                  
                     Herbert, where stays the Queen?
                  Still on that hopeless quest of hope, though friends
                  Drop from her fast as leaves in Autumn?
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Sire,
                  Her Grace is absent still. But General Cromwell
                  
                  Craves audience of your Majesty.
               
               
                  King.
                  Admit him.
                  Wipe off those tears,Elizabeth. Resume
                  Thy gentle courage. Thou art a Princess.
                  Enter Cromwell.
                  
                  Sir,
                  Thou seest me with my children. Doth thine errand
                  Demand their absence?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No. I sent them to thee
                  In Christian charity. Thou hast not fallen
                  Amongst the Heathen.
               
               
                  King.
                  Howsoever sent,
                  It was a royal boon. My heart hath ached
                  With the vain agony of longing love
                  To look upon those blooming cheeks, to kiss
                  Those red and innocent lips, to hear the sound
                  Of those dear voices.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir, 'twas meet they came
                  That thou might'st see them once again, might'st say—
               
               
                  King.
                  Farewell!—I can endure the word—a last
                  Farewell! I have dwelt so long upon the thought,
                  The sound seems nothing. Ye have signed
                        the sentence?
                  Fear not to speak Sir.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Tis a grievous duty—
               
               
                  King.
                  Ye havesigned. And the day?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Tomorrow.
               
               
                  King.
                  What!
                  So soon? And yet I thank  
                        ye. Speed is mercy. 
                  Ye must away, poor children.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Nay, the children
                  May bide with thee till nightfall.
               
               
                  King.
                  Take them ,Herbert!
                  
                  Take them.
               
               
                  Children.
                  Oh! no, no, no!
               
               
                  King.
                  Dear-ones, I go 
                  On a great journey. Bless ye once again,
                  My children! We must part. Farewell.
               
               
                  Eliz.
                  Oh father,
                  Let me go with thee!
               
               
                  King.
                  Know'st thou whither?
               
               
                  Eliz.
                  Yes;
                  To Heaven. Oh take me with thee! I must die;
                  When the tree falls, the young buds wither. Take me
                  Along with thee to Heaven! Let us lie
                  Both in one grave!
               
               
                  King.
                  Now bless ye! This is death;
                  This is the bitterness of love.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Fair child
                  Be comforted.
               
               
                  King.
                  Did'st thou not pat her head?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  She minded me, all in her innocent tears,
                  Of one in mine own dwelling.
               
               
                  King.
                  Thou hast daughters;
                  Be kind to her.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I will.
               
               
                  King.
                  And the poor boy—
                  He comes not near the throne. Make not of him 
                  A puppet King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I think not of it.
               
               
                  King.
                  Take them,
                  Good Herbert! And
                     my wife—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  She shall be safe;
                   shall home to France unharmed.
               
               
                  King.
                  Now fare ye well!—
                  
                     Cromwell come back!—No, bring them not again—
                  No more of parting—bbless them! bless them! See 
                  The girl, the poor poor girl, hath wept away 
                  Her tears, and pants and shivers like a fawn
                  Dying. Oh! for some gentle face to look on
                  When she revives, or she will surely die.
               
               Exeunt Herbertand the Children.
               
                  Crom.
                  She shall be cared for.
               
               
                  King.
                  Are they gone? quite gone?
                  I might have kissed them once again, have charged them
                  To love each other.—No, 'tis best.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Thou bad'st me
                  Remain. What is thy will?
               
               
                  King.
                  Be kind to them,
                  Be very kind to them!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Have I not promised?
                  Was that what thou would'st say?
               
               
                  King.
                  No. But the love, 
                  The o'ermastering love—that was the death-pang. Cromwell,
                  Thou wilt be kind to them?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Would'st have me swear?
               
               
                  King.
                  Nay, swear not, lest I doubt. I will believe thee.
                  And for the human pity thou hast shown,
                  The touch of natural ruth, I pray thee take 
                  My thanks.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I would have saved thee. By this hand,
                  This sinful hand, I would have saved thee, King,
                  Had'st thou flung by yon bauble.
               
               
                  King.
                  There is One
                  Who reads all hearts, one who pursues all crimes,
                  From silver-tongued and bland hypocrisy 
                  To treasonous murder. The unspoken thought,
                  And the loud lie, and the accursed act,
                  Mount to His throne together. Tempt Him not.
                  I know thee for the worker of this deed,
                  And knowing pardon thee:—but tempt not Him!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Thy blood be on thy head! I would have saved thee—
                  Even now the thought stirred in me. Pardon, Lord,
                  That gazing on the father's agonies,
                  My heart of flesh waxed faint, and I forgot
                  Thy glory andThy cause, the suffering saints.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  The tyrant's tyranny, and Thy great word,
                  Freedom! Thy blood be on thy head.
               
               
                  King.
                  So be it.
               
               End of the Fourth Act.
            
         
         
            ACT V.
            
               SCENE I.
                The King's Bedchamber.
                >(On account of the length of the Tragedy, this scene is
                        omitted in representation.)
               
               
               The King, starting from his couch;Herbert asleep.
               
                  King.
                  
                     Herbert! Is't time
                     to rise? He sleeps. What sounds
                  Were those that roused me? Hark again! The clang
                  Of hammers! Yet the watch-light burns; the day
                  Is still unborn. This is a work of night,
                  Of deep funereal darkness. Each loud stroke
                  Rings like a knell, distinct, discordant, shrill,
                  Gathering, redoubling, echoing round my head,
                  Smiting me only with its sound amid
                  The slumbering city, tolling in mine ear—
                  A passing bell! It is the scaffold. Heaven
                  Grant me to tread it with as calm a heart
                  As I bear now. His sleep is troubled.Herbert!
                  
                  'Twere best to wake him. Herbert! rouse thee, man!
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Did your Grace call?
               
               
                  King.
                  Aye; we should be today
                  Early astir. I've a great business toward,
                  To exchange the kingly wreath, my crown of thorns,
                  For an eternal diadem; to die— 
                  And I would go trim as a bridegroom. Give me
                  Yon ermined cloak. If the crisp nipping frost
                  Should cause me shiver, there be tongues would call
                  The wintery chillness Fear. Herbert, my sleep
                  Hath been as soft and balmy, as young babes
                  Inherit from their blessed innocence,
                  Or hardy peasants win with honest toil.
                  When I awoke thy slumbers were perturbed,
                  Unquiet.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Vexed, my liege, with dreams.
               
               
                  King.
                  Of what?
               
               
                  Herb.
                  So please you, Sire, demand not.
               
               
                  King.
                  Dost thou think
                  A dream can vex me now? Speak.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Thrice I slept,
                  And thrice I woke,and thrice the self-same vision
                  Haunted my fancy. Seemed this very room,
                  This dim and waning taper, this dark couch,
                  Beneath whose crimson canopy reclined
                  A form august and stately. The pale ray
                  Of the watch-light dwelt upon his face, and showed
                  His paler lineaments, where majesty 
                  And manly beauty,and deep trenching thought,
                  And Care the wrinkler, all were blended now
                  Into one calm and holy pensiveness,
                  Softened by slumber. I stood gazing on him
                  With weeping love, as one awake; when sudden
                  A thick and palpable darkness fell around,
                  A blindness, and dull groans and piercing shrieks
                  A moment echoed; then they ceased, and light 
                  Burst forth and musick—light such as the flood
                  Of day-spring at the dawning, rosy, sparkling,
                  An insupportable brightness—and i'th' midst,
                  Over the couch, a milk-white dove, which soared 
                  Right upward, cleaving with its train of light
                  The Heavens like a star. The couch remained
                  Vacant.
               
               
                  King.
                  Oh that the spirit so may pass!
                  So rise! Thrice did'st thou say?
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Three times the vision
                  Passed o'er my fancy.
               
               
                  King.
                  A thrice-blessed omen! 
                  
                  
                  
                     Herbert, my soul is full of serious joy,
                  Content and peaceful as the Autumn sun,
                  When, smiling for awhile on the ripe sheaves
                  And kissing the brown woods, he bids the world
                  A calm goodnight. Bear witness that I die
                  In charity with all men; and take thou, 
                  My kind and faithful servant, follower
                  Of my evil fortunes, true and tender, take 
                  All that thy master hath to give—his thanks,
                  His poor but honest thanks. Another King
                  Shall better pay thee. Weep not. Seek the
                        Bishop;
                  And if thou meet with that fair constancy, 
                  My mournful Henrietta, strive to turn
                  Her steps away till—I'm a coward yet,
                  And fear her, lest she come to plunge my thoughts
                  In the deep fountain of her sad fond tears,
                  To win me—Ha! can that impatient foot,
                  That hurrying hand, which shakes the door—
               
               Enter the Queen.
               
                  Queen.
                  My Charles!
               
               
                  King.
                  Haste to the Bishop.
               
               Exit Herbert.
               
                  Queen.
                  Charles!
               
               
                  King.
                  Already here!
                  Thou did'st fall trembling in my arms, last night,
                  Dizzy and faint and spent, as the tired martlet,
                  Midway her voyage, drops panting on the deck,
                  And slumbers through the tempest. I kissed off
                  The tears that hung on those fair eyelids, blessing
                  Thy speechless weariness, thy weeping love
                  That sobbed itself to rest. Never did mother
                  Watching her fevered infant pray for sleep 
                  So calm, so deep, so long, as I besought 
                  Of Heaven for thee when half unconscious, yet
                  Moaning and plaining like a dove, they bore thee
                  With gentle force away. And thou art here
                  Already! wakened into sense and life 
                  And the day's agony.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Here! I have been
                  To Harrison, to
                        Marten, to Lord
                        Fairfax, 
                  To Downes, to Ireton,— even at Bradshaw's feet
                  I've knelt to day. Sleep now? shall I e'er sleep 
                  Again!
               
               
                  King.
                  At Bradshaw's feet! Oh perfect love
                  How can I chide thee? Yet I would thou had'st spared
                  Thyself and me that scorn.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Do Hunters scorn
                  The shrill cries of the lioness, whose cubs
                  They've snared, although the Forest-Queen approach
                  Crouching? Do seamen scorn the forked lightning
                  Albeit the storm-cloud weep? They strove to soothe; 
                  They spake of pity; one of hope.
               
               
                  King.
                  Alas!
                  All thy life long the torturer hope hath been
                  Thy master!—Yet if she can steal an hour
                  From grief—whom dost thou trust?
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Thyself and Heaven 
                  And a relenting woman. Wrap thyself
                  Close in my cloak—Here! here!—to Lady Fairfax!
                  She's faithful; she'll conceal thee. Take the cloak;
                  Waste not a point of time, not whilst the grain of sand 
                  Runs in the glass. Dost fear its shortness? See
                  How long it is! 
                  
                  
                  
                  On with the cloak. Begone!
               
               
                  King.
                  And thou?
               
               
                  Queen.
                  My post is here.
               
               
                  King.
                  To perish
               
               
                  Queen.
                  No,
                  To live to a blest old age with thee in freedom.
                  Away my Charles, my
                     King! I shall be safe—
                  And if I were not could I live if thou—
                  Charles, thou wilt madden me. 'Tis the first boon
                  I ever craved;and now, by our young loves,
                  By our commingled griefs, a mighty spell,
                  Our smiling children and this bleeding land,
                  Go! I conjure thee, go!
               
               
                  King.
                  I cannot.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     King
                  
                  Begone! or I will speak such truth—and truth 
                  Is a foul treason in this land—will rain
                  Such curses on them, as shall force them to send me
                  To the scaffold at thy side. Fly!
               
               
                  Charles.
                  Dost thou see 
                  Fierce soldiers crowded round, as if to watch 
                  A garrisoned fort, rather than one unarmed
                  Defenceless man, and think'st thou I could win 
                  A step unchallenged? Nor though to escape 
                  Were easy as to breathe, the vigilant guard
                  Smitten with sudden blindness, the unnumbered
                  And stirring swarms of this vast city locked
                  In charmed sleep, and darkness over all
                  Blacker than starless night, spectral and dim
                  As an eclipse at noontide, though the gates
                  Opened before me,and my feet were swift
                  As the Antelope's, not then if it but perilled
                  A single hair of friend or foe would I
                  Pass o'er the threshold. In my cause too much
                  Of blood hath fallen. Let mine seal all. I go
                  To death as to a bridal; thou thyself
                  In thy young beauty was not welcomer
                  Than he. Farewell, beloved wife! My chosen!
                  My dear- one! We have loved as peasants
                  
                  
                  Been fond and true as theyNow fare thee well!
                  I thank thee,and I bless thee. Pray for me,
                  My Henrietta.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Charles, thou shalt be saved. 
                  Talk not of parting. I'll to Fairfax; he 
                  Gave hope, and hope is life.
               
               
                  Charles.
                  Farewell!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  That word—
                  I prythee speak it not—withers me, lives 
                  Like a serpent's hiss within mine ear, shouts through
                  My veins like poison, twines and coils about me
                  Clinging and killing. 'Tis a sound accurst,
                  A word of death and doom. Why shouldst thou speak it?
                  Thou shalt be saved; Fairfax shall save thee. Charles,
                  Give me a ringlet of thy hair—No, no—
                  Not now! Not now!Thou shalt not die.
               
               
                  King.
                  Sweet wife,
                  Say to my children that my last fond thought—
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Last! Thou shalt live to tell them of thy thoughts
                  Longer than they or I to hear thee. Harken
                  Promise thou wilt await me here! Let none— 
                  They will not dare, they shall not. I but waste
                  The hour. To Fairfax,
                     the good Fairfax! Charles
                  
                  Thou shalt not die
               
               (Exit Queen.)
               
                  King.
                  Oh truest fondest woman! 
                  My matchless wife! The pang is mastered now,
                  I am Death's conqueror. My Faithfullest! 
                  My Fairest! My mostdear! I ne'er shall see 
                  Those radiant looks again, or hear the sound
                  Of thy b voice, which was a hope, or feel
                  The thrilling pressure of thy hand, almost
                  A language, so the ardent spirit burned
                  And vibrated within thee! I'll to prayer,
                  And chase away that image! I'll to prayer,
                  And pray for thee, sweet wife! I'll to my prayers.
               
               Exit.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               —The Banquetting-House at Whitehall, glass folding-doors opening to the Scaffold, which is covered with black. The block, axe, &c. visible ; Officers and other persons are busy inthe background, and Cromwell is also there giving directions.
               
               
                  Har.
                  
                     Cromwell!—Good-morrow Ireton!Whither goes
                  The General?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  To see that all be ready
                  For this great deed.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  He hath the eager step,
                  The dark light in his eye, the upward look,
                  The flush upon his cheek, that I've marked in him
                  When marching to the battle.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Doth he not lead
                  To day in a great combat, a most holy
                  And glorious victory?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (at the back of the Stage)
                  Hast thou ta'en order
                  That soon as the head's off the 
                        Abbey bell
                  Begin to toll?
               
               
                  Officer.
                  I have.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Look that the axe
                  Be keen,and the hand steady. Let us have
                  No butchery.
                  (advancing to the front of the Stage.)
                  If he die not, we must perish—
                  That were as nothing! but with us will die
                  The liberty for which the blood of saints
                  And martyrs hath been spilt, freedom of act,
                  Of speech, of will, of faith! Better one grey 
                  Discrowned head should fall, albeit a thought
                  Before the time, than God's own people groan
                  In slavery forever.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Whoso doubteth
                  But he shall die?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Tis rumoured, Sirs, amongst ,
                  The soldiery, that one of a high place,
                  
                     Fairfax—But I believe
                     it not. Hast thou
                  The Warrant Hacker?
                  
               
               
                  Hack.
                  No.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Since when doth Fairfax
                  
                  Dare to impugn the sentence of a free 
                  And publick court, of England—
               
               
                  Har.
                  Of the Great
                  All-Righteous Judge who hath delivered him
                  Manifestly to us?
               
               
                  
                  Will he dare oppose 
                  
                     Armyand people? He alone!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Be sure
                  The good Lord-General, howsoe'er some scruple
                  May trouble him, will play a godly part
                  In this sad drama.—Aye, I have the Warrant!
                  It is addressed to thee. Thou must receive
                  The prisoner,and conduct him hither.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  Hath
                  The hour been yet resolved?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Not that I hear.
                  Enter Fairfax.
                  Ha! our great General! Well met my Lord!
                  We that are laden with this heavy burthen
                  Lacked your sustaining aid!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  
                     Cromwell, I too
                  Am heavy-laden.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  You look ill at ease;
                  'Tis this chill air, the nourisher of rheums,
                  The very fog of frost, that turns men's blood
                  To water.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  No, the grief is here. Regret,
                  Almost remorse, and doubt and fear of wrong
                  Press heavily upon me. Is this death
                  Lawful?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  His country's sentence, good my Lord, 
                  May be thy warrant.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  An anointed King!
               
               
                  Har.
                  A bloody tyrant.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Yet a man, whose doom 
                  Lies on our conscience. We might save the King
                  
                  Even now at the eleventh hour; we two 
                  Hold the nice scales of life and death, and shall not
                  Fair mercy sway the balance? Dost thou hear me?
                  Wilt thou not answer? Canst thou doubt our power?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No. Man hath always power for ill. I know
                  We might desert our friends, betray our country,
                  Abandon our great cause, and sell our souls
                  To Hell. We might do this,and more; might shroud
                  These devilish sins in holy names, and call them
                  Loyalty, Honour, Faith, Repentance—cheats
                  Which the great Tempter loves!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Yet harken,Cromwell!
                  Bethink thee of thy fame
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Talk'st thou of fame
                  To me? I am too mean a man, too lowly,
                  Too poor in state and name to need abjure
                  That princely sin, and for my humbleness
                  I duly render thanks. Were I as thou—
                  Beware the lust of fame, Lord
                        General,
                  Of perishable fame, vain breath of man,
                  Slight bubble, frailer than the ocean foam
                  Which from her prow the good ship in her course
                  Scattereth and passeth on regardlessly.
                  Lord General beware!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  I am Lord General;
                  And I alone by mine own voice have power
                  To stay this deed.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Alone?
               
               
                  Fair.
                  I'll answer it
                  Before the Council.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Ha! alone!—come nearer.
               
               
               
                  Fair.
                  What would'st thou of me?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Yonder men are firm
                  And honest in the cause, and brave as steel;
                  Yet are they zealots, blind and furious zealots! 
                  I would not they should hear us—bloody zealots!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Speak, Sir; we waste the hour.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I would confess
                  Relentings like thine own.—They hear us not?
               
               
                  Fair.
                  I joy to hear thee.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Thou art one elect,
                  A leader in the land, a chosen vessel,
                  And yet of such a mild and gracious mood,
                  That I, stern as I seem, may doff to thee
                  This smooth and governed mask of polity, 
                  And shew the struggling heart perplexed and grieved
                  In all its nakedness. Yes, I have known
                  The kindly natural love of man to man
                  His fellow!—the rough soldier's shuddering hate
                  Of violent death, save in the battle; lastly 
                  A passionate yearning for that sweetest power
                  Born of fair Mercy.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Yet but now thou chidd'st me
                  And with a lofty scorn for such 
                        
                     a weakness.
                  The change is sudden.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Good my lord, I strove 
                  And wrestled with each pitying thought as born
                  Of earthly pride and mortal sin. Full oft
                  We, that are watchers of our wretched selves,
                  Aiming at p
                     higher virtues, trample down
                  Fair shoots of charity and gentle love
                  Yet still my breast was troubled. and since thou
                  Art moved by such relentings—
               
               
                  Fair.
                  And a promise 
                  Made to my wife
               
               
                  Crom.
                  A wise and pious lady!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Thou wilt then save the King?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir,  we must have 
                  Some higher warrantry than our wild will,
                  Our treacherous human will, afore we change
                  The fiat of a nation. Thou art a man
                  Elect and godly—Harrison!—go seek 
                  The presence of the Lord. Perhaps to thee
                  A guiding answer, a divine impulsion,
                  May be vouchsafed. Go with him Harrison! 
                  Seek ye the Lord together.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  'Tis a wise
                  And pious counsel.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Step apart awhile;
                  We will await ye here.
                  Exeunt FairfaxandHarrison. 
                  
                     Cromwell gives
                           the Warrant to Hacker.)
                  Now! now! be quick! 
                  (Exit Hacker.)
                  Is the scaffold all prepared? The headsman waiting
                  With shrouded visage and bare arm? The axe 
                  Whetted? Be ready on the instant. Where
                  Be guards to line the room, mute wondering faces,
                  A living tapestry, and men of place 
                  To witness this great deed? A King should fall
                  Decked with the pageantries of Death, the clouds
                  That roll around the setting sun.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  If Fairfax
                  
                  Return before he come—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Dost thou mistrust
                  
                     Harrison's gift in
                     prayer? The General's safe. 
                  Besides I sent erewhile the Halberdiers
                  To guard Charles
                        Stuart hither. Hacker'll
                     meet
                  His prisoner.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  But should Fairfax—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Wherefore waste
                  A word on such a waverer!
               
               
                  Ire.
                  What hath swayed him?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  His wife! his wife! The Queen hath seen again
                  That haughty dame, and her fond tears—
               
               
                  Ire.
                  I marvel
                  That thou endur'st that popish witch of
                        France
                  
                  So near.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I watch her. He must die! 'Tis borne
                  Upon my soul as what shall be. The race,
                  The name shall perish.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Aye, the very name
                  Of King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Of Stuart.
                  
               
               
                  Ire.
                  And of King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  So be it.
                  Will Bradshaw never come?
                  
                     Bradshaw, Cook, Marten, and others.
                  Ah welcome! welcome!
                  Ye are late.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Yon living mass is hard to pierce
                  By men of civil calling. The armed soldiers
                  Can scantly force a passage for their prisoner.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  He comes?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  He's at the gate.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  What say the people?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  The most are pale and silent, as a Fear
                  Hung its dull shadow over them; whilst some
                  Struck with a sudden pity weep and wonder 
                  What ails them; and a few bold tongues are loud
                  In execration.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  And the soldiers?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  They
                  Are true to the good cause.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The righteous cause!
                  My friends and comrades ye are come to witness
                  The mighty consummation. See, the sun
                  Breaks forth! The Heavens look down upon our work
                  Smiling! The Lord hath risen!
               
               
                  Ire.
                  The King!
               
               Enter the King, Hacker,
                     Herbert, a Bishop, Guards, &c.
               
                  King.
                  Why pause ye?
                  Come on.
               
               
                  Herbert gives the
                        King a letter.
               
                  Herb.
                  Sire, from thy Son.
               
               
                  King.
                  My boy! My boy!
                  No; no; this letter is of life, and I 
                  And life have shaken hands. My kingly boy!
                  And the fair girl! I thought to have done with this.
                  But it so clings! Take back the letter,Herbert.
                  Take it, I say. Forgive me, faithful Herbert,
                  That last impatient word. Forgive me. Now, Sirs,
                  What see ye on that platform? I am as one
                  Bent on a far and perilous voyage, who seeks
                  To hear what rocks beset his path. What see ye?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Only the black-masked headsman.
               
               
                  King.
                  Aye, he wears 
                  His mask upon his face, an honest mask.
                  What see ye more?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Nought save the living sea
                  Of human faces, blent into one mass
                  Of sentient various life: woman and man, 
                  Childhood and infancy,and youth and age,

                  King.
                  I shall look upward.
                  Why pause we here?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye, why?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  May it please thee, Sir,
                  To rest awhile? Bring wine.
               
               
                  King.
                  I need it not. 
                  Yes! fill the cup! fill high the sparkling cup!
                  This is a holiday to loyal breasts,
                  The King's accession day. Fill high! fill high!
                  The block, the scaffold, the  swift sudden axe,
                  Have yet a privilege beyond the slow
                  And painful dying bed, and I may quaff 
                  In my full pride of strength a health to him,
                  Whom, pass one short half-hour, the funeral knell
                  Proclaims my successor.  Health to my son!
                  Health to the King of England! Start ye, Sirs,
                  To hear the word? Health to King Charles,and peace,
                  To this fair realm! And when that blessed time
                  Of rightful rule shall come, say that I left
                  For the bold traitors that condemned, the cowards
                  Whonot opposing murdered me(I have won
                  So near the Throne of Truth that
                     true words spring
                  Unbidden from my lips,) say that I left
                  A pardon, liberal as the air, to all,
                  A free and
                        
                      royal pardon!—Prythee speed me
                  On my rough journey.

                  I thank thee, Sir. My good Lord Bishop,
                  Beware the step.—

                  It were not meet that earthly loves should mingle
                  With yonder dying prayer. Yes! Still he kneels.
                  
                     Hacker come hither. If thou see a stir
                  Amongst the crowd, send for my horse; they're ready;—

            SCENE II.
            Another Gallery in Whitehall.
            Enter Cromwell.
            
               Crom.
               Methought I heard her here.—No!—if she win 
               To Fairfax!—he must die, as Ahab erst
               Or Rehoboam, or as that great heathen
               Whom Brutus loved and slew. None ever called
               
                  Brutus a murderer! And
                     Charles had trial—
               'Twas more than Caesar had!—free open trial,
               If he had pleaded. But the Eternal Wrath
               Stiffened him in his pride. It was ordained,
               And I but an impassive instrument 
               In the Almighty hand, an arrow chosen
               From out the sheaf. If I should reign hereafter 
               Men shall not call me bloody.—Hark! the bell!
               No—all is hush as midnight.—I shall be 
               Tenderer of English lives. Have they forgot
               To sound the bell? He must be dead.
            
            
               Queen.
               (without)
               
                  Lord Fairfax!
            
            
               Crom.
               The Queen! the Queen!
            
            Enter the Queen
            
            
               Queen.
               They told me he was here— 
               I see him not,—but I have wept me blind;—
               And then that axe, that keen, bright, edgy axe,
               Which flashed across my eyeballs, blinding me
               More than a sea of tears.—Here's one!: — Oh fly
               If thou be man, and bid the headsman stay
               His blow for one short hour, one little hour,
               Till I have found Lord Fairfax! Thou shalt
                  have 
               Gold, mines of gold! Oh save him! Save the King!
            
            
               Crom.
               Peace! peace! Have comfort!
            
            
               Queen.
               Comfort! and he dies,
               They murder him; the axe falls on his neck;
               The blood comes plashing;—Comfort!
            
            Enter Lady
               Fairfax
            
            
               Lady F.
               Out alas!
               I can hear nought of Fairfax, royal Madam!—
               
                  Cromwell, the Master-murderer!
            
            
               Queen.
               Oh forgive her!
               She knows not what she says. If thou be Cromwell
               
               Thou hast the power to rescue: See I kneel;
               I kiss thy feet. Oh save him! Take the crown;
               Take all but his dear life! Oh save him, save him!
               And I will be thy slave!—I, a born Princess,
               I, a crowned Queen, will be thy slave.
            
            
               Crom.
               Arise!
               My Lady Fairfax lead this frantic
                  woman
               To where her children bide.
            
            
               Queen.
               Thou wilt not make
               My children fatherless? Oh mercy! Mercy!
               I have a girl, a weeping innocent girl,
               That never learnt to smile, and she shall be
               Thy handmaid; she shall tend thy daughters. I,
               That was so proud, offer my fairest child 
               To be thy bondwoman.
            
            
               Crom.
               Raise her! Undo
               These clasping hands. I marvel,Lady
                  Fairfax,
               Thou canst endure to see a creature kneel
               To one create.
            
            
               Lady F.
               Out on thee,hypocrite!
               Where lags my husband?
            
            
               Queen.
               Save him, save him,Cromwell!
               
            
            
               Crom.
               Woman arise! Will this long agony
               Endure forever?
               Enter Ireton, on one side,
                  followed by Fairfax and Harrison on the other.
               Is he dead?
            
            
               Fair.
               What means
               This piercing outcry?
            
            
               Queen.
               
                  Fairfax! He is saved!
               He is saved!
            
            
               Ire.
               The bell! the Abbey bell! Hark!
            
            
               Crom.
               There
               The will of Heaven spake. The King is dead.
            
            
               Fair.
               Look to the Queen. Cromwell, this bloody
                  work
               Is thine.
            
            
               Crom.
               This work is mine. For yon sad dame,
               She shall away to France. This
                  deed is mine,
               And I will answer it. The Commonwealth
               Is firmly 'stablished Ireton. Harrison,
               The Saints shall rule in Israel. My Lord General,
               The army is thine own, and I a soldier,
               A lowly follower in the cause.
                  This deed
               
               Is mine.—

               SCENE I.
               
                  St. Mark's Place.
               
                  Count Erizzo and Celso meeting Donato.
               
                  Don.
                  Good morrow Count Erizzo, you are early. 
                  Are you bound to the Palace?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Aye, Donato,
                  The common destination; but I go
                  With an old friend.
               
               
                  Don.
                  What, Celso, thou turned courtier!
               
               
                  Cel.
                  I am a suitor to his Highness, Sir, 
                  With Count Erizzo's aid.
               
               
                  Don.
                  What is your suit?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  One of the procuratorsThe Procurator of St. Mark's was the second-most prestigious lifetime office in the Republic of Venice (the most prestigious was that of the Doge). died last night;
                  And honest Celsohere would fain succeed
                  To that good office.
               
               
                  Don.
                  None more capable!
                  You will not fail.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Scarcely, I think;---and yet
                  I hardly know. The old Doge likes me not:
                  There have been murmurs in the Senate, cousin,
                  At these long wasting wars; and he, I hear,
                  Suspects me. I have doubts. From you, indeed,
                  One word--
               
               
                  Don.
                  It shall be said. Give me the paper.
                  Yes, at one word from me---theDoge and I
                  Are friends, old friends, the friends of forty years;
                  Besides we have a pair of hopeful sons,
                  Friends from the cradle upwards.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  And those friends
                  May soon be brothers. Will not thy Camilla
                  
                  Be Foscari's bride, when his rough mistress War
                  Shall loose him from her arms?
               
               
                  Don.
                  Aye; he'll return
                  Too soon,, whene'er he comes, to steal away
                  My age's darling. Yet is he a boy
                  Full of high thoughts, a noble princely boy,
                  Kindly and generous; one that may deserve
                  Even her.---Well, give me this petition,Count.
                  Look on the post as certain.
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Cel.
                  How can I
                  Repay---He's gone. Think'st thou he will succeed?
                  
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  I know not. Either way works well for us.
                  If he succeed, then will our party gain
                   firmer foot in Venice; if he fail,
                  We gain Donato.
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Say'st thou so?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  I know him.
                  He's of a temper kind, and quick, and warm;
                  A powerful partizan, but easily sway'd
                  By flattery or anger. Of such tools
                  Are Faction's ranks composed, not officered.
                  
                     Celso, we'll have this Dogeunbonneted,
                  This Doge who wears his load of four-score years
                  Easier than I my forty. He contemns
                  Me and my brother nobles: he may learn
                  To know and fear our power. I tell you, Sir,
                  These brows of mine do ache for that same bonnet,
                  
                  And ere this day be ended---
               
               
                  Cel.
                  'Tis, my Lord,
                  A golden moment. The young Foscari
                  
                  Is safe with Sforza in the Milan wars.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Would I were sure of that! This is indeed
                  The only moment. Celso, I have here,
                  How intercepted boots not, letters from
                  
                     Both generals to the Senate. They have gained
                  A signal victory; Brescia is freed;
                  And Sforza gives the unshared unmingled praise
                  To Foscari. We must unthrone the Doge
                  
                  Ere this news reach the citycity; for the people
                  Adore the Foscari. Faugh! I am weary
                  Of this good Doge, this venerable Doge,
                  This popular Doge, this Doge who courts and
                        wooes
                        woos
                     
                  
                  The noisy rabble, whilst the Senators
                  
                  He elbows from their seats. And for the son,
                  With his hot 
                        valour
                        valor
                     and proud lack of pride---
                  I hate them both. We must not lose an hour---
                  The people must not hear---
               
               
                  Cel.
                  The Senate hates them.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Aye, but the Senate---
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Well, my Lord, the Senate--
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Fy! I am one of them; I must not tell
                  The secrets of the Council. We are not
                  So stubborn as we seem; the popular voice
                  Finds there an echo; and besides the Doge
                  
                  Hath friends. Here comes one.
                  Enter Count Zeno.
                  A fair morning to you
                  
                     Count Zeno. I have scarcely seen you since
                  Your lingering sickness.You look cheerily.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  The air of this new day is sweet and freshening,
                  And breathes a health into the veins. I trust
                  You need no renovating; yet to step
                  From a sick bed and a dark silent room
                  Into the pure and balmy air of June,
                  With the bright sunlighting so blue a sky,
                  And sparkling on the waterswaters all around,
                  Full of the living noise of trade or mirth,
                  Air, earth, and sea all motion---it is like
                  Returning from the tomb to this fair world
                  Of life and sunshine! Such delight is well
                  Worth a sharp fever.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Nevertheless am I
                  Content with your report. A homelier joy
                  Suffices me.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  You are the happier man.
                  Are you for the palace?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  No. We wait a friend.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Then I must say good morrow. I am somewhat
                  In haste to-day.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Good morrow,Count.
                  Exit Zeno.
                  That man
                  Wears in his courtly smile the consciousness
                  Of his high influence---the prime 
                        favourite
                        favorite
                      he!
                  Did you not see how graciously he stooped
                  To me his equal, even as he had been
                  Himself a prince---proud minion!---Doge, beware!
                  Beware!--- Look, look, Donato too hath found
                  A check?See how he chafes! See!
               
               Enter Donato.
               
                  Don.
                  Take thy paper!
                  I am refused. Good morrow!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Nay, come back.
                  Can this be possible? Refused! Donato
                  
                  Refused by Foscari!
               
               
                  Don.
                  I was a fool
                  To ask;---a double fool to pin my faith
                  Upon this Doge's ermine.
               
               
                  Celso.
                  I regret
                  More than my failure the indignity---
               
               
                  Don.
                  Forget it, Sir.---How go these Milanwars?---
                  I say, Erizzo, could'st thou have believed
                  The proudest he in Venice would have dared
                  To treat me with such scorn?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  What! did he scorn thee?
               
               
                  Don.
                  He chid me, schooled me, blamed my easy temper,
                  That lent an ear to every cunning tale,
                  A voice to every false designing knave.
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Dared he!
               
               
                  Don.
                  And this to me! Why art thou not
                  Amazed,Erizzo?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  No. It but confirms
                  What I have heard and scarce believed. The Doge
                  
                  Is grown so old that he forgets his friends.
                  Men say---it can't be true---and yet men say---
               
               
                  Don.
                  What?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  That the Doge repents his son's betrothment
                  To thy Camilla.
               
               
                  Don.
                  He shall never wed her.
                  Sir, if this Doge were king of all the earth
                  He might have found a higher, prouder title
                  In father to Camilla! They are free.
                  
                     Camilla's claims shall never interrupt---
                  What is his project?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Our great enemy,
                   The Duke of Milan, hath a young, fair daughter,
                  And she, they say---
               
               
                  Don.
                  Tush! I have seen her, man!
                  A dark browed wench, a beetle-browed,---no more
                  To match with my Camilla than that Gondola
                  With the Bucentaur!The Bucentaur was a large, stately barge used by the Doge of Venice when performing the annual Marriage of the Sea ceremony. A gondola, by contrast, is a small flat-bottomed Venetian boat.---I will backand tell him
                  That Foscari
                      is free. Mine own Camilla!
                  My prattling, pretty one! I'll back and tell him.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  No; rather come with me. What I have said
                  Is hearsay or conjecture; what is true
                  Is the misgovernment, the public wrongs
                  Of this old Foscari, too old to sway
                  The power of Venice. This is not a place
                  For such discourse. Come with me to my palace.
               
               
                  Don.
                  I thought he loved my daughter!
               
               
                  Cel.
                   Thou art sure.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               An Apartment in the Ducal Palace.
               The DogeandCount Zeno.
               
                  Zeno.
                  Good morrow to your Highness.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Dearest Zeno,
                  This is no common pleasure. Thou the latest
                  Of our late revellers, whom the sun scarce sees
                  Till half his course be run---
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Oh! good my Lord,
                  I meet him often ere I go to bed,
                  The bright reproachful tell-tale!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  To see thee,
                  But lately risen from a sharp sickness too,
                  Afoot so early! There must be some cause,
                  Some kind or pleasant cause---What brings thee,Count?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  This letter!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  No petition for the post
                  Vacant by poor Venoni's death?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Oh!no.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I should have grieved within one little hour
                  To say twice No to two dear friends. You met
                  
                     Donato?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Yes, so chafed he saw me not.
                  Your Highness knows his temper.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  And I fear
                  Tried it too much. He asked of me that office
                  For a known villain, an unusual compound
                  Of ruffian and of knave, the follower
                  Of his kinsmankinsman Count Erizzo.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Then the Count
                  
                  Was waiting for Donato. I am grieved
                  He should be so companioned.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  He flung from me
                  Ere I could tell him that the post was given
                  To Signor Loredano, a ripe scholar
                  Pining in penury, at the pressing instance
                  Of his own son.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  
                     Cosmmo! How like is that
                  To his unwearied kindness.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  There is not,
                  Unless I may except my Foscari,
                  A youth in Venice who can vie in aught
                  With Cosmo.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  And they are as different
                  As the bright sun and and gentle moon, the sea
                  In sparkling motion and the quiet land.
                  The one a stirring,braveand honest soldier,
                  The other a pale student.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Bless them both
                  
                  My noble boys! They have always loved like brothers,
                  And soon I hope my pretty sweet Camilla
                  
                  Will give them that dear title.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Have you had
                  Tidings of Foscari lately?
               
               
                  Dage.
                  Not for long,
                  Longer than common.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Last night at St. Mark's
                  There was a rumour floating--none could trace
                  Its source---of a great victory obtained
                  By Foscari and Sforza.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Heaven grant it!
                  
                  Sure we shall hear to day.--Now dearest Count, 
                  What is your will? You led the old man on
                  To talk of his dear children, till in sooth
                  He had forgotten the whole world. Now say
                  What is that scroll?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  My lord---I almost fear---
                  Dost thou believe in soothsayers?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  No!--Yes!--
                  Not much.Why dost thou ask?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Wilt thou not answer?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  
                     Count Zeno, thou art one to whom, being wise,
                  A wise man may confess the cherished folly
                  That lurks within his breast. But tell it not
                  To fools, good Zeno.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Then thou dost believe?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I have some cause. What! didst thou never hear
                  Of the old prediction that was verified
                  When I became the Doge?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  An old prediction!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Some seventy years ago--it seems to me
                  As fresh as yesterday--being then a lad
                  No higher than my hand, idle as an heir,
                  And all made up of gay and truant sports,
                  I flew a kite unmatched in shape or size
                  Over the river--we were at our house
                  
                  Upon the Brenta then; it soared aloft
                  Driven by light vigorous breezes from the sea,
                  Soared buoyantly, till the diminished toy
                  Grew smaller than the falcon when she stoops
                  To dart upon her prey. I sent for cord,
                  Servant on servanthurrying, till the kite
                  Shrank to the size of a beetle: still I called
                  For cord, andand sent to summon father, mother,
                  My little sisters, my old halting nurse,--
                  I would have had the whole world to survey
                  Me and my wondrous kite. It still soared on,
                  And I stood bending back in extasy,
                  My eyes on that small point, clapping my hands,
                  And shouting, and half envying it the flight
                  That made it a companion of the stars,
                  When close beside me a deep voice exclaimed--
                  Aye, mount! mount! mount!--I started back, and saw
                  A tall and aged woman, one of the wild
                  Peculiar people whom wild Hungary sends
                  Roving through every land. She drew her cloak
                  About her, turned her black eyes up to Heaven,
                  And thus pursued:--Aye, like his fortunes,mount,
                  The future Doge of Venice! And before
                  For very wonder any one could speak
                  She disappeared.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Strange! Hast thou never seen
                  That woman since?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I never saw her more.
                  After a slight brief search, the wonder sank
                  Into a jest. My mother for a while
                  Called me her pretty Doge, her madcap Doge,
                  And rang a thousand fondling changes through
                  On that proud title; and my sisters long
                  Talked of the tall Hungarian. None believed
                  But my old nurse.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  And thou?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Long time in me
                  The seeds of faith lay dormant; till at last
                  As youth's gay wildness sobered, and ambition
                  Grew stronger in my soul, the prophecy
                  Knocked at my thoughts, and I by fits believed
                  That which I wished were true. Now for thy scroll;--
                  Whence comes it?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Even such an aged crone,
                  So tall, so habited, stayed me last night
                  At my own door, and with an earnest voice,
                  Her shaking hand prest on my arm, implored
                  That, as I loved the good Doge Foscari,
                  I would at his first waking give him this.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  She must be dead! Full seventy years ago--
                  And then her locks were grizzled!--She is dead.
                  And what, at fourscore years, have I to do
                  With fate or fortune! My long race is run.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Read it at least.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  (reads.)
                  
                     "The ducal bonnet trembles on thy brow, Doge of Venice,trembles--and will fall, though the stars themselves shew me not when. Grant the first boon that shall be asked of thee to-morrow, or before the next sun rises thy very heart shall be rent in twain."
                  
                  Grant the first boon! Why, my good Signor Celso,
                  This is too palpable. Grant the first boon!
                  Make thee the Procurator! Fy! Fy! Fy!
                  
                     Erizzo's talent hath forsaken him;
                  This cheat is shallow. They have heard the tale
                  I told thee, and this paltry poor device--
                  Off to the waves and winds!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Yet hath the count
                  
                  A party in the state; and for Donato,
                  Kind, hasty, generous and beloved, his power
                  May vie with thine.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  But never will be used
                  Against me,Zeno. I should hate myself
                  Could I suspect Donato. Count,we'll go
                  Together to the Senate. Thou shalt see 
                  The quick relenting of his sudden wrath,
                  His graceful self-rebuke, his honest love.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  I'll gladly be converted.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Doubt him not.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENE III.
               An Apartment in the Donato Palace.
               
               
                  CamillaandLaura.
               
                  Camilla.
                  
                     Laura, hast thou seen Cosmo?
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Not to day.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Sure he'll not cheat us of his early smiles,
                  His gay good-morrow, that best joy of home
                  When dear friends meet in morning cheerfulness.
               
               
                  Lau.
                  And such a cheerfulness! and such a smile!
                  None are like his.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  None! Hast thou never seen
                  The heaven of kindness that in Foscari's eyes
                  Shines under those dark brows? And I'm the sister
                  Of that dear Cosmo, the selected bride
                  Of that still dearer Foscari! Oh, cousin
                  I am the blessedest creature that e'er trod
                  This laughing earth! There is but only one
                  Can hope to be so happy;--thou, perchance
                  When Cosmo--
                  Enter Cosmo.
                  We were speaking of thee.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Well,
                  I trust fair maids. My gentle lady Laura,
                  Say yes to that.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Feed not man's vanity;
                  Let not thy blushes answer.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Sister mine,
                  'Tis thou art clothed in blushes. Why the dawn
                  Opening her ardent eyes, and shaking wide
                  Her golden locks on the Adriatic wave,
                  The bright Aurora, she is sad and pale
                  And spiritless compared to thee. Hast thou
                  Been Psyche's errand?An allusion to the four tasks imposed upon the mythological Psyche by her lover Cupid's mother, Venus, in Lucius Apuleius' Metamorphoses.Or hath some fair vision
                  Lapt thee in loveliness?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  I think I dreamt
                  Of heaven; for I was in a place where care
                  And fear and sorrowcame not, self-sustained
                  On wings such as the limner's cunning lends A limner is a painter of portraits.
                  
                  To the Seraphim, andsinging like a bird
                  From the deep gladness of a merry heart
                  The whole night long. And when the morning came
                  And I awakened in this work-day world,
                  The spell was on me still; and still is on
                  The buoyancy, the joy, the certain hope
                  Of happiness. Brother, are there no news
                  
                  Of Foscari?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  None certain. Yet is there
                  A balmyness of hope; and stirring rumours
                  Come pattering round us, with a pleasant sound,
                  Like the large drops before a summer shower.
                  They talk of Foscari and victory--
               
               
                  Cam.
                  There hath then been a battle. Is he safe?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  As safe as I myself.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Fy! what a fool
                  Am I to tremble so! And art thou sure?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  There is no certainty, but such a hope
                  As is her forerunner. Hath not my father
                  Heard of this victory?
               
               
                  Lau.
                  He hath been long 
                  Gone to the palace, and wished you to follow.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Gladly. I have a good man's gratitude
                  To pay to the good Doge. I must away
                  Or I shall miss the Senate.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Thou wilt send
                  The tidings,Cosmo?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Surely.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Quickly?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Good tidings,Cosmo.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Yes. My pretty cousin
                  Hast thou no charge to give?
               
               
                  Lau.
                  Why bring this tale,
                  This happy tale thyself.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Aye come thyself
                  Dear Cosmo, and farewell.
                  Exit Cosmo.
                  NowLauramine
                  Let us to the high balcony. I need
                  Fresh air and sun and sparkling sights and sounds
                  To help sustain this happiness, this hope,
                  Which weighs almost like fear. My dearest, come.

                  Count Erizzo, Donato andSenators.
               
                  Eriz.
                  He rules us as a king--this Foscari,
                  An absolute king,haughty and imbecile
                  As any Eastern sovereign! He degrades
                  The old Nobility, contemns the Senate,
                  And cringes to the people--a mob courtier!
                  A greedy swallower of popular praise!
               
               
                  Sen.
                  He hates the Nobles.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  But this very day
                  Did he refuse to my dear kinsman here
                  A post, that he requested for a man
                  Who long hath served the state.
               
               
                  Sen.
                  Refuse Donato!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Even so. He is of the Senate, is the head
                  Of an old powerful house, is rich, is noble,
                  Is nobly loved. Are not these crimes enough
                  To stir our Doge's wrath?
               
               
                  Don.
                  No more of this!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Then his misgovernment, his tedious wars,
                  His waste of blood and treasure, that his son,
                  That idol of the soldiery, may glut
                  His lust of glorious battle! Senators,
                  Why should we thus submit to what we hate?
                  Why bow to whom we made? The Doge is now
                  Too old for his high office. Good my lords,
                  Let us resume our power. Is there no brow
                  In Venice that may bear this ducal crown
                  Save one? Will it not sit as gracefully
                  On vigorous manhood's clustering curls? On thine,
                  
                     Donato? Or, Pisani, upon thine?
                  Or any man of us? Lords, have ye changed
                  Your purpose? That the Doge may be deposed
                  Is the fixed law of Venice. Are ye firm?
                  This is the moment.
               
               
                  Sen.
                  He must be unthroned.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Then be it done to-day.
               
               
                  2nd Sen.
                  I'll join thee,Count.
               
               
                  3rd Sen.
                  And I.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  
                     Donato, thou wilt best propose--
               
               
                  Don.
                  Oh no! He hath been harsh--but I have loved him--
                  We are old friends.
               
               
                  Sen.
                  Do it thyself,Erizzo.
               
               
                  Don.
                  But gently, reverently.
                  Enter Doge, Count Zeno,and other
								Senators.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My gracious lords
                  
                  I greet ye well!We are no truants, sirs,
                  This full assemblage honours our fair Venice,
                  Honours her senators.Signor Donato--
                  Nay shun me not--That post was promised to--
                  Thou wilt not hear! I have too often borne
                  With thy infirmity. Forget not, sir,
                  That thou'rt my friend, or I must needs remember
                  That I'm thy prince. Now to our business, lords.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Are there no letters from the army?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  None.
                  But there is through the city a loud bruit
                  Of victory.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  In a well ordered state
                  There is no pause for rumour; certainty
                  Outspeeds her lying rival.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Think'st thou, count,
                  That my old heart is quiet in this pause?
                  Thou hast no boy in yonder battle field,
                  Or thou would'st know how thirstily the soul
                  Of a father pants in his suspense for truth,
                  One single drop of sweet or bitter truth.
                  Enter Cosmo.
                  Who's that?
               
               
                  Sen.
                  
                     Cosmo Donato, please you, Sir.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Oh our young Secretary! Sit by me,
                  I had just missed thee,Cosmo. Was thy friend
                  Content?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Oh never gratitude was clothed
                  In such pure joy. I would your Highness saw
                  The happiness you caused.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Hush! Count Erizzo,
                  You were about to speak.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  I was;and yet
                  I gladly would delay, gladly resign
                  A painful duty.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  If it touch me, Sir,
                  Speak.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Is there not,my lord, a law in Venice,
                  That if the Doge, by sickness, grief, or age,
                  Become incapable, he be removed?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  There is. Say on.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  What need I to say more!
                  Know we not all the good Doge Foscari
                  
                  Is turned of fourscore years? Fitter for him
                  To lay down the proud bonnet, which doth weigh
                  So heavily on those white hairs, and pass
                  In calm serene repose the evening hours
                  Of his unsullied life. So shall his sun,
                  Setting in tranquil beauty, leave a train
                  Of pure and cloudless light; so praised and loved
                  Shall he sink down to rest.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  This is not all.
                  On, on, my lord!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Fitter for us a man
                  Who shall remember in this state of Venice
                  
                  There is another power great as himself,
                  And greater than the people. Howsoe'er
                  Thou hast the bearing, Doge, of a born prince,--
                  To us thy subjects, thou art but the head
                  Of the Venetian nobles. Thy proud rank
                  Was given by them, thy equals. Each great name
                  That now surrounds thee hath in turn adorned
                  Thy splendid office. Not a noble house
                  But is a link in the resplendent chain
                  Of old Venetian story. We are born
                  Lords of the Adriatic; not a name
                  But hath been vowed her spouse. Think not such namessuch names
                  Are common sounds; they have a music in them,
                  An odorous recollection, they are part
                  Of the old glorious past. Their country knows
                  And loves the lofty echo which gives back
                  The memory of the buried great; and we
                  Their sons--Oh our own names are watchwords to us
                  That call to valour and to victory,
                  To goodnessand to freedom. This hast thou
                  Forgotten. Every creeping artisan,
                  Every hard-handed smoky slave is nearer
                  To our great Doge than we: to them all smiles
                  And princely graciousness--to us all frowns
                  And kingly pride. Fitter for us a Doge
                  Of a congenial spirit, to preside
                  Over our councils, and to guard and guide
                  The Senateand the State.
                  
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Perhaps Erizzo 
                  Would deign to wear this care-encompassed crown? 
                  Fy! Fy!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  My voice is for Donato, Sir!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  My father Doge of Venice? Never! Never! 
                  He will not, must not, shall not. All the world 
                  Would join in one reproach; the very stones 
                  Of Venice would cry out; and we, his children--- 
                  Oh we should die of grief and shame! What he 
                  Supplant his friend, his dearest friend? Oh never! 
                  Father, thou wilt not?
               
               
                  Sen.
                  Silence!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Signor Cosmo 
                  Thou art not yet a Senator.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  My lords, 
                  I pray your pardon; but if I had seen 
                  A venomed serpent coiling round his limbs 
                  And pressing him within its deadly clasp, 
                  Would ye have blamed the cry that Nature sent?--- 
                  Thou wilt not be the Doge?
               
               
                  Don.
                  Never!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  My father 
                  Forgive me that I feared. How could I fear! 
                  Forgive me.
               
               
                  Doge.
                   Noble boy!---Hast thou said all? 
                  That I am old, and that I love the people?
                  
                  Are these my crimes? Oh I am doubly guilty! 
                  I love them all, even ye that love me not! 
                  I cannot chuse but love ye, for ye are 
                  Venetians, quick, and proud, and sparkling eyed, 
                  Venetians, brave and free. Ye are the lords 
                  Of the bright sea-built city, beautiful 
                  As storied Athens; or the gorgeous pride 
                  Of Rome, eternal Rome; greater than kings 
                  Are ye Venetian nobles---ye are free; 
                  And that is greatness and nobility, 
                  The source and end of power. That I have made 
                  Liberty common as the common air, 
                  The sun-light, or the rippling waves that wash 
                  Our walls; that every citizen hath been 
                  Free as a Senator; that I have ruled 
                  In our fair Venice, as a father rules 
                  In his dear household, nothing intermitting 
                  Of needful discipline, but quenching fear 
                  In an indulgent kindness; these ye call 
                  My crimes. They are my boasts. Yes, I do love 
                  The honest artizans; there's not a face 
                  That smiles up at me with a kindly eye 
                  But sends a warmth into my heart, a glow 
                   Of buoyant youthfulness. Age doth not freeze 
                  Our human sympathies; the sap fails not 
                  Although the trunk be rugged. Age can feel, 
                  And think, and act. Oh noble Senators, 
                  Ye do mistake my crime. I am too young; 
                  I am not like to die; and they who wait 
                  Wax weary for my seat. I do not dote, 
                  My lord Erizzo; Yet--- 
                  Shouts without.)
                  Foscari! Foscari!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  What mean those shouts?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Francesco Foscari!
                  
                  There lives no other, whom a grateful people 
                  Would greet as with one heart.
                  Enter Foscari.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  My Lord Francesco!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My son, my very son! Now I am young 
                  And great and happy! Now I reign again, 
                  My noblest son!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Father! Why this is joy 
                  Deeper than victory! Dost feel my heart?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Art thou unhurt?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Untouched. I almost shame 
                  To want one glorious scar. How well he is! 
                  What fire is in his eyes! Cosmo, thou too!--- 
                  But I have tidings that the Doge must hear 
                  Upon his throne. High tidings, gracious lords! 
                   My father,---take thy state.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  (aside)
                  Lost! lost! All lost! 
                  Another hour and that most hated boy 
                  Had been most welcome!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  (to Cosmo)
                  Still as lovely, Cosmo? 
                  And still as true?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Yes! Yes!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Will not the Doge 
                  Assume the accustomed seat?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My son, these lords, 
                  These Senators, these mighty ones of Venice 
                  Have found thy father old. Hadst thou returned 
                  Some half hour later, thou hadst seen the throne 
                  Filled by Donato, or his cousin Count. 
                  Which hath thy voice, Francesco?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Thou not Doge! 
                  Erizzo climb into thy honoured seat, 
                  Honoured by thee! Or thou, Donato, thou
                  
                  Join with this false, ungrateful, heartless senate, 
                  This shadow and this mockery of wisdom, 
                  To cast aside the best and truest heart 
                  That ever made our Venice rich and proud 
                  And great and happy, to throw off thy Prince 
                  Like an old garment! Shame! Thou that didst call 
                  Thyself his friend! Shame! shame! My dearest Cosmo, 
                   This was a grief to thee. Oh shame! shame! shame!
               
               
                  Don.
                  Rated again, and by a boy! I tell thee 
                  I would not be the Doge.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  My Lord Francesco, 
                  Thy tidings.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Take thy state, Doge Foscari. 
                  From thee did I receive my maiden sword, 
                  From thee my high commission; to none other 
                  Will I resign them. Senators of Venice! 
                  Ingrates! I bring ye victory and peace. 
                  Victorious peace! Brescia is free, and Milan 
                  Sues at your feet for peace. Her haughty Duke 
                  Is Sforza's prisoner,---my prisoner, Doge, 
                  And Sforza weds his heir.
               
               
                  Don.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  (giving letters to the Doge)
                  Eight days hence 
                  He will be here. See what he writes, my lord. 
                  The Senate is amazed; yet from the field 
                  We sent ye somewhat of this glorious tale.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Those letters reached not Venice.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Count Erizzo, 
                  I met the messenger, and staid my horse 
                  To ask him of my father. He had stopt 
                  Short of the palace, but had safely given 
                  The packet to a Senator. Erizzo, 
                   Thou wast the man. Look at him, ye that ever 
                  Saw guilt ooze out in shame! Nay, tremble not;
                  
                  I pardon thee. There is no other vengeance 
                  For low dishonour. It would stain my sword 
                  To dip it in thy blood.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  My Lord Francesco, 
                  I yet may find a time---
               
               
                  Fos.
                  I pardon thee.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Sforza says here, this Brescian victory 
                  Was gained by thee. Zeno, read there---just there.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Here is the treaty, Doge; already signed 
                  By Milan, Sforza, and myself: add thou 
                  Thy venerable name, Doge Foscari. 
                  So---having crowned a long and glorious reign 
                  With glorious peace, let me, thy son, pluck off 
                  This envied bonnet from thy honoured head. 
                  Wear it the worthiest! Never will it clip 
                  Within its golden circlet such high thoughts, 
                  Such a brave love of freedom, such a warm 
                  And generous faith in man. Proud lords of Venice, 
                  Ye ne'er deserved him. My good sword, lie there! 
                  I am no more your general. Pass we forth 
                  Together, my dear Father, private men--- 
                  Rich in the only wealth the world can give, 
                  A spotless name.
               
               
                  Doge.
                   Richest in thee. Nay, Zeno!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Ye must not leave us, lords. Doge, if again 
                  We had to chuse, our choice again would fall 
                  On Foscari. Is't not so?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  (apart to a Sen.)
                  Sail with the stream--- 
                  Foscari!---I'll find a time---
               
               
                  Senators.
                  Foscari! Foscari!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  One still is silent.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Now, my Father, now! 
                  For thy fame's sake.
               
               
                  Don.
                  On Foscari.
                  
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Thanks! thanks! 
                  Now dare I look upon that reverend face, 
                  And grasp this hand again.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Did we not know thee!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Senators, countrymen, at your behest 
                  I wear once more the crown.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh, no! no! no! 
                  Bear not again that burthen.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My Francesco, 
                  Take up thy sword again, thy knightly sword--- 
                  I am too proud of thee!---thy stainless sword! 
                  Now, good my lords, our fellow-citizens 
                  Must be made happy in this glorious tale. 
                  First to proclaim the peace; then, with meek hearts, 
                   Lowlily, with a steadfast thankfulness 
                  Pour out our homage to the Lord of Peace 
                  In his own temple. This high duty o'er, 
                  I bid ye to the palace; we must grace 
                  Our soldier with some revelry. Donato, 
                  Thou wilt be there, and Cosmo---will ye not? 
                  And our Camilla, lady of the feast, 
                  And of the heart. Come to us, dear Donato.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  (apart to Don.)
                  Are all his taunts forgotten?
               
               
                  Don.
                  No! I cannot.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Think better of it, Zeno!---Follow soon, 
                  Francesco!---Zeno, is this storm the end 
                  Of our dark prophecy?
                  Exeunt Doge, Zeno & Senators.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Signor Donato, 
                  I have a feeling here of deep old love 
                  That tells me I have wronged-thee. If I have, 
                  Forgive me!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Father, canst thou turn away 
                  When Foscari speaks those words which mortal ear 
                  Ne'er heard him utter?
                  
               
               
                  Fos.
                  If I did mistake, 
                  'Twas in my Father's cause; 'twas such a wrong 
                  As Cosmo would have done for thee. Forgive me, 
                  For her dear sake.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  (to Don.)
                  Remember, "Shame!"
               
               
                  Don.
                   Erizzo, 
                  Think'st thou I can forget! Not even for her. 
                  Stay me not, Cosmo.
                  Exit Donato.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Go, for I can trust 
                  Thy kind heart, Father! Love, who is so strong 
                  In gentleness. Love and his bondman Time 
                  Will conquer anger. We must now submit. 
                  To-morrow---
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh! what a long life of love 
                  Must I give up! To-morrow! I am here, 
                  Here in this happy Venice, which she makes 
                  The palace of her beauty, where the air 
                  Is sweetened by her breath, and her young voice 
                  Floats on the breeze like music. I am here--- 
                  Divided from her but by envious walls, 
                  Clouds that conceal my sun. Had'st thou but seen 
                  How I urged on my mettled courser's speed, 
                  My matchless Barbary horse, till his pure jet 
                  Was pounced with snowy flakes; or how I strove 
                  To graft my hot impatience on the dull 
                  And sluggish boatmen: or with what a stroke 
                  I cleft the water; or how leapt ashore---
               
               
                  Cos.
                  I can believe 't---
               
               
                  Fos.
                  That I might sooner gain 
                  By one half hour her presence! And to bear 
                   This longing till to-morrow! Thou must say 
                  All this and more, much more, of love and hope 
                  And fond impatience. Tell her---
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Thou thyself
                  
                  Shalt tell her these sweet things, mixed with a world 
                  Of lovers' eloquence, of looks and sighs, 
                  And broken words. Aye, Foscari, thou thyself!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  But how? Where? When?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  To night. For one short hour 
                  Steal from the feast its hero. My good father, 
                  Who, like a bird, fore-runs the summer sun, 
                  Seeks his nest early. Thou mayst ask for me 
                  And find Camilla.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Blessings on thee, friend!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  To night!
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  We have a hearer.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  He is gone.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Beware that smooth Erizzo, dearest Cosmo, 
                  Beware!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Nay, Foscari, let me caution thee 
                  Beware suspicion! Think him innocent 
                  Till thou hast proved him guilty. Blackening doubt 
                  Beseems not thy clear breast. Sweep it away.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh, how I love the beautiful mistakes 
                  Of thy unbounded charity! That man--- 
                   Didst thou not see him whispering Donato? 
                  We will not think of him. Doth my Camilla 
                  Talk of me often?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh, I was sure! 
                  But it is such a joy to hear that yes! 
                  Doth she---
                  Shouts without.)
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Hark! thou art called. The citizens 
                  Demand their General. Go!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  I'd rather face 
                  An enemy in battle.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Thou wast wont 
                  To love the people, Foscari.
               
               
               
                  Fos.
                  I would drain 
                  The last drop in my veins for them and freedom; 
                  But these loud shouts, this popular acclaim, 
                  This withering, perishing blast of vulgar praise, 
                  Whose noisy echoes do shake off the flush 
                  Of Fame's young blossoms---Oh, I hate them all! 
                  True honour should be silent, spotless, bright, 
                  Enduring; trembling even at the breath 
                  That wooes her beauty.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Come.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               A Room in the Erizzo Palace.
               Count Erizzo entering.
               
                  Eriz.
                  Seek Signor Celso.---Baffled, spurned, contemned, 
                  Pardoned---the insolent! But he shall feel--- 
                  All lost! For old Donato, shallow fool, 
                  Hath in his anger a relenting spirit 
                  And will yield easy way at the first tear 
                  The fair Camilla sheds---the very first! 
                  She hath but to cry Father, and to hang 
                  About his neck and his light wrath will melt 
                  Like snowflakes in that rain. How the dull Senate 
                  Cowered at the haughty soldier's feet! Even I--- 
                  Thinks he I too can pardon! He shall find 
                  My hate immortal. Nothing stands between 
                  Me and the crown but Foscari. To-night--- 
                  This Celso, as I have good cause to know, 
                  Can wield a dagger well---to-night he goes 
                  To meet his lady love---to-night---alone--- 
                  I can detain young Cosmo.
                  
                  Enter Celso.
                  Celso, friend, 
                  Thou comest at a wish. Where hast thou been?
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Where I am stunned with shouts of Foscari, 
                  And dazzled with the glare of tinselled gauds 
                  Hung out to honour him. The palaces 
                  Are clothed with tissues, velvets, cloths of gold 
                  And richer tapestry. The canals all strewed 
                   With floating flowers, through which dark gondolas 
                  Dart as through some bright garden. All is lost, 
                  And I must leave dear Venice. Count, farewell!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Why must thou go?
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Ask my hard creditors.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Celso, I have a thousand ducats here 
                  For him that rids me of a clinging plague.
               
               
                  Cel.
                  A thousand ducats!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Hast thou still thy dagger? 
                  In, and I'll tell thee more. This very night!
               
               Exeunt.
               END OF ACT THE SECOND.
               
            
         
         
            ACT III.
            
               SCENE I.
               An Apartment in the Donato Palace.
               Donato, Camilla and Laura.
               
                  Laura.
                  Camilla, why so drooping?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  This hath been 
                  A long and weary day; there is a heat, 
                  A gloom, a heavy closeness. See, this rose 
                  Is withering too, that was so fresh and fair--- 
                  The white musk-rose---that which he used to love.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  It was no day for Venice. 'Twould have been 
                  A calm sweet stillness in our country home, 
                  Bowered amid green leaves and growing flowers, 
                  With fragrant airs about us, and soft light, 
                  And rustling birds.
               
               
                  Don.
                  The sky portends a storm. 
                  To bed, Camilla!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Father! dearest father, 
                  Have I displeased thee?
               
               
                  Don.
                  No! To bed! To bed! 
                  Laura, good night.
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  He used to call me child, 
                  His dearest child; and when I grasped his hand 
                  Would hold me from him with a long fond gaze,
                  
                  And stroke my hair and kiss my brow, and bid 
                  Heaven bless his sweet Camilla! And to night 
                  Nought but to bed! to bed!
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Believe it, Cousin, 
                   A thing of accident.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  And Cosmo comes not; 
                  He sends not to me---he that never broke 
                  His plighted word before! And Laura! Laura! 
                  Foscari is in Venice, is returned 
                  Triumphant, and he comes not, sends not, Laura! 
                  And when I ask of him my father frowns 
                  Sternly on his poor child.
                  Re-enter Donato.
               
               
                  Don.
                  My pretty-one, 
                  I could not go to rest, till I had said 
                  Heaven bless thee!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  My dear father!
               
               
                  Don.
                  What is this? 
                  A tear?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Oh! gratitude and love and joy 
                  Are in that tear, dear father!---and one doubt--- 
                  One fear---
               
               
                  Don.
                  Sweetest, good night!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Foscari, father?
               
               
                  Don.
                  To bed my own Camilla!
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Not a word.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Something works in him deeply.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Yet how kind, 
                  How exquisitely fond! Cosmo must know, 
                  And, Laura, Cosmo never flies from thee, 
                   And thou may'st ask---
               
               
                  Laura.
                  I will, I will, sweet Coz! 
                  Look, dearest, at the glancing gondolas
                  
                  Shooting along, each with its little light, 
                  Like stars upon the water. Whither go they?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  To the proud Ducal Palace, where they hold 
                  High feasting in his honour. There the dance, 
                  And the quaint masque, and music's softer strains 
                  Minister to his praises.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  And the ear 
                  That would drink in so eagerly that sweet praise, 
                  The heart that would leap up at every sound 
                  Rejoicing, the glad eyes---Would thou wert there!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Ah! would I were, since Foscari is there; 
                  That is enough for me! Where'er he is, 
                  In tent or battle-field---Hark! what is that? 
                  That music? Oh 'tis he! 'tis Foscari! 
                  Dost thou not know the strain, the wandering strain, 
                  Trembling and floating like a spirit's song, 
                  With many a---Hark again!---'Tis he! 'tis he! 
                  That air belongs to him even as a name 
                  It thrills my very heart. Am I not pale?
               
               
                  Laura.
                  No; the bright blood floats trembling in thy cheek, 
                  Most like that wandering music.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  There is pain 
                   In this excess of joy.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  He comes.
                  Enter Foscari.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Camilla! 
                  Sweetest Camilla!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Thou art come at last 
                  Francesco!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  My Camilla---Come at last! 
                  Why this is chiding! Can'st thou chide, Camilla?
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Aye, or she were no woman.
                  
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Lady Laura! 
                  Forgive me that I saw you not. Camilla, 
                  Chide on---nay thou art smiling---Come begin! 
                  I'd rather hear thy chidings than the praise 
                  Of all the world beside. Let me but hear 
                  Thy voice, whate'er thou speakest.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Dear Francesco, 
                  Thou hast been long away.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh very long!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  And where?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Away from thee. That is enough; 
                  Where thou art not I keep no count of place 
                  Nor time, nor speech, nor act.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Yet tell me where.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Where I have dreamt of courts and camps and fields 
                  Of glorious battle. A long weary dream 
                   To him, who loves to bask him in thy smiles, 
                  And live upon thy words.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Yet hast thou lost 
                  Ten weary hours to-day.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Why this, indeed, 
                  Is chiding, my Camilla. I have been 
                  At the Palace, at the Senate hall, at Church, 
                  Have undergone a grand procession, love, 
                  And a long dreary feast.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  And is that all?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  And is not that enough? Would'st thou crowd in 
                  More tediousness? Oh thou unmerciful!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  But why not first---sure he is thinner, Laura, 
                  Thinner and paler?
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Nay, he is the same.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Why not first come to me?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Perhaps I love 
                  
                  To visit my heart's treasure by that light 
                  When misers seek their buried hoards; to steal 
                  Upon the loved one, like a mermaid's song, 
                  Unseen and floating between sea and sky; 
                  To creep upon her in love's loveliest hour, 
                  Not in her daylight beauty with the glare 
                  Of the bright sun around her, but thus pure 
                  And white and delicate, under the cool moon 
                   Or lamp of alabaster. Thus I love 
                  To think of thee, Camilla; thus with flowers 
                  About thee and fresh air, and such a light, 
                  And such a stillness; thus I dream of thee, 
                  Sleeping or waking.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Dost thou dream of me?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Do I! without that lovely mockery, 
                  That sweet unreal joy, how could I live 
                  When we are parted? Do I dream of thee! 
                  Dearest, what ails thee? Thou art not to night 
                  As thou art wont, thine eyes avoid my gaze, 
                  Thy white hand trembles and turns cold in mine. 
                  What ails thee, dearest? Hast thou heard---What fear 
                  Disturbs thee thus, Camilla?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  I will tell thee. 
                  Cosmo is absent; my dear father grieved; 
                  There is high feasting in thy princely home 
                  And I not there; and thou not here till now, 
                  At midnight, when my father sleeps, and Cosmo 
                  Is still away. Are ye all friends? Say Foscari 
                  The very truth.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Well! Thou shalt hear the truth. 
                  Cheer thee! 'Tis nought to weep for. At the Senate 
                  There were to-day some hasty words.---Erizzo, 
                  Thy subtle kinsman, he was most to blame--- 
                   I was too hot, too rash; but I implored 
                  
                  Donato's pardon, and am half forgiven; 
                  Though yielding to the crafty Count, he shunned 
                  To sup with us to-night.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Ah! I had feared---
               
               
                  Fos.
                  There is no cause for fear. This sudden storm 
                  Is but a July shower that sweeps away 
                  The o'erblown roses. Cosmo is our friend, 
                  Our truest warmest friend; and well thou know'st 
                  Thy father's kindly heart; he loves thee so; 
                  Aye, and he loves me too; and he shall love me 
                  Better than ever.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  He shall love! Lord Foscari 
                  Thou'rt a true soldier. Wilt thou conquer love?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Surely.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  And how?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  By love, and gratitude, 
                  And deep respect, and true observance, Laura. 
                  Shake not thy head, Camilla. He shall love me. 
                  What is he not thy father! Smile on me. 
                  Think'st thou that if I feared to lose thee I 
                  Should be thus tranquil?
                  Exit Laura.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  No. But at my heart 
                  There is a heavy sense of coming pain, 
                  A deep and sad foreboding.
               
               
                  Fos.
                   Thou hast been 
                  Vexed to-day, sweetest, and thy weary thoughts 
                  Tinge the bright future with the gloomy past.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Well, be it so. And yet I would to heaven 
                  That this one night were over!---Where is Laura?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  She glided off, with a kind parting smile, 
                  And a quick sparkle in her eye, that said 
                  Ye will not miss me!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Aye, her merry glance;
                  
                  But we do miss her. 'Twas a saucy thought, 
                  My pretty gentle Laura!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  She is grown.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Yes, tall and beautiful and rarely good. 
                  Oh 'tis the kindest heart! We think she'll make--- 
                  What is that noise?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Nothing. A distant door. 
                  What startles thee, Camilla?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  My own heart. 
                  Hark how it beats, painfully, fearfully! 
                  Hush! hush! Again that noise!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  'Tis thunder, love, 
                  And that hath stirred thy spirits. Cheer thee, dearest; 
                  A soldier's wife should be as brave as steel. 
                  What did'st thou say of Laura?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  She will make 
                   A sweet wife for our Cosmo.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  And doth he 
                  Love the young beauty?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  He hath scarce forgot 
                  To treat her as a child, the dearest child, 
                  The loveliest and the gentlest,---but a child. 
                  Francesco, thou must praise her---Ha! again! 
                  That is no thunder-clap. My father's door!--- 
                  Oh go! go! go!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  My dear Camilla, no! 
                  Thou can'st not fear me, I will be as calm, 
                  As humble---
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Go! go! go! I die with fear;--- 
                  He is so rash, so sudden;---He will kill thee!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Here! Under his own roof! In thy dear sight! 
                  Thy own dear father!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  He will part us, Foscari! 
                  Go!
                  
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Well, I go. But my Camilla---
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Go!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Dearest, farewell!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Not that way!---That! there! there! 
                  Leap from the window in the corridor, 
                  From the low balcony!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Farewell!
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Cam.
                   I'm glad 
                  That he is gone. Fear hath so mastered me 
                  I stumble on the level floor. Thank heaven 
                  They are both safe, my dearest Foscari, 
                  My dearest father! There's no danger now; 
                  And yet the night grows wilder. What a flash! 
                  And I have sent him forth into the storm, 
                  I, that so love him! I have sent him forth 
                  Into this awful storm! Protect him, Heaven! 
                  I thought I heard the window---Can those steps 
                  Be his?
               
               
                  Don.
                  (without)
                  Help! help! base traitor! Foscari! 
                  Murder!
                  Enter Laura.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  What's that?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Undo the door---I cannot--- 
                  Undo the door! My father!
                  Exeunt.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  (behind the scenes)
                  Who hath done 
                  This horrible deed?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  (behind the scenes)
                  My father! muder! murder!
               
               
            
            
               SCENE II.
               An illuminated Hall in the Ducal Palace.
               Doge, Count Zeno, Ladies and Gentlemen.
               
                  Doge.
                  Now for some stirring air to wake the spirits 
                  Of mirth and motion. Sweet ones, to the dance! 
                  Where is this Foscari? Gentles, in my youth 
                  He had been held a recreant that forsook 
                  The revel, and the light of ladies' eyes, 
                  And play of twinkling feet. Degenerate boy!
               
               
                  Gent.
                  Degenerate days! Ah! we could tell such tales 
                  Of the deep merriment, the gorgeous banquet, 
                  The high festivity of our old time! 
                  Thou may'st smile, Zeno, but his Highness knows 
                  Bright mirth is on the wane. Our puny sons 
                  Shew but faint flashes of their father's fire.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Believe him not, fair maids! 'Tis but the vaunt 
                  Of vaunting age. Believe him not. Why, Moro, 
                  Thy father in those mirthful days hath said 
                  The same to thee, and his to him; yet still 
                  'Tis merry Venice. Forty years to come 
                  We, too, may boast us of our jovial prime, 
                  Nor yet the world grow sadder. Fear it not. 
                  His Highness will not join thee, Signor Moro; 
                  He is too youthful-hearted.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  What a bribe 
                  Is that to aid thy cause! But Moro's right; 
                  We were fine gallants. Niece, I prythee see 
                   That all are welcomed. Where's thy sister Melfi?
               
               
                  2nd Gent.
                  Not yet returned from Rome.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I would have had 
                  
                  All the fair stars of Venice here to night 
                  Shining in one bright galaxy.
               
               
                  Gent.
                  We miss 
                  Signor Donato's daughter.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Aye, indeed, 
                  My pretty sweet Camilla!---Fair Olivia, 
                  Let Trevisano lead thee to the dance. 
                  Were I one ten years younger, trust me, Sir, 
                  I'd not resign this hand. Now a light measure. 
                  A Dance.
                  Is't not a peerless nymph? The youngest Grace 
                  Leading her linked sisters through the maze 
                  Of blossom'd myrtles upon Ida's side, 
                  Is not so light of foot. Rest thee, dear maid. 
                  What is that? Thunder?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Yes; a fearful storm. 
                  It rages awfully. Hark! there again!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Well; we must keep such coil of merriment 
                  As shall outroar the rattling storm. 
                  Enter Foscari.
                  Ah, truant! 
                  How wilt thou make thy peace?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  I read no war 
                  In these fair looks.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                   Peace is more perilous.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Aye, truly, Zeno.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Whither hast thou been? 
                  Watching her lattice but to catch a glimpse 
                  Of the swift slender shadow that glides past 
                  So gracefully, clouding the soft dim light?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Pooh! Pooh!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  And with a true devotion bent 
                  Uncovered at her shrine? Why thou art wet!
                  
                  This is some new device of gallantry, 
                  Some trick of Milan courtship.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Tush, man, tush! 
                  Ho! a brisk measure! Drown with merry notes 
                  Count Zeno's merry riddles! Wilt thou dance 
                  With me, dear lady? Do not say me No!
               
               
                  Lady.
                  Oh, no!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Why that should mean Oh yes!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Good niece, 
                  Will not the Lady Claudia join the dance? 
                  Seek her. I'm young and light enough to night 
                  To mingle there myself. What ails the music? 
                  Quicker! Why break they off? Dear Zeno ask.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Murdered! Impossible! I only left--- 
                  I am myself---It cannot be. Play on! 
                  On with the dance!
               
               
                  Gent.
                   Here is a man hath seen him, 
                  One who still shakes with fear.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Bring him to me! 
                  Where is he? Where?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Zeno, what is this tale?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  A tale of horror!
                  Enter Erizzo.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Justice, Doge of Venice! 
                  A Senator lies reeking in his blood, 
                  Murdered in his own palace. Justice, Doge!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  What Senator?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Canst thou ask that? Donato.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Donato murdered! the beloved Donato! 
                  The second name of Venice! Mine old friend! 
                  Lords, to the council. This is not a tale 
                  For woman's gentleness. Good night to all. 
                  Exeunt Ladies, and some Gentlemen.
                  
                  Would he had ta'en my hand!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  He is not dead--- 
                  It must be false, it shall be!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  What dost thou 
                  Doubt of Donato's death? Thou?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Hearken, Doge! 
                  His voice hath mockery in it, sharp and loud 
                  As the clear ring of metals: he speaks not 
                  As we, who heard the tale, in broken words 
                  And breathless; his teeth chatter not; his lips 
                   Are firm; there is no trembling in his limbs, 
                  No glare in his keen eyes. None but a fiend, 
                  Fresh from the reek of murder, could so master 
                  The human sympathy, the fellowship 
                  Of Nature and of kind.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Yet wherefore---
                  Enter Cosmo.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Justice!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Beloved friend!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Off! Off! I come for justice, 
                  For equal justice!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Thou shalt have it.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Doge! 
                  For equal justice!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Was he not my friend? 
                  Am I not thine?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Aye---so the murderer said!--- 
                  Friend! the word chokes me.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Grief hath turned his brain.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Thou shalt have justice.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  'Tis no midnight thief, 
                  No hired assassin, no poor petty villain;--- 
                  This is a fall, as of the morning star, 
                  
                  A death such as the first great slayer saw 
                  When Abel lay at his feet,---but I'll have justice! 
                  There be hearts here will crack, old valiant hearts 
                   When they shall hear this tale,---but I'll have justice!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Go some one call the guard. 
                  Exit Erizzo.
                  Name the assassin.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Have I not! Whither doth he fly!
               
               
                  Fos.

                  Thine! And the earth hears him 
                  And opens not her womb! The heavens hear 
                  And launch no thunderbolts! This work is mine. 
                  Hold firm my heart.---Cousin! Erizzo!
                  Enter Erizzo and Guard.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Seize 
                  Francesco Foscari. Nay stand not thus 
                  Gazing on one another. Seize him. Doge, 
                  He is the murderer.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Away with thee, 
                  Traitor and slanderer! He is my son--- 
                  Stir not a man of ye!---My son, the idol 
                  Of city and of camp. His life hath been 
                  One blaze of honour. Come to my old arms,--- 
                  Speak not a word---thy name is pledge enough 
                  My son!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Ye know your duty. Seize him, soldiers.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Approach me at your peril. Know you not 
                  This very morning how yon serpent lay 
                  Under my heel unbruised, a thing of scorn? 
                   Look not upon us, lords, with doubting eyes, 
                  Ye dare not doubt me---even to deny 
                  Is in some sort a stain!---My shield is bright. 
                  
                  Ye force me to these vaunts! I could not think 
                  A crime.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                   Bear hence the murderer. 
                  aside.)
                   Palsies wither 
                  The cowardly arm and plotting brain that feared 
                   To strike him dead at once! 
                  aloud)
                   Seize him, I say, 
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Now he that dares!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Francesco Foscari, 
                  I do arrest thee for this murder.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Thou! 
                  Come forth into the light! Off with those plumes! 
                  Look at me! Is this Cosmo? Hath some fiend 
                  Put on that shape? Speak to me!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Murderer!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  To-day he called me brother!---Deal with me 
                  Even as ye will.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Look to him, soldiers, well, 
                  That he escape not.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Sir, the Foscari 
                  Know not what that word means. I wait your pleasure.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Doge! Doth he hear me? Once I could have wept 
                  For such a grief, for him; now I am steeled 
                  By merciless misery, made pitiless 
                   By one that hath no pity. Look! he stands 
                  With such a calm of virtue on his brow, 
                  As if he would outface the all-seeing God 
                  With that proud seeming. Foscari, the dead 
                  Shall cry aloud in heaven, and I on earth, 
                  Till vengeance overtake thee. Doge of Venice, 
                  I call on thee for justice on thy son.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Father!---Oh, start not!---I am innocent. 
                  Hear that, and breathe again. Sir, I commit 
                  My life, my honour, the unsullied name 
                  
                  Of my great ancestors, of him the greatest 
                  My living father---even his name I trust 
                  To my just cause, and the just laws of Venice. 
                  I am your prisoner.
                  Exeunt Foscari, guarded, Erizzo and
								Cosmo.

                  Those lights! Those lights! 
                  They pierce my eye-balls, dart into my brain! 
                  If there be any pity left i' the world 
                  Make me a darkness and a silence, Zeno,

                  Senator.
                  Will the Doge preside?
               
               
                  2nd Senator.
                  He comes. 
                  How different from his step of yesterday! 
                  How hurried, yet how slow!
                  Enter Doge and Count Zeno.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Let me assist 
                  Your Highness.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  No.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  His robes encumber him; 
                  Support them.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Why will you torment me, Sir, 
                  With this officious care? These flowers are naught. 
                  Go bring me pungent herbs, hyssop and rue 
                  And rosemary; odours that keep in sense--- 
                  I have forgot my handkerchief.
                  
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Take this.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I am an old man newly stung with grief--- 
                  Thou hast forgiven me, Zeno? Are ye ready? 
                  Where is the accuser?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  May it please your Highness 
                  Call forth the prisoner.
                  Enter Foscari, guarded.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Oh not thou good Doge; 
                   Spare those white hairs!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Dare not to pity me! 
                  Sir, those white hairs are lichens on a rock. 
                  I tell ye, Sirs, since yesternight my blood 
                  Is dried up in my veins, my heart is turned 
                  To stone; but I am Doge of Venice still 
                  And know my office. Fear me not, Francesco! 
                  Francesco Foscari---Sir, is he there? 
                  My eyes are old and dim.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  I am here Father! 
                  Doge! I am here.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Francesco Foscari 
                  Thou art arraigned for the foul midnight murder 
                  Of the senator Donato. Art thou innocent? 
                  Or guilty?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Canst thou ask? The fresh-born babe 
                  That knows not yet the guiltiness of thought, 
                  Is not from such crime whiter.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Gracious heaven 
                  I thank thee! Now the weight is off my soul. 
                  I sinned in my black fear. Where's the accuser? 
                  Let him stand forth. Cosmo---Signor Donato, 
                  Speak.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Look with how calm and proud a mien 
                  
                  The murderer stands, whilst the poor son conceals 
                   His face against the wall.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Speak, pr'y thee, speak.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Alas! alas! I cannot. We were friends 
                  Even from earliest childhood. I loved him--- 
                  Oh how I loved him! Aye and he loved me, 
                  With a protecting love, the firmest love; 
                  For stronger, bolder, hardier, he to me 
                  Was as an elder brother. And his home 
                  Was mine, and mine was his---Oh he has sate 
                  A hundred times on that dear father's knee, 
                  His little head nestling against that breast, 
                  Where now---Oh Foscari, hadst thou slain me 
                  My last word had been pardon! But my father, 
                  And with a stedfast and unaltering cheek 
                  To listen---
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Cosmo! I am innocent. 
                  Yet, Heaven knows, I grieve---
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Camilla's father--- 
                  Poor, poor Camilla!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  (aside)
                  Ah thou hast it now! 
                  'Tis a fair woman's soft and liquid name 
                  That stings thy soul! Good, good.---Ho! Officer! 
                  Apart to an Officer, giving him a paper.
                  Deliver that and bring the witness hither, 
                  Look thou take no excuse.
                  Exit Officer.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Signor Donato, 
                   I pray you check these pardonable tears. 
                  Were this a place for passion, what's thy grief 
                  Measured with mine? The death of all thy name 
                  To this suspense, this agony, this shame, 
                  That eats away the soul? What is thy grief--- 
                  Master thyself, I say. Francesco Foscari 
                  
                  Stands there to answer to thy charge of murder. 
                  Produce thy proofs.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Bring in the corse. My Lord 
                  And ye, the equal judges, spare the son 
                  This miserable duty. I can tell, 
                  For I by chance was there, this tale of blood 
                  And mystery. The late unhappy feud 
                  Is known to all. Returning from St. Mark's 
                  With my young kinsman in his Gondola--- 
                  For I had missed of mine---we landed close 
                  To the Donato Palace, as the bell 
                  Was tolling midnight. 'Twas an awful storm; 
                  But by the flashing lightning we saw one 
                  Leap from the balcony---a Cavalier 
                  Splendid in dress and air. The lightning glared 
                  Full on his face and habit, unconcealed 
                  By hat or cloak, and instantly we knew 
                  Francesco Foscari.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Art sure of that?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                   Oh sure! Too sure!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  He passed so close Count Zeno, 
                  That my cloak brushed his vest; but sprang aside, 
                  As he had met an adder, and leaped down 
                  Into a waiting Gondola. I called, 
                  But Foscari answered not; and Cosmo spake, 
                  Betwixt a sigh and smile, of fair Camilla, 
                  Of their long loves, and of the morning's ire, 
                  And how he hoped this dark and sudden cloud 
                  Would speedily pass away. Even as he spake, 
                  Whilst loitering on the steps, we heard a shriek 
                  Within the house, so piercing, so prolonged, 
                  So born of bitter anguish---to this hour 
                  That shriek is ringing in mine ears! And when, 
                  
                  With trembling hearts and failing limbs, we scaled 
                  The stairs, we saw Donato bathed in blood, 
                  And poor Camilla lying on his breast, 
                  Her arms strained round his neck, as if she tried 
                  To keep in his dear life. 
                  The corse brought in.
                  The bloody witness 
                  Of this foul deed is here.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Poor good old man! 
                  This is a grievous sight.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Oh! Would to Heaven 
                  That I so lay, and so---I pray thee, on. 
                   Where are thy proofs?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  They shall come soon enough. 
                  Donato, rouse thee! Look upon those wounds! 
                  Think on the honoured dead!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  I dare not think, 
                  For thought is frenzy. Lords! The Count Erizzo 
                  Hath told ye how we found the corse. This sword, 
                  The well-known sword of Foscari, was plunged 
                  Deep in his gory breast; beside him lay 
                  This hat and cloak, the splendid soldier's garb 
                  Of Foscari; no man had approached the house 
                  Save only Foscari; and his last word, 
                  Mingled with cries of murder and of help, 
                  Was "Foscari." Is that sword thine? Disown it, 
                  And, against oath and proof and circumstance. 
                  Thy word---thy naked word---Disown that sword, 
                  And give me back the blessed faith that trusts 
                  In man my fellow! Look upon it well.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  'Tis mine.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  He's guilty. 'Twas the last faint hope 
                  On this side Heaven.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Cosmo! It is not his--- 
                  He knows not what he says---Give me the sword.
                  
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  'Tis mine; that which lay sheathed in victory 
                  Before ye yesterday; that which I bore 
                   Triumphing through the battle. What a blaze 
                  Streamed from the sparkling steel---how bright, how pure, 
                  How glorious, how like the light of Fame--- 
                  A wild and dazzling fire! Both, both are quenched. 
                  The sword is mine; but of this foulest deed 
                  I am as ignorant as the senseless blade.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Who heard Donato call on Foscari?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Doge, thou hast asked for proofs, for witnesses; 
                  I have one here. Officer, hast thou brought 
                  The lady?
               
               
                  Officer.
                  She attends.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Go lead her in.
                  Exit Officer.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  What lady? Sure thou canst not mean---
                  Enter Officer leading Camilla.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Camilla!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  She walks as in a heavy dream; her senses 
                  Are stupified by sorrow. Count Erizzo, 
                  Why dids't thou send for her? Why bring her here? 
                  Had we not breaking hearts enow before 
                  Without poor, poor Camilla?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She alone 
                  Heard his last dying words. Lady Camilla!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  She neither sees nor hears; she is herself 
                  A moving corse.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Camilla! Speak to her.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Sister! Heaven shield her senses! She is deaf 
                   Even to my voice. Dear sister!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Lead her towards 
                  The body. So! she sees it.
                  
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Father! Father! 
                  Have I found thee dear father? Let me sit 
                  Here at thy feet, and lean my aching head 
                  Against thy knee---Oh how it throbs!---and bury 
                  My face within thy cloak. What ails me, Father, 
                  That my heart flutters so? Feel here---He's cold! 
                  He's dead! He's dead!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Camilla!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Who art thou? 
                  Where am I? Wherefore have ye dragged me forth 
                  Into the glare of day---Oh cruel! cruel!--- 
                  Amongst strange men? Where am I? Foscari! Now 
                  I have a comforter. Have they not told thee 
                  That I am fatherless? Dost weep for me? 
                  For me?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Leave him; he is a murderer. 
                  Thy father's murderer!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Who dared say that? 
                  Francesco, speak to me!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Pollute her not! 
                  Touch not her garments! Fly his very sight--- 
                  He slew thy Father.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                   Ha! Again! Again! 
                  Cosmo, this man is false. Is he not Cosmo? 
                  Is he not all one falsehood? Answer me. 
                  I will kneel to thee, Cosmo, for a word, 
                  A sign. Press but my hand. He lets it fall!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Sister---I cannot tell her.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Thou thyself 
                  Art witness to his crime.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  I never knew 
                  Aught of him but his virtues.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Noble lady, 
                  Thou art before the assembled power of Venice, 
                  
                  Before thy father's corse, before high Heaven--- 
                  Answer me truly, lady---Didst thou hear 
                  Thy murdered father call on Foscari?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Ah!---He is innocent.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Didst thou not hear 
                  Foscari's name mixed with his dying shriek?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He's innocent! Oh I would stake my life 
                  On Foscari's innocence.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Beloved child:
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Ah! Art thou there? Release him; Set him free! 
                  Thou art the Doge, the mighty Doge of Venice, 
                  Thou hast the power to free him.---Save him now 
                  From my hard kinsman! Save him! I remember, 
                   When I was but a little child, I craved 
                  The grace of a poor galley slave, and thou 
                  Didst pardon him and set him free as air;--- 
                  Wilt thou not save thy son, and such a son, 
                  Who is as clear of this foul sin as thou? 
                  Cosmo, kneel with me!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  I have knelt for justice; 
                  And now again---
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  For mercy! mercy!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Answer! 
                  Demand her answer, Doge. She is a witness, 
                  Command her by thy power; thou art the Judge.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I am, I am. Ye should have Dukes of stone, 
                  But this is flesh. Camilla, I am not 
                  A King, who wears fair mercy on the cross 
                  Of his bright diadem; I have no power 
                  Save as the whetted axe to strike and slay, 
                  A will-less instrument of the iron law 
                  Of Venice. Daughter---Thou that should'st have been 
                  My daughter, we are martyrs at the stake, 
                  
                  And must endure. Shall we not copy him, 
                  Who stands there, with so brave a constancy, 
                  Patient, unfaltering? Let us chuse the right, 
                  And leave the event to Heaven. Speak, my dear child.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Heaven guide me then! Lords, I am here an orphan, 
                   The orphan of one day.---But yesternight--- 
                  Oh! did ye ever see a father die?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Calm thee my sister.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  And ye drag me hither--- 
                  Ye call me to bear witness---me, a woman; 
                  A wretched helpless woman!---Against him, 
                  Whom---ye are merciless---ye have no touch 
                  Of pity or of manhood! Do your worst; 
                  I will not answer ye.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Oh woman's love, 
                  Pure nurse of kind and charitable thoughts, 
                  Wiser than wisdom, instinct of the soul, 
                  How do I bless thee holiest love! Camilla, 
                  My brave and true Camilla, thou hast dropt 
                  Balm in the festering wound. Yet answer them. 
                  I cannot fear the truth. Ask her once more.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Were not the last words that Donato spake 
                  Foscari and murder?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Take her away; 
                  She hath confessed enough.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Oh no! no! no! 
                  Foscari is guiltless! Hear me!---He is guiltless!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Canst thou prove that? Thy sweet face always brought 
                  A comfort. Prove but that.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  (Aside.)
                   All curses on 
                  The coward Celso! He'll escape me yet. 
                  
                  Aloud.)
                  The facts? The proofs? The witnesses?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  His life; 
                  My heart, my bursting heart. If I had seen 
                  With these poor eyes that horror---had seen him 
                  Stabbing---Oh, thoughts like these may make me mad, 
                  But all the powers of earth and hell can never 
                  Shake my true faith! Foscari! I will share 
                  Thy fate, will die with thee, will be thy bride 
                  Even in that fatal hour, and pass away 
                  With thee to Heaven---So! so!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  She sinks; she sinks; 
                  Her strength is over-wrought. Oh die not yet 
                  Till I may die with thee! Awake, revive, 
                  My plighted love! The bridal hour will soon 
                  Unite us my Camilla. Help! she faints.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Fold her not thus within thy arms! Resign her!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  To thee! While still this arm hath marrow in it! 
                  To thee! Cosmo---thou---thou---Be tender of her, 
                  Be very tender---'tis a broken flower--- 
                  And pardon her her love. Take her. The pain 
                  Of death is over now. Proceed, my lords.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Let me support her, Cosmo. Thou dost stagger 
                  Under her slender form.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                   He spake to me, 
                  He gazed on me---I felt the long sad look 
                  Dwell on my face---he, at whose crime my soul 
                  Shudders, he spake---and I---men would have thought 
                  I was the guilty one! He bade me love 
                  This dearest, wretchedest. Tell him---No! no! 
                  Not even a last word.
               
               Exeunt Cosmo and Zeno, with Camilla.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  This hapless maid 
                  Hath owned enough. Foscari, wilt thou confess 
                  The murder?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  I am innocent.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Confess; 
                  Or we must force confession. To the rack!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Never whilst I have life! Am I not still 
                  The Doge of Venice? Rather stretch these stiff 
                  And withered limbs upon thy engines, Count! 
                  Rather crack these old joints! I thought that I 
                  Was steeled against all strokes---but this---
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  The rack!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Bethink thee of the Roman fathers, Doge, 
                  Of Brutus and of Manlius; thy son 
                  Will not disgrace thee. Come, the rack, the rack! 
                  I will front pain as a brave enemy, 
                  And rush to the encounter. What is the sense 
                  Of bodily agony to that which I 
                   Endure even now? Disgrace, suspicion, scorn, 
                  Hatred and haughty pity, and that last 
                  Worst pang---her love, her misery. These are tortures! 
                  Let me have something that a warrior's soul 
                  May strive against and conquer. Come, the rack!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Never.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  I must not hear thee, Doge. The question!
                  Re-enter Cosmo and Zeno.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Stop, on your lives! Forbear this cruelty, 
                  This cowardly cruelty! He will endure--- 
                  He will call up the courage of the field 
                  And die before he groans. His eye surveys 
                  That engine steadily, whose very sight 
                  Makes my flesh creep. Remove it. Oh to see 
                  
                  That butchery---and the old man---the poor old man! 
                  Remove it.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Well. Proceed we then to sentence.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  First listen to the prisoner. Foscari! speak.
               
               
                  Senator.
                  Yes; let us hear his tale. Defend thyself.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  To ye who doubt! To ye who disbelieve! 
                  Sir, there are spirits that can never stoop 
                  To falsehood; not for wealth, or power, or fame, 
                  Or life, or dearer love. Oh, were ye cast 
                  In the old chivalrous mould, pure diamond souls 
                  On which the dim polluting touch of doubt 
                  Rests not a breathing time! Were ye built up 
                   Of honour---But to ye---Why should I speak 
                  When I have nothing but my knightly word 
                  To prove me innocent?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  You are well paid 
                  By this contempt, Count Zeno. Now to judgment.
                  The Doge, Zeno, Erizzo, and the Senators retire
								to the back of the stage, leaving Cosmo and Foscari in the
								front.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Father! He passes on and doth not speak; 
                  He cannot; he has no words,---nothing but tears. 
                  Oh, what must the grief be that forces tears 
                  From his proud heart---his proud and bursting heart! 
                  The flame of youth burnt in him yesterday 
                  At fourscore years; to-day hath made him old. 
                  What groan was that? What other wretch? Donato! 
                  Cosmo! Wilt thou not answer?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Oh that voice 
                  Which was such perfect music,---which seemed made 
                  For truth and thought, fit organ, how it jars 
                  My very soul! What would'st thou?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  I would thank thee 
                  
                  That thou hast spared one pang to a brave heart. 
                  That rack---To have seen me stretched there, to direct 
                  Each fresh progressive torture.---He had died 
                  Before our eyes! I thank thee, sir. No more. 
                  Unless a dying man, for I am sentenced--- 
                  Look how he sinks his head upon his clenched 
                  And withered hands! I am condemned, and we 
                   Shall meet no more. Thou wilt not join the headsman 
                  To see the axe fall on my neck, nor follow 
                  The shouting multitude who, yesterday, 
                  Hail'd me a god, and, with like shouts, to-morrow 
                  Will drag me to the block. We meet no more; 
                  And as a dying man I fain would part 
                  In charity. We were friends, Cosmo.---
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Friends! 
                  I sinned in listening; but whilst he spake 
                  A world of kindly thoughts, a gush of the deep 
                  Old passionate love came o'er my heart---Forgive me 
                  Oh blessed shade! Friends! Why thy crime were common 
                  Wanting that damning dye---a simple murder! 
                  What though of one kind, noble, generous, 
                  Whose princely spirit scattered happiness 
                  As the sun light---a single sin! But 'twas 
                  My father, mine---avenging angel hear!--- 
                  Mine, that so loved thee.---
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  That, at the first glance 
                  Of wild suspicion, the first crafty word 
                  Of treacherous hate, doubted, accused, condemned--- 
                  Chasing through shameful trial to shameful death--- 
                  Yet daring to call down the wrath of God 
                  On a false friend! Oh cunning self-deceit! 
                  Oh wondrous cheat of blind mortality! 
                  
                   Thus doth the Evil Spirit cast about 
                  To win a soul from heaven. They come. They come. 
                  Now gentle death. 
                  The Doge, Erizzo, Zeno, and Senators
								advance.
                  Speak! I can better bear 
                  Thy words than that long gaze of agony. 
                  I am prepared.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Oh why did I resume 
                  This bonnet, which thy filial hand had plucked 
                  From my old brow, this fatal coronet, 
                  Predoomed to fall, that scorches me like fire--- 
                  Stings me like twisted serpents! Would I were 
                  A naked slave, chained to his weary oar, 
                  A worm that hath no sense but sufferance, 
                  Any thing vilest and most miserable, 
                  Rather than Doge of Venice! I must plunge 
                  A dagger in thy breast. Francesco Foscari, 
                  The council doth pronounce thee guilty.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  It works. It works.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Thou said'st thou wast prepared.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Aye---but the word! 
                  The first sound of the word!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  The council doth condemn---
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  All, father? All?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  No; there were two---Count Zeno could not join 
                   Guilty and Foscari; and I---my son, 
                  Thou couldst not do this deed!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Thank heaven! Thank heaven!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  The sentence, Doge!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Yes, father. The one pang, 
                  The worse than death,---the infamy is past. 
                  
                  The dagger's in my breast; now drive it home, 
                  And with a merciful speed.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Sir, thou will find 
                  Justice hath bowed to mercy.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Doge, the sentence!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  The penalty is death. But for thy rank, 
                  Thy services and mine, it is exchanged 
                  For banishment to Candia. Thou must live 
                  In Canea, an exile, till thy days 
                  Be ended, my dear son.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Live! Give me death! 
                  Ye that give infamy, and dare to talk 
                  Of mercy, give me death, painfullest death, 
                  And I will thank ye---bless ye! Give me death! 
                  Ye cannot give me life. Sooner the bay, 
                  That wreathes the warrior's brows, shall spread and flourish 
                  In a dark mine, shut up from sun and air, 
                  Than I can live without a proud respect 
                  A white unblemish'd name, the light and breath 
                   Of honour. Death I say!---a murderer's death! 
                  Ye dare not change the laws.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Live, and repent.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Cosmo, if e'er you loved me, call on them 
                  For justice---bloody justice! Doge of Venice, 
                  Maintain the insulted laws! Send me to death,--- 
                  To instant death! Oh father, free thy son 
                  From this dread load of misery! Would'st thou see 
                  Thy only child shunned as a leper, father? 
                  Sent out into the world a second Cain? 
                  Oh give me death! death! death!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I knew that life 
                  Would be a lingering agony; and yet 
                  To kill thee---my dear son! Oh prophecy 
                  Accurst, I feel thee now!
                  
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Remove the prisoner. 
                  What! doth he struggle?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Touch him not, vile slaves!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  A moment pause, and ye may lead me hence 
                  Tame as a fondled kid. Ye Senators, 
                  Ye kings of Venice, I appeal from you 
                  To the Supreme Tribunal.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  To thy father?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  To Him that is in heaven. Ye are men, 
                  Frail, erring, ignorant men, guided or driven 
                   By every warring passion: some by love 
                  Of the beloved Donati; some by hate 
                  Of the high Foscari; by envy some; 
                  Many by fear; and one by low ambition. 
                  This ye call justice, lords! But I appeal 
                  To the All-righteous Judge of earth and heaven, 
                  Before whose throne condemners and condemned 
                  All shall stand equal, at whose feet I swear, 
                  By what my soul holds sacred---by the spurs 
                  Of knighthood---by the Christian's holier Cross, 
                  And by that old man's white and reverend locks, 
                  That I am innocent. Ye, who disbelieve, 
                  And ye who doubt, and ye, the grovelling few, 
                  Believing who condemn, I shower on all 
                  Contempt and pardon. Now, guards, to the prison.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Look to the Doge.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Zeno, when I am gone 
                  Thou wilt be kind to him?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Even as a son! 
                  Even as thyself.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Thou truest friend, farewell!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Look to the Doge 
               
               END OF THE FOURTH ACT.
               
            
         
         
            ACT V.
            
               SCENE I.
               An Apartment in the Donato Palace.
               Cosmo and Erizzo.
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Gone to the prison! No! my lord Erizzo. 
                  I know Camilla.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Well---I might mistake.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Straight from her father's bier, where all night long 
                  She watch'd and wept, to seek---Go to, thou'rt wrong! 
                  Thou'rt wrong.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Think no more of it. Doth the Senate 
                  Meet to-day?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Was she veil'd?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Who?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Whom thou saw'st. 
                  She---not my sister!---Was she veil'd?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She was.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  How couldst thou know her?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  By the pliant grace 
                  Of the young form---the goddess step---the charm 
                  Of motion. With such port the queenly swan 
                  Glides o'er the waters. Dost thou not remember 
                  When Foscari once---
                  
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Avoid that name. Avoid it.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She's here.
                  Enter Camilla.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  And veil'd! Whence com'st thou, sister? speak. 
                  Why hast thou borne those tears and that wan face 
                  Abroad amongst the happy? Whence com'st thou?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                   From one whose heart drops blood for this great grief.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Whence?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  From St. Mark's.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  The Doge! The poor old Doge!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  The Doge! It was not by the Ducal chambers 
                  That I this morning saw---
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  My lord Erizzo, 
                  I seek not to deceive ye. I have seen 
                  The Doge. But 'twas another wretcheder 
                  Of whom I spake,---one who hath long to live. 
                  I come from where beneath the leaden roofs 
                  Foscari lies.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  And she can speak that name 
                  Sighingly, fondly! She can cast aside 
                  Even maiden modesty! Forgive me, friend, 
                  That trusting her I doubted thee. Approach not! 
                  Thou art contaminate.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He's innocent! 
                  Turn not away, shake me not off, as though 
                  I were some loathed reptile. Cosmo! Brother! 
                  We two are left alone in the wide world, 
                  And I, that sate upon that rainbow throne 
                  Of happiness, I am fallen, fallen.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  What would'st thou? 
                  
                  How may I comfort thee? Sweet gentle soul, 
                   Her tears are daggers. Speak.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  And thou wilt listen?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Patient as infancy.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He goes to-night; 
                  And I---nay, start not.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  What of thee?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  And I--- 
                  We were betroth'd; he goes a sentenc'd wretch--- 
                  But innocent, most innocent! He goes 
                  To scorn, to exile, and to misery, 
                  And I---I came to say farewell to thee 
                  My brother---I go with him.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She raves. 
                  Look how she trembles; she is overwatched; 
                  This is a frenzy.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Sir, I am not mad; 
                  I'm a Donato born, and drank in courage 
                  Even with my mother's milk. What if I shake! 
                  Within this trembling frame there is a heart 
                  As firm as thine. Speak to me ere we part, 
                  My brother! Speak to me, whatever words, 
                  However bitter! Any thing but silence, 
                  Cold withering silence!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Sister!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                   Bless thee, bless thee, 
                  For that kind word!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  My sister, sit thee down.--- 
                  Misery hath brought her to this pass.---Camilla, 
                  We had a father once:---he's slain. Would'st thou 
                  Join this white hand, which he so lov'd to mould 
                  Within his own, the soft and dimpled hand, 
                  With one---
                  
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Oh pure as thine! Believe it, Cosmo; 
                  Pure as thine own!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  We have no father now, 
                  And we should love each other. Stay with me. 
                  I am no tyrant-brother: I'll not force 
                  Thy blooming beauty to some old man's bed 
                  For high alliance; I'll not plunge thy youth 
                  Into that living tomb where the cold nun 
                  Chants daily requiems, that thy dower may swell 
                  My coffers; I but ask of thee to stay 
                  With me in thy dear Venice, thy dear home, 
                  Thy mistress, mine. I'll be to thee, Camilla, 
                  A father, brother, lover. Stay with me. 
                  I will be very kind to thee.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Oh cruel! 
                  This kindness is the rack.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  I would but save thee 
                   From exile, penury, shame---
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He said so.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  He!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Aye, he urg'd all that thou canst say against 
                  Himself and me---in vain. My heart is firm. 
                  I go. But love me still, oh love me still 
                  My brother!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Listen.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He said all.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Camilla! 
                  I'd save thee from a crime, a damning crime--- 
                  Did he say that? From such a parricide, 
                  Such unimagin'd sin---I tell thee, girl, 
                  The Roman harlot, she the infamous 
                  That crush'd her father with her chariot wheels, 
                  She'll be forgotten in thy monstrous guilt, 
                  Whitened by thy black shame.
                  
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Oh father, father, 
                  I call upon thee! Look on me from heav'n, 
                  Search my whole soul---'tis white. Oh when some tale 
                  Of woman's truth brought tears into my eyes, 
                  How often hath he said---Be thou, too, faithful 
                  In weal or woe! And now---farewell! farewell! 
                  Cosmo, my heart is breaking---Say farewell, 
                  Only farewell!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                   Stay with me.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  No.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Then go, 
                  Outcast of earth and heaven, of God and man! 
                  Abandon'd, spurn'd, abhorr'd, accurst! Go forth 
                  A murderer's bride---worse! worse! What impious priest 
                  Will dare profane the holy words that join 
                  The pure of heart and hand for ye, for ye, 
                  The parricides---Oh that she had but died 
                  Innocent in her childhood.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  One day, brother, 
                  Thou'lt grieve for this. Now bless thee!
                  Exit Camilla.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Stay!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She's gone.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Why let her go, foul stain upon our house! 
                  She was his daughter still, and yesterday 
                  An Angel! And he loved her and she him 
                  With such a dotage! 'Twas a sight to see 
                  How ere the pretty babe could speak its will, 
                  The chubby hands would cling and fix themselves 
                  Round its dear father's neck. Mother, or nurse, 
                  Or I, the elder child that played with her 
                  Full half the day, were nothing if she caught 
                  One glimpse of that dear father.
                  
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Now she'll hang 
                   Around his murderer's neck.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Do ye all forget. 
                  That I'm her brother? Ho, Camilla!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  'Twill be 
                  A triumph 'mid their shame to these misproud 
                  Revengeful Foscari to bear off thus 
                  The glory of your house.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  I'll rescue her. 
                  Where is she? Is she gone? What ho, Camilla! 
                  I'll follow her to the end of the earth. The laws 
                  Give me a father's power. I'll save her yet. 
                  Camilla! Ho, Camilla!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  You must seek her 
                  With him. The time draws near. 
                  Cosmo rushes out.
                  Now, Foscari, 
                  I have thee at my feet.
               
               Exit.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               The Sea Shore.
               Doge, Foscari, Guards.
               
                  Foscari.
                  Here then we part. Those Guards---send them away, 
                  Let them not listen to the last faint word, 
                  Nor gaze on the last lingering look Why doubt'st thou? 
                  Fear me not---I'll be a true prisoner. 
                  I am a Foscari still, bound by one chain, 
                  Honour. Send them away.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Leave us.
               
               Exeunt Guards.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Aye, now 
                  My soul is free again. That tallest slave 
                  Stood brushing against my vest---he with the hard 
                  Cold stony eyes---and I---let not that man 
                  Go with me.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  He shall not.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  How can I waste 
                  A word on such a reptile! I'd a world 
                  Of sad and loving things to say to thee, 
                  But there's a weight just here---Oh father! father! 
                  I thought to have been a comfort to thy age, 
                  But I was born to spread a desolation 
                  On all I love.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I would not change my son, 
                  Banished although he be, with the proudest sire 
                  In Christendom. But we must part. These men 
                  Are merciless.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                   Implore no grace of them. 
                  And yet to leave this brave and tender heart 
                  To wither in its princely solitude, 
                  Friendless, companionless.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Age hath one friend, 
                  One sure friend---Death.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Oh I shall not be by 
                  To close thine eyes or kneel beside thy couch, 
                  Or gather from thy lips the last fond sound 
                  Of blessing or of pardon. Bless me now, 
                  Parting is dying.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Bless thee, my dear son. 
                  Enter Camilla.
                  Camilla!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Bless her too. She is thy daughter; 
                  She goes with me to exile.
                  
               
               
                  Doge.
                  She is blest 
                  In her high constancy. Beloved child 
                  Thy virtuous love hath softened the sharp pang 
                  Of this dread hour.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Father! My only Father! 
                  Foscari, the bark awaits us.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  What, already?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  All is prepared.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I should have told thee so; 
                  But when I would have said, Go! go! my tongue 
                   Clave to my mouth.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Already! Write to me 
                  Often. Is that forbidden? Yet the Doge 
                  May ask my Candiote jailer if his prisoner 
                  Be strictly kept. Then I shall sometimes see, 
                  For surely he will shew it me, thy name, 
                  Thy writing, something thou hast touched. 'Twill be 
                  A comfort.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I will write to thee.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  And think 
                  Of me when the pale moon lets fall her cold 
                  And patient light upon the Adrian wave 
                  That sighs and trembles. Think of me then.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Always. 
                  By sun, or moon, or star; in the bright day 
                  In the night's darkness, but one single thought 
                  Will dwell in my old heart---My banished son.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Alas! Francesco, why wilt thou prolong 
                  This useless agony?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  He hath not said 
                  Farewell. One last embrace, one blessing more--- 
                  The last!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  What step is that? 
                  
                  Enter Zeno.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  I crave your pardon: 
                  But I must pray the Doge to come with me 
                   Straight to the Senate. 'Tis an earnest business. 
                  I do beseech your Highness. Leave him, Foscari! 
                  Cling not together as your very souls 
                  Were interlaced. The Senate, Doge, demands thee.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  The Senate! What! hath he another son 
                  To try, to torture, to condemn? Hath he 
                  Another heart to break? Yet go. For once 
                  Their cruelty is mercy. Go.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Whilst still 
                  These eyes may gaze on thee! Ere yonder cloud 
                  Shall pass across the sun, a darker cloud 
                  Will wrap me in its blackness; then the throne, 
                  The judgment seat, the grave---no matter where 
                  The old man rests his bones!---One dim eclipse 
                  Will shadow all---but now---say to the senate 
                  That at their bidding I am sending forth 
                  My son to exile.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Go! go!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Doge, thy duty, 
                  Thy princely duty calls thee.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  To that word, 
                  Which was to me a god, have I not offered 
                  My child upon the altar? Is the sacrifice 
                  Still incomplete? Farewell! farewell!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Francesco, 
                   Embark not till ye hear from me.---My lord, 
                  This way.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I pray you pardon me---I'm old--- 
                  I'm very old.
                  Exeunt Doge and Zeno
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Nay sit not shivering there 
                  Upon the ground. Hast thou no word for me, 
                  
                  Francesco?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Is he gone? Quite gone? For ever?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Take comfort.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Is he gone? I did not say 
                  Farewell, nor God be with thee! When men part 
                  From common friends for a slight summer voyage 
                  They cry Heaven speed thee! and I could not say 
                  Farewell to my dear father, nor call down 
                  One benison on that white reverend head 
                  Which I shall never see again. There breathes not 
                  A wretch so curst as I.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Foscari, the lips 
                  That I have kissed are cold.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Oh bruised flower, 
                  Whose very wounds do shed an odorous balm! 
                  My gentle comforter! could I forget 
                  Thy misery! Forgive me.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  I have left 
                  His bier, his bloody bier.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                   Aye, there it is! 
                  Fortune, and friends, and home, to fly from them 
                  Were nothing---but she leaves the unburied corse 
                  Of her dead father, the dear privilege 
                  To sit and watch till the last hour, to strew 
                  His body with sweet flowers like a bank in spring 
                  Making death beautiful, to follow him 
                  To his cold bed, and drop slow heavy tears 
                  To the bell's knolling. She leaves grief to go 
                  With me, whom the world calls---Oh matchless love, 
                  Life could not pay thee! Matchless, matchless love!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He, that blest spirit, knows thy innocence: 
                  And I---I never doubted.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Matchless love! 
                  We'll never part, we'll live and die together, 
                  
                  There is a comfort in the word. Camilla, 
                  Where are the guards, the ship? My heart beats high 
                  At thy exceeding truth. We shall set forth 
                  As to a victory.
                  Enter Cosmo, and Erizzo.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  She's here! She's here. 
                  Move not a step. Dare not to stir. Camilla, 
                  Follow me.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Who is he that dares obstruct 
                  The mandate of the Senate? I'm an exile 
                  Travelling to banishment. All Venice knows 
                   The piteous story of the Doge's son 
                  Condemned by his own father, and of her 
                  His true and faithful love. Now leave us, Sir; 
                  Let us depart in peace.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Murderer! Ravisher! 
                  I seek my sister.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  She stands there. Ask her 
                  Whom she will follow.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He knows well. Francesco, 
                  The whole world shall not part us.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Mine! Mine own! 
                  My very own! I've lost wealth, country, home, 
                  Fame, friends, and father; I have nothing left 
                  Save thee, my dear one; but with thee I'm rich, 
                  And great, and happy. Now let us go forth 
                  Into our banishment. Give me thy hand, 
                  My wife.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Camilla, I command thee stay--- 
                  The laws of Venice give to me a power 
                  Absolute as a father's. Loose her, Sir. 
                  Let go her hand. I warn ye part. They'll drive me 
                  
                  Into a madness. If thou be a man 
                  Let's end this quarrel bravely.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Heed him not!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Calm thee! He is thy brother.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                   I disclaim her.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Tremble not so! I am unarmed, Camilla.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Dost hold her as a shield before thy breast? 
                  Dost palter with me, coward?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  (breaking from Camilla)
                  Off!---A sword! 
                  A sword for charity!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Help! Help! The Doge! 
                  The guard! Stay with them! Part them! Leave them not! 
                  Hold them asunder, Count, and in my prayers 
                  Thou shalt be sainted! Help.
                  Camilla rushes out.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Give me a sword!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Aye his or mine. I am so strongly armed 
                  In my most righteous cause. I would encounter 
                  A mailed warrior with a willow wand.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  There is my weapon.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Why thou wast my foe! 
                  But this is such a bounty as might shame 
                  The princely hand of friendship. Not the blade 
                  Girt by a crowned Duke around my loins, 
                  An Emperor's gift, the day I won my spurs 
                  In the Suabian victory, not that knightly sword 
                  Was welcomer than this.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Foscari, come on!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  I would thou wert a soldier!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Now.
                  They fight, and Foscari falls.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                   The fates 
                  Work for me.---Ha!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Erizzo.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Is he dead? 
                  
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Alas! Alas! Lift up his head.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  (behind the scene)
                  Here! Here! 
                  Canst thou not hasten. 
                  Enter Camilla and the Doge.
                  entering)
                  Foscari! He's slain! 
                  Oh bloody, bloody brother! Kill me too! 
                  Be merciful! Help!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Doth he live?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Away! 
                  Thy hands are bloody!---Help, Doge Foscari! 
                  Help Father!---The old man stands stiffening there 
                  Into a statue---He'll die first Off! Off! 
                  Wouldst kill him o'er again?---He bleeds to death! 
                  Father, it is thy blood.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My son! My son! 
                  Who hath done this?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He is not dead. Support him. 
                  See how his eye-lids quiver. Foscari! 
                  'Tis I, thy wife!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Mine own!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Thanks gracious Heaven!
                  Enter Zeno and Guards.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Seize Count Erizzo, Guard. Have ye not heard--- 
                   What spectacle is this?---Know ye not, Sirs, 
                  That Foscari is guiltless, that the murderer 
                  Is found?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Hear that! I'm innocent! Hear that! 
                  The murderer is found! Nay, hold me not--- 
                  I'm well---I'm strong. Father, there is no stain 
                  In the long line of Foscari! Camilla, 
                  My Faithfullest---
               
               
                  Doge.
                  He falls. 
                  
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  There wanted this 
                  To crown the brimming cup of my despair. 
                  We should have been the happiest two, Francesco, 
                  Since the first pair in Paradise---but he 
                  That was my brother---
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Peace. Who slew Donato?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Celso, bribed by Erizzo to destroy 
                  Francesco Foscari by Donato crossed 
                  Slew him, and aided by the sword and cloak 
                  Dropped by Francesco, cast this deed of horror 
                  On the most innocent.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Hath he confessed?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  All. Seize Erizzo, bind him.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  There's no need. 
                  The work is done, well done---Signor Donato, 
                  I thank thee still for that---and such revenge 
                   Is cheaply bought with life.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Oh, damned viper!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Aye! Do ye know me? Not a man of ye 
                  But is my tool or victim. I'm your master. 
                  This was my aim when old Donato died, 
                  And but that Celso dared not cope with Foscari 
                  And sought to catch him in a subtler springe 
                  I had been now your Doge. And I am more. 
                  I am your master, Sirs. Look where he lies 
                  The towering Foscari, who yesterday 
                  Stood statelier than the marble gods of Rome 
                  In their proud beauty. Hearken! It is mute, 
                  The tongue which darted words of fiery scorn 
                  And cold contempt, and bitter pardon---dared 
                  To hurl on me fierce pardon! Ha! he shivers! 
                  His stout limbs writhe! The insect that is born 
                  And dies within an hour would not change lives 
                  With Foscari. I am content. For thee 
                  
                  I have a tenfold curse. Long be thy reign, 
                  Great Doge of Venice!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Aye, I am the Doge; 
                  Lead him to instant death. 
                  Exit Erizzo guarded.
                  My son!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  'Tis I 
                  That am the only murderer of the earth--- 
                   I that slew him. Bring racks and axes---
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Live! 
                  I pardon thee. He pardons thee. Live, Cosmo; 
                  It is thy Prince's last behest. I've been 
                  O'erlong a crowned slave. Go! dross to dross. 
                  Flinging off the Ducal Bonnet.
                  And bruise the stones of Venice! Tell the senate 
                  There lies their diadem. Now I am free! 
                  Now I may grieve and pity like a man! 
                  May weep, and groan, and die! My heart may burst 
                  Now! Start not, Zeno---Didst thou never hear 
                  Of a broken heart? Look there.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Hush! He revives.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  My Foscari!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Camilla! Is't Camilla? 
                  Is she not weeping? What canst thou weep now 
                  When honour is redeemed and a bright name? 
                  Why there should be no tear in all the world; 
                  Gladness is come from Heaven.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Death! Death!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  This joy 
                  Is life. Who talked of death? I cannot die 
                  In such a happiness. I'm well.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  He sinks; 
                  Support him.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Is he dead? 
                  
               
               
                  Doge.
                   Beloved son. 
                  How art thou?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Strong at heart. What are those shapes 
                  That hover round us? There! There! There!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Thy friends.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Friends! Have they heard that I am innocent? 
                  That I'm no murderer? That I do not shame 
                  My father's glory? Let it be proclaimed---
                  Tell Venice---tell---
                  dies.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  He's gone.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Mine! Still mine own! 
                  Bury me with him! He is mine.
               
               THE END.
            
         
      
         
            I.
            
               Scene 1:
               An Apartment in the Royal Palace.
               An Apartment in the Royal Palace. Julian sleeping on a Couch. Annabel.
               
                  Annab.
                  No; still he
							sleeps! ’Twas but the myrtle
							bud
                  Tapping against the casement, as the wind
                  Stirred in the leafy branches. Well he loved
                  That pleasant bird-like sound, which, as a voice
                  Summon’d us forth into the fresher
							air
                  Of eve, or early morn. Ah! when
							again—
                  And yet his sleep is hopeful. For seven nights
                  He had not tasted slumber. Who comes here?
                  Enter Alfonso as Theodore
                  The gentle page! Alas! To wake him now!
                  Hush, Theodore! Tread softly—softlier, boy!
               
               
                  Alfon-
                  Doth he still sleep?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Speak lower.
               
               
                  Alfon
                  Doth he sleep?
               
               
                  Annab
                  Avoid the couch; come this way; close to me.
                  
                  He sleeps. He hath not moved in all the hours
                  That thou hast been away.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Then we may hope,
                  Dear lady, we may hope!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Alas! Alas!
                  See how he lies, scarce breathing. Whilst I hung
                  Over his couch I should have thought him
							dead,
                  but for his short and frequent sighs.
               
               
                  Alfon
                  Ah me!
                  Not even in slumber can he lose the sense
                  Of that deep misery; and I—he wakes!
                  Dost thou not see the quivering mantle heave
                  With sudden motion?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Thou hast wakened him.
                  Thy clamorous grief hath roused him. Hence! Begone!
                  Leave me!
                  
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  And yet his eyes are closed. He sleeps.
                  He did but move his hand.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  How changed he is!
                  How pale! How wasted! Can one little
							week
                  
                  Of pain and sickness so have faded thee,
                  My princely Julian! But eight days ago
                  There lived not in this gladsome Sicily
                  So glad a spirit. Voice, and step, and eye,
                  All were one happiness; till that dread
							hour,
                  When drest in sparkling smiles, radiant and
							glowing,
                  With tender thoughts, he flew to meet the King
                  And his great father. He went forth
							alone;
                  Frenzy and grief came back with him.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  And I, 
                  Another grief.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Thou wast a comforter.
                  All stranger as thou art, hast thou not shared
                  My watch as carefully, as faithfully,
                  As I had been thy
							sister? Aye, and he
                  If ever in this wild mysterious woe
                  One sight or sound hath cheered him, it hath been
                  A glance, a word of thine.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  He knows me not.
               
               
                  Ann.
                  He knows not me.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I never heard before
                  That ’twas to meet the King yon fatal
					          		night—
                  Knowingly, purposely— How could he guess
                  That they should meet? What moved him to that thought?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Stranger, although thou be, thou canst but know
                  Prince Julian’s father is the regent here,
                  And rules for his young kinsman King Alfonso!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Aye—Poor Alfonso!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Wherefore pity him?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I know not—but I am an orphan
							too!
                  I interrupt thee, lady.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Yet, in truth,
                  A gentle pity lingers round the name
                  Of King Alfonso orphaned, as thou
							sayst,
                  And drooping into sickness when he
							lost
                  His father, ever since, the mournful
							boy
                  Hath dwelt in the Villa d’Oro.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  Hast thou seen him?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  The King? No— I’m of Naples. When Prince Julian
                  First brought me here a bride, his royal
							cousin
                  Was fixed beside his father’s dying bed.
                  I never saw him: yet I know him
							well;
                  For I have sate and listen’d, hour by hour,
                  To hear my husband speak of the fair
							Prince,
                  
                  And his excelling virtues.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  Did he?—Ah!--
                  But ’twas his wont, talking of those he loved,
                  To gild them with the rich, and burnish’d glow
                  Of his own brightness, as the evening sun
                  Decks all the clouds in glory.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Very dear
                  Was that young boy to Julian. ’Twas a
							friendship,
                  Fonder than common, blended with a kind
                  Protecting tenderness; such as brother
                  Might fitly shew unto the younger born.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Oh, he hath proved it.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Thou dost know them both?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I do. Say on, dear lady.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Three weeks
							since
                  The Duke of Melfi went to bring his ward
                  Here to Messina—
                  
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  To be crowned. They came not.
                  But wherefore went Prince Julian forth to meet them?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Father nor cousin came; nor messenger,
                  From Regent or from King; and Julian
							chafed
                  And fretted at delay. At length, a
							peasant,
                  No liveried groom; a slow foot-pacing serf,
                  Brought tidings that the royal two, that
							morn
                  Left Villa d’Oro. Glowing from the chase
                  Prince Julian stood, the bridle in his hand,
                  New lighted, soothing now his prancing steed.
                  
                  And prattling now to me;— for I was still
                  So foolish fond to fly into the porch
                  To meet him, when I heard the quick sharp
									tread
                  Of that bright Arab, whose proud step I knew
                  Even as his master’s voice. He heard the tale
                  And instant sprang again into his seat,
                  Wheeled round, and darted off at such a pace
                  As the fleet greyhound, at her speed, could
									scarce
                  Have matched. He spake no word; but as he
									passed,
                  
                  Just glanced back at me, with his dancing eyes,
                  And such a smile of joy, and such a wave
                  Of his plumed bonnet! His return thou
							know’st.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I was his wretched partner.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He on foot,
                  Thou on the o’er-travelled horse, slow, yet all
							stained
                  With sweat, and panting, as if fresh escaped
                  From hot pursuit; and how he called for wine
                  For his poor Theodore, his faithful
							page;
                  
                  Then sate him down and shook with the cold fit
                  Of anguish fever, till the strong couch rocked
                  Like a child’s cradle. There he sate and sigh’d;
                  And then the frenzy came. Theodore!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Lady!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He utters nought but madness;—yet sometimes,
                  Athwart his ravings, I have thought—have
							feared—
                  Theodore, thou must know the
							cause?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Too well.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh, tell me—
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Hush! He
							wakes.
               
               Alfonso retires behind the couch, out of Julian’s sight.
               
                  Annab.
                  Going to Julian, whilst Alfonso keeps behind the couch, out of his sight
                  Julian! Dear Julian!
               
               
                  Julian
                  Sure I have slept a long, long while! Where am I?
                  How came I hither? Whose kind hand is this?
                  My Annabel!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh, what a happiness 
                  To see thee gently wake from gentle sleep!
                  
                  Art thou not better? Shall I raise thee up?
               
               
                  Julian
                  Aye, dearest. Have I then been ill? I’m
							weak,
                  I trouble thee, my sweet one.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  ’Tis a joy
                  To minister unto thee.
               
               
                  Julian
                  Wipe my brow.
                  And part these locks, that the fresh air may cool
                  My forehead; feel; it
							burns.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Alas! how wild
                  This long neglect hath made thy glossy
							curls,
                  How tangled!
               
               
                  Julian
                  I am faint. Pray, lay me down.
                  Surely the day is stifling
               
               
                  Annab.
                  There.Good boy.
                  Throw wide the casement. Doth not the soft breeze
                  Revive thee?
               
               
                  Julian
                  
                  Yes. I’m better. I will rise.
                  Raise me again;—more upright;— So! Dear
									wife,
                  A sick man is as wayward as a child;
                  
                  Have I been long ill?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  A week.
               
               
                  Julian
                  I have no memory of aught. ’Tis just
                  Like waking from a dream; a
							horrible
                  Confusion of strange miseries; crime and
							blood
                  And all I love.— Great Heaven, how clear it
							seems!
                  How like a truth! I thought that I rode forth
                  On my white Barbary horse—Say, did I
							ride
                  Alone that day?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Did I? Could I? No.
                  Thou dost mistake. I did not. Yet ’tis
							strange
                  How plain that horror lives within my
							brain
                  As what hath been.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Forget it.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Annabel,
                  I thought I was upon that gallant steed
                  At his full pace. Like clouds before the wind
                  We flew, as easily as the strong bird
                  That soars nearest the sun; till in a
							pass,
                  
                  Between the mountains, screams and cries of
							help
                  Rang in mine ears, and I beheld—O
							God!
                  It was not—Could not—No. I have been sick
                  Of a sharp fever, and delirium shews,
                  And to the bodily sense makes palpable,
                  Unreal forms, objects of sight and
							sound
                  Which have no being save in the burning
							brain
                  Of the poor sufferer. Why should it shake me!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Couldst thou walk to the window and
							quaff down
                  The fragrant breeze, it would revive thee more
                  Than food or sleep. Forget these evil dreams.
                  Canst thou not walk?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’ll try.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Lean upon me,
                  And Theodore. Approach dear boy; support him.
                  Alfonso approaches Julian
               
               
                  Julian.
                  seeing Alfonso
                  Ha! Art thou here? Thou! I am blinded, dazzled!
                  Is this a vision, this fair shape that seems
                  A living child? Do I dream now?
                  
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He is
                  Young Theodore. The page, who that sad night
                  Returned—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Then all is real. Lay me down
                  That I may die
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Alas! I feared too surely
                  That when he saw me,—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Julian! This is grief,
                  Not sickness. Julian!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Rouse him not, dear
							lady!
                  See how his hands are clenched. Waken him
							not
                  To frenzy. Oh that I alone could bear
                  This weight of misery.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He knows the cause, 
                  And I— It is my right, my privilege
                  To share thy woes, to soothe them. I’ll weep with thee,
                  And that will be a comfort. Didst thou think
                  
                  Thou could’st be dearer to me than
						            	before
                  When thou wast well and happy? But thou art
                  Now. Tell me this secret.  I’ll be faithful,
                  I’ll never breathe a word. Oh spare my
							heart
                  This agony of doubt! What was the horror
                  That maddened thee?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Within the rifted rocks
                  Of high Albano, rotting in a glen,
                  Dark, dark at very noon, a father lies
                  Murdered by his own son.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  And thou didst see
                  The deed! An awful sight to one so good!
                  Yet—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Birds obscene, and wolf, and ravening fox,
                  Ere this— only the dark hairs on the ground.
                  And the brown crusted blood! And she can ask
                  Why I am mad!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh! a thrice awful night
                  To one so duteous! Holy priests should lave
                  With blessed water that foul spot, and thou,
                  Pious and pitying, thou shalt—
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Hear at once,
                  Innocent Torturer, that drop by drop
                  Pour’st molten lead into my wounds—that glen—
                  Hang not upon me!—In that darksome glen
                  My father lies. I am a murderer,
                  A parricide, accurst of God and man.
                  Let go my hand! purest and whitest saint,
                  Let go!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  This is a madness. Even now
                  The fever shakes him.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Why, the mad are happy!
                  Annabel, this is a soul-slaying truth.
                  There stands a witness.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Julian knew him not.
                  It was to save a life, a worthless
							life.
                  Oh that I had but died beneath the sword
                  That seemed so terrible! That I had ne’er
                  Been born to grieve thee Julian! Pardon me,
                  Dear lady, pardon me!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh, gentle boy,
                  
                  How shall we soothe this grief?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Alas! alas!
                  Why did he rescue me! I’m a poor orphan;
                  None would have wept for me; I had no
							friend
                  In all the worldsave one. I had been reared.
                  In simpleness; a quiet grave had been
                  A fitter home for me than the rude world;
                  A mossy heap, no stone, no epitaph,
                  Save the brief words of grief and praise (for Grief
                  Is still a Praiser) he perchance had spoke
                  When they first told him the poor boy was dead.
                  Shame on me, that I shunned the sword!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  By Heaven,
                  It could not be a crime to save thee! kneel
                  Before him, Annabel. He is the king
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Alfonso?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Aye, so please you, fairest Cousin,
                  But still your servant. Do not hate me,
							Lady,
                  Though I have caused this misery. We have shared
                  One care, one fear, one hope, have watched and wept
                  Together. Oh how often I have longed,
                  As we sate silent by his restless couch,
                  To fall upon thy neck and mix our tears,
                  And talk of him. I am his own poor Cousin.
                  Thou wilt not hate me?
                  
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Save that lost one, who
                  Could hate such innocence?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  ’Twas not in hate,
                  But wild ambition. No ignoble sin
                  Dwelt in his breast. Ambition, mad ambition,
                  That was his Idol. To that bloody god
                  He offered up the milk-white
							sacrifice,
                  The pure, unspotted Victim. And even then,
                  Even in the crime, without a breathing space
                  For penitence, or prayer, my sword—Alfonso,
                  Thou would’st have gone to Heaven.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Art thou certain
                  That he is dead?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I saw him fall. The ground
                  Was covered with his blood.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Tell me the tale.
                  Didst thou— I would not wantonly recall
                  That scene of anguish—Didst thou search his wound?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Annabel, in my eyes that scene will dwell
                  For ever, shutting out all lovely sights,
                  Even thee, my Beautiful! That torturing thought
                  Will burn a living fire within my
						            	breast
                  Perpetually; words can nothing add,
                  And nothing take away. Fear not my frenzy;
                  I am calm now. Thou know’st how buoyantly
                  I darted from thee, straight o’er vale and hill,
                  Counting the miles by minutes. At the pass
                  Between the Albano mountains, I first breathed
                  A moment my hot steed, expecting still
                  To see the royal escort. Afar off
                  As I stood, shading with my hand my eyes,
                  I thought I saw them; when at once I heard
                  From the deep glen, east of the pass, loud cries
                  Of mortal terror. Even in agony
                  I knew the voice, and darting through the trees.
                  I saw Alfonso, prostrate on the ground,
                  Clinging around the knees of one, who held
                  A dagger over him in act to strike,
                  Yet with averted head, as if he feared
                  To see his innocent victim. His own face
                  Was hidden; till at one spring I plunged my sword
                  
                  Into his side; then our eyes met, and he—
                  
                     That was the mortal blow!
									—screamed and stretched out
                  His hands. Falling and dying as he was,
                  He half rose up, hung speechless in the air,
                  And looked—Oh what had been the bitterest
									curse
                  To such a look! It smote me like a sword!
                  Here, here. He died.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  And thou?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I could have lain
                  In that dark glen for ever; but there stood
                  The dear-bought, and the dear, kinsman and prince
                  And friend. We heard the far-off clang of steeds
                  And armed men, and fearing some new foe,
                  Came homeward.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  And did he, then, the unhappy,
                  Remain upon the ground?
               
               
                  Julisn.
                  Alas! he did. 
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh! it was but a swoon. Listen, dear Julian,
                  I tell thee I have comfort.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  There is none
                  Left in the world. But I will listen to thee
                  My Faithfullest.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Count D’Alba sent to crave
                  An audience. Thou wast sleeping. I refused
                  To see him; but his messenger revealed
                  
                  To Constance his high tidings, which she poured
                  In my unwilling ears, for I so feared
                  To wake thee, that ere half her tale was told
                  I chid her from me; yet she surely said
                  The Duke thy father—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  What?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Approached the city.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Alive? Alive? Oh no! no! no! Dead! Dead!
                  The corse, the clay-cold corse!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Alive, I think;
                  But Constance—
               
               
                  Alf.
                  He will sink under this shock
                  Of hope.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Constance heard all.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Constance! What ho,
                  Constance!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  She hears thee not.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Go seek her! Fly!
                  If he’s alive—Why art thou not returned,
                  
                  When that one little word will save two souls!
                  Exit Annabel.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Take patience, dearest Cousin!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Do I not stand
                  Here like a man of marble? Do I stir?
                  She creeps; she creeps. Thou would’st have gone and back
                  In half the time.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Nay, nay, ’tis scarce a minute.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Thou may’st count hours and ages on my heart.
                  Is she not coming?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Shall I seek her?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Hark!
                  They’ve met. There are two steps; two silken gowns
                  Rustling; one whispering voice. Annabel!
							Constance.
                  Is he—one word!Only one word!
                   Enter Annabel. 
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He lives.
               
               Julian sinks on his knees before the couch; Alfonso and
								Annabel go to him, and the scene falls.
               End of the First Act.
               
            
         
         
            II.
            
               Scene 1
               A splendid Hall of Audience in the Royal Palace.
               D’Alba and Bertone.
               
                  D’Alba.
                  
                  Again refuse to see me!
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Nay, my lord,
                  She’s still beside her husband’s couch, and Paolo
                  Refused to bear the message.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Even her lacquey
                  Reads my hot love and her contempt. No matter!
                  How’s Julian?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Mending fast.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He’ll live! He’ll live!
                  She watches over him, making an air
                  With her sweet breath;—he’ll be immortal! Yet
                  If that dark tale be true—or half—Bertone,
                  Haste to the Court of Guard; seek Juan Castro,
                  A Spanish soldier; lead him home. I’ll join ye.
                  Hence! I expect the Barons, whom I summoned
                  To meet me here. Come back. See if the Princess
                  
                  Will now admit me. No! ’twould wake suspicion.
                  Hence to the Court of Guard
                   Exit Bertone
                  I think that scorn
                  Doth fan love more than beauty. Twice to-day
                  Have I paced patiently these royal halls,
                  Like some expecting needy courtier. Swell not,
                  Proud charmer, thy vast debt! Where lag these Barons?
                  Methinks this change might rouse—
                  Enter Calvi, followed by other Nobles.
                  Ha! Calvi, welcome.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  A fair good morrow, D’Alba!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Hast thou heard
                  These heavy tidings? The young kingKing—
                  Approaching to meet the other Lords as they enter.
                  My Lords,
                  Good morrow’s out of date. Know ye the
							news?
                  So men salute to-day.

                  Alfonso dead?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Murdered.

                  Stumbles at these new dignities!--the King.
                  Therefore I summoned ye. He will be here
                  Anon.
                  Enter Valore and other Nobles.

                  The King. How he will wear his state! Why, D’Alba,
                  Thy worshipped Annabel chose well; she’ll be
                  A Queen.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Yet, my poor title, had she graced it,
                  Comes by unquestion’d sheer descent, unstain’d
                  By dark, mysterious murder. My good fathers—
                  Heaven rest their souls!—lie safely in the churchyard,
                  A simple race; whilst these high Princes—Sirs,
                  These palace walls have echoes, or I’d tell ye—
                  ’Tis a deep riddle, but amongst them all
                  The pretty boy is dead.

                  The King is at the gate.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  The King! Now, Sirs,
                  Don your quick smiles, and bend your supple
							knees;—
                  The King!
                  Enter Melfi.
                  aside
                  He’s pale, he hath been hurt.aloud My liege,
                  Your vassals bid you welcome.
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Noble Signors,
                  I greet you well. Thanks, D’Alba. Good Leanti
                  I joy to see those reverend locks. I never
                  Thought to behold a friendly face again.
                  And now I bring ye sorrow. Death hath been
                  Too busy; though the ripe and bearded ear
                  Escap’d his sickle—but ye know the tale;
                  Ye welcomed me as King; and I am spared
                  The painful repetition. 
               
               
                  Valore.
                  Sire, we know
                  From your own royal hand enough for joy
                  And sorrow. Death hath ta’en a goodly child
                  And spared a glorious man. But how—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  My lord,
                  What wouldst thou more? Before I entered here
                  Messina’s general voice had hailed her Sovereign.
                  Lacks but the ceremonial form. ’Twere best
                  The accustomed pageant were performed even
							now,
                  Whilst ye, Sicilian Barons, strength and grace
                  Of our Sicilian realm, are here to pledge
                  Solemn allegiance. Say I sooth, Count D’Alba?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  In sooth my liege, I know not. Seems to me
                  One form is wanting. Our bereaved state
                  Stands like a widow, one eye dropping tears
                  For her lost lord, the other turned with smiles
                  On her new bridegroom. But even she, the Dame
                  Of Ephesus, the buxom relict, famed
                  For quick dispatch o’er every widowed mate,
                  Woman or state—even she, before she wed,
                  Saw the good man entombed. The Funeral first;
                  And then the Coronation.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Scoffer! Lords,
                  The corse is missing.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  Ha! Perchance he lives?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  He fell, I tell thee.
               
               
                  Valore.
                  And the Assassin?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  He
                  Escaped, when I too fell.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He! Why, my liege,
                  Was there but one?
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What mean ye, Sirs? Stand off.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Cannot your Highness guess the murderer?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Stand from about me, Lords! Dare ye to front
                  A King? What do ye doubt me; you, or you?
                  Dare ye to doubt me? Dare ye look a question
                  Into mine eyes? Take thy gaze off! A King
                  Demands a modester regard. Now, Sirs,
                  What do ye seek? I tell ye, the fair boy
                  Fell underneath the assassin’s sword; and I,
                  Wounded almost to death, am saved to prove
                  My subjects’ faith, to punish, to reward,
                  To reign, I tell ye, nobles. Now, who questions?
                  Who glares upon me now? What! are ye mute?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Deign to receive our homage, Sire, and pardon
                  The undesigned offence. Your Highness knows
                  Count D’Alba’s mood.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  And he knows mine. Well! Well!
                  
                  Be all these heats forgotten.
                  
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  to D’Alba
                  How his eye
                  Wanders around the circle.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Ye are met,
                  Barons of Sicily, in such august
                  And full assemblage as may well beseem
                  Your office, honour well yourselves and me;
                  Yet one is missing,—greatest, first and best,—
                  My son. Knows not Prince Julian that his father
                  Is here? Will he not come? Go, some one say
                  That I would see him.
                  Exit Calvi
               
               
                  Valore.
                  Sire, the Prince hath lain
                  Sick of a desperate malady.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Alas!
                  And I—Sick didst thou say?
               
               
                  Valore.
                  Eight days have passed
                  Since he hath left his couch.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  He’s better now.
                  The gentle Princess, who with one young page
                  Hath tended him—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What page?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  A stranger boy,
                  Seen but of few, young Theodore.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  A stranger!
                  Say on. The Princess—?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  As I crossed the hall,
                  I met her, with her own glad step, her look
                  Of joy; and when I asked how fared Prince Julian?
                  She put her white hands into mine, with such
                  A smile, and then passed on.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Without a word?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Without a word, save the mute eloquence
                  Of that bright smile.
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  aside
                  Oh ’twas enough! on him!
                  Smile on that dotard! Whilst I—aloud Why my lords,
                  Here’s a fine natural sympathy; the son
                  Sickens at the father’s wound! The very day!
                  The very hour! He must have known the deed—
                  Perchance he knows the assassin—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Stop.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  My liege,
                  I speak it in his honour. Many an heir
                  Had been right glad to step into a throne
                  Just as the mounting pulse of youth beat high;—
                  A soldier too! and with a bride so fair,
                  So delicate, so fashioned for a Queen
                  By cunning nature. But he—for full surely
                  He knew—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Stop. No, no, no, he knew it not!
                  He is my son.
                  Enter Calvi, followed by Julian.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  My liege, the
							Prince!
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Already!
                  Pardon me, good my lords, that I request
                  A moment’s loneliness. We have been near
                  To death since last—Have touched upon the grave,
                  And there are thoughts, which only our own hearts
                  Should hear. I pray ye pardon me. I’ll join ye
                  Within the hour for the procession.
                  Exeunt D’Alba, Leanti, Valore, Calvi &c.
               
               
                  
                  Julian!
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Father!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I know what thou would’st say. The hat
                  And sable plumes concealed—No more of it.
               
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Jul.
                  Oh, Father!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Rise, my son. Let us forget
                  What—How is Annabel? They say she has been
                  A faithful nurse. Thou hast been sick?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’m well.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Fie! when thou tremblest so.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’m well. I have been
                  Sick, brainsick, heartsick, mad. I thought—I feared—
                  It was a foretaste of the pains of Hell
                  To be so mad and yet retain the sense
                  Of that which made me so. But thou art here,
                  And I—Oh nothing but a father’s heart
                  Could ever have forgiven!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  No more. No more!
                  Thou hast not told me of thy wife.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  She waits
                  
                  
                  To pay her duty.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Stay. Count D’Alba looked
                  With evil eyes upon thee, and on me
                  Cast his accustomed tauntings. Is there aught
                  
                  Amiss between ye?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  No.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  He hath not yet
                  Perhaps forgotten your long rivalry
                  For Annabel’s fair hand. A dangerous meaning
                  Lurked in those bitter gibes. A dangerous foe
                  Were D’Alba. Julian, the sea breeze to thee
                  Brings health, and strength, and joy. I have an errand
                  As far as Madrid. None so well as thou
                  Can bid it speed. There shalt away to day;—
                  ’Tis thy best medicine;—thou and thy young wife.
                  The wind is fair.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  To day!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Have I not said?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Send me just risen from a sick couch to Madrid!
                  Send me from home, from thee! Banish me! Father,
                  Canst thou not bear my sight?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I cannot bear
                  
                  Contention. Must I needs remind thee, Julian,
                  I have also been ill?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’ll go to day.
                  How pale he is! I had not dared before
                  To look upon his face. I’ll go to day.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  This very hour?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  This very hour.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  My son!
                  Now call thy—yet a moment. Where’s the boy—
                  He shall aboard with thee—thy pretty page?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The King? Mean’st thou the King?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  He, whom thou call’st—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Wilt thou not say the King?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Young Theodore.
                  Hearken, Prince Julian! I am glad, right glad
                  Of what hath chanced. ’Twas well to bring him hither,
                  
                  And keep him at thy side. He shall away
                  To Spain with thee, that Theodore—Forget
                  All other titles. He’ll be glad of this.
                  A favourite page, a spoilt and petted boy,
                  To lie in summer gardens, in the shade
                  Of orange groves, whose pearly blossoms fall
                  Amidst his clustering curls, and to his lute
                  Sing tenderest ditties,—such his happy lot;
                  Whilst I—Go, bring thy wife.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He is the King.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Call lady Annabel.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The King, I say,
                  The rightful King, the only King! I’ll shed
                  The last drop in my veins for King Alfonso.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Once I forgave thee. But to beard me thus,
                  And for a weak and peevish youth, a faintling,
                  A boy of a girl’s temper; one who shrinks
                  Trembling and crouching at a look, a word,
                  
                  A lifted finger, like a beaten hound.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Alas! poor boy! he hath no other friend
                  Since thou, who should’st defend him,—Father, Father,
                  Three months have scarcely passed since thy dear brother,
                  (Oh, surely thou lovedst him!) with the last words
                  He ever spake, besought thy guardian care
                  Of his fair child. Next upon me he turned
                  His dying eyes, quite speechless then, and thou—
                  I could not speak, for poor Alfonso threw
                  Himself upon my breast, with such a
							gush
                  Of natural grief, I had no utterance—
                  But thou didst vow for both protection, faith,
                  Allegiance; thou didst swear so fervently,
                  So deeply, that the spirit flew to Heaven
                  Smiling. I’ll keep that oath.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Even if again thy sword—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Urge not that thought on me. ’Tis a fire
                  Here in my heart, my brain. Bethink thee, Father,
                  Soldier or statesman, thine is the first name
                  
                  Of Sicily, the General, Regent, Prince,
                  The unmatch’d in power, the unapproach’d in fame;
                  What could that little word a King do more
                  For thee?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  That little word! Why that is fame,
                  And power and glory! That shall fill the world,
                  Lend a whole age its name, and float along
                  The stream of time, with such a buoyancy,
                  As shall endure when palaces and tombs
                  Are swept away like dust. That little word!
                  Beshrew thy womanish heart that cannot feel
                  Its spell!
                  Guns and shouts are heard without.
                  Hark! Hark! The guns! I feel it now.
                  I am proclaimed. Before I entered here
                  ’Twas known throughout the city that I lived,
                  And the boy-king was dead. 
                  Guns, bells, and shouts again.
                  Hark, King Rugiero!
                  Dost hear the bells, the shouts? Oh ’tis a
						            	proud
                  And glorious feeling thus at once to live
                  Within a thousand bounding hearts, to hear
                  The strong out-gushing of that present fame
                  
                  For whose uncertain dim futurity
                  Men toil, and slay, and die! Without a crime—
                  I thank thee still for that—Without a crime—
                  For he’ll be happier—I am a King.
                  Shouts again.
                  Dost thou not hear Long live the King Rugiero?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The shout is weak.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Augment it by thy voice.
                  Would the words choak Prince Julian? Cannot he
                  Wish long life to his Father?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Live, my Father!
                  Long live the Duke of Melfi!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Live the King!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Long live the King Alfonso!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Now, by Heaven,
                  Thou art still brainsick. There is a contagion
                  In the soft dreamy nature of that child,
                  That thou, a soldier—I was overproud
                  Of thee and thy young fame. That lofty brow
                  
                  Seem’d form’d to wear a crown. Chiefly for thee—
                  Where is the Page?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Oh Father, once
							again
                  Take pity on us all! For me! For me!
                  Thou hast always been to me the kindest, fondest—
                  Preventing all my wishes— I’ll not reason,
                  I’ll not contend with thee. Here at thy feet,
                  Prostrate in spirit as in form, I cry
                  For mercy! Save me from despair! from sin!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Unmanly,  rise! lest in that slavish posture
                  I treat thee as a slave.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Strike an thou wilt,
                  Thy words pierce deeper, to the very core!
                  Strike an thou wilt; but hear me. Oh my Father,
                  I do conjure thee, by that name, by all
                  The boundless love it guerdons, spare my soul
                  This bitterness!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I’ll reign.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Aye, reign indeed;
                  Rule over mightier realms; be conqueror
                  Of crowned passions; king of thy own mind.
                  I’ve ever loved thee as a son,, do this
                  And I shall worship thee. I will cling to thee;
                  Thou shalt not shake me off.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Go to; thou art mad.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Not yet; but thou may’st make me so.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I’ll make thee
                  The heir of a fair crown.
               
               
                  Julian. 
                  Not all the powers
                  Of all the earth can force upon my brow
                  That heritage of guilt. Cannot I die?
                  But that were happiness. I’d rather drag
                  A weary life beneath the silent rule
                  Of the stern Trappist, digging my own grave,
                  Myself a living corse, cut off from the sweet
                  And natural kindness that man shews to man;
                  I’d rather hang, a hermit, on the steep
                  
                  Of horrid Etna, between snow and fire;
                  Rather than sita crown’d and honour’d prince
                  Guarded by children, tributaries, friends,
                  On an usurper’s throne.
               
               Guns without.
               
                  Melfi.
                  I must away.
                  We’ll talk of this anon. Where is the
							boy.
               
               
                  Julian. 
                  Safe.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Trifle not with my impatience, Julian;
                  Produce the child. Howe’er thou may deny
                  Allegiance to the king, obey thy father.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I had a father.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  But he gave up
                  Faith, loyalty, and honour, and pure fame,
                  And his own son.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  My son!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I loved him once,
                  And dearly. Still too dearly! But with all
                  That burning, aching, passionate old love
                  
                  Wrestling within my breast; even face to face;
                  Those eyes upon me; and that trembling hand
                  Thrilling my very heartstrings—Take it off!
                  In mercy, take it off!--Still I renounce thee.
                  Thou hast no son. I have no father. Go
                  Down to a childless grave.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Even from the grave
                  A father’s curse may reach thee, clinging to thee
                  Cold as a dead man’s shroud, shadowing thy days,
                  Haunting thy dreams, and hanging, a thick
						            	cloud,
                  ’Twixt thee and Heaven. Then, when perchance thine own
                  Small prattling pretty ones shall climb thy knee
                  And bid thee bless them, think of thy dead father,
                  And groan as thou dost now.
                  Guns again.
                  Hark! ’tis the hour!
                  I must away. Back to thy chamber, son,
                  And chuse if I shall curse thee. 
               
               Exit Melfi.
               
                  Julian.
                  
                  Did he curse me?
                  Did he? Am I that withered, blasted wretch?
                  Is that the fire that burns my brain? Not yet!
                  Oh, do not curse me yet! He’s gone. The boy!
                  The boy!
               
               Rushes out.
               END OF THE SECOND ACT
            
         
         
         
            ACT III
            
               SCENE.
               A Magnificent Cathedral. A Gothic Monument in the Foreground, with Steps round it, and the Figure of an old Warrior on the top.
               D’Alba, Leanti, Valore, Calvi, and other nobles.
               
                  Calvi.
                  Where stays the King?
               
               
                  Leanti
                  He’s robing to assume
                  The Crown.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  What a gloom reigns in the Cathedral!
                  Where are the people, who should make and grace
                  This pageant?
               
               
                  Valore.
                  ’Tis too sudden.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Saw ye not
                  How coldly, as the slow procession moved,
                  Men’s eyes were fixed upon him? Silently
                  We passed amid dull silence. I could hear
                  The chink of money, which the heralds flung,
                  Reverberate on the pavement. They, who stooped
                  To gather up the coin, looked on the impress
                  Of young Alfonso, sighed and shook their heads
                  
                  As ’twere his funeral.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  Methinks this place
                  The general tomb of his high line doth cry
                  Shame on us! The mute citizens do mourn him
                  Better than we.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  Therefore the gates are closed,
                  And none but peers of Sicily may pass
                  The guarded doors.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Where is Prince Julian?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Sick
                  Here comes the Mighty One, and the great Prelates
                  That shall anoint his haughty brow; ’tis bent
                  With a stern joy.
               
               Enter Melfi, in Royal Robes, preceded by Nobles,
								Officers, &c. bearing the Crown, Archbishop, Bishops,
								&c.
               
                  Melfi.
                  No! To no tapered shrine.
                  Here, reverend Fathers, here! This is my altar:
                  The tomb of my great ancestor, who first
                  Won from the Paynim this Sicilian crown,
                  And wore it gloriously; whose name I bear
                  
                  As I will bear his honour’d sceptre. Here,
                  At this most kingly altar, will I plight
                  My vow to Sicily, the nuptial vow
                  That links my fate to her’s. Here I’ll receive
                  Her Barons’ answering faith. Hear me, thou shade
                  Of great Rugiero, whilst I swear to guard
                  With heart and hand the realm thy valour won,
                  The laws thy wisdom framed—brave legacy
                  To prince and people! to defend their rights,
                  To rule in truth and justice, peacefully,
                  If peace may be; and with the awful arm
                  Of lawful power to sweep the oppressor off
                  From thy blest Isle; to be the Peasants’ King—
                  Nobles, hear that!--the Peasants’ King and yours!
                  Look down, Ancestral Spirit, on my oath,
                  And sanctify and bless it! Now the crown.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  What noise is that at the gate?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Crown me, I say.
               
               
                  Archb.
                  ’Tis fallen! Save us from the ill omen!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Save us
                  From thy dull hands, old dotard! Thou a Priest,
                  And tremble at the touch of power! Give me
                  The crown.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  It fits thee not.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Give me the crown,
                  And with a steady grasp it shall endue
                  These throbbing brows that burn till they are bound
                  With that bright diadem.
                  
                  Enter Julian and Alfonso.
               
               
                  Julian
                  Stop. Place it here!
                  This is the King! the real, the only King!
                  The living King Alfonso!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Out, foul traitor!
                  ’Tis an impostor.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Look on him, Count D’Alba!
                  Calvi, Valore, look! Ye know him well.
                  And ye that never saw him, know ye not
                  His father’s lineaments? Remove thy hand
                  From that fair forehead. ’Tis the pallid brow
                  Bent with pensiveness, the dropping eyelid,
                  The womanish changing cheek—his very self!
                  Look on him. Do ye know him? Do ye own
                  Your King?
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  ’Tis he.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  The boy
							himself!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Now place
                  
                  The crown upon his head; and hear me swear
                  Low at his feet, as subject, kinsman, Prince,
                  Allegiance.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Rise, dear Cousin.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Father, kneel,
                  Kneel here with me thou, his first subject, thou
                  The guardian of the state, kneel first, and vow
                  Thy princely fealty.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Hence, abject slave!
                  And thou, young minion—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  to Alf.
                  Fear not. Father, kneel!
                  Look where thou art. This is no place, my lord,
                  To dally with thy duty: underneath
                  Thy fathers’ sleep; above their banners wave
                  Heavily. Death is round about us. Death
                  And Fame. Have they no voice for thee? Not one,
                  Of one long storied line but lived and died
                  A pure and faithful Knight, and left his son
                  Honour—proud heritage! I am thine heir,
                  And I demand that bright inheritance
                  Unstained, undimmed. Kneel, I implore thee! I,
                  Thy son.
               
               
                  Melfi
                  Off, cursed viper!
                  Off, ere I hurl thee on the stones!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’ve done
                  My duty. Was it not my duty?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Julian,
                  Sit here by me; here on the
							steps.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  Again
                  We must demand of thee, my Lord of Melfi,
                  How chanced this tale of murder? Here’s our Prince,
                  Safe and unhurt. But where’s the Assassin? Where
                  The regicide? Where he that wounded thee?
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Pointing to Julian
                  Demand of him.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Where be these murderers?
                  Art sure thou saw’st them, Duke? Or was’t a freak
                  Of the deft Fay Morgana? Didst thou
							feel
                  The trenchant blade? Or, was the hurt thou talk’st of
                  A fairy wound, a phantasm? Once again
                  I warn thee, speak.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Demand Prince Julian, Sir,
                  This work is his.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He speaks not. Little King,
                  What say’st thou?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Julian saved me.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Saved! From whom?
                  From what!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  A king should have no memory
                  But for good deeds. My lords, an it so please you,
                  We’ll to the Palace. I’ll not wear to-day
                  This crown. Some fitting season; but not now.
                  I’m weary. Let us home.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Aye, take him hence.
                  Home with him, Count Valore. Stay by him
                  Till I come to ye. Leave him not. Nay, Calvi,
                  Remain. Hence with the boy.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  My Cousin Julian,
                  Wilt thou not go with us?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’ve done my duty.
                  Was’t not my duty? But look there! look there!
                  I cannot go with thee. I am his now.
                  All his.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Uncle—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Away, bright spotted worm—
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  What, ho! the guard!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  My lord, where Julian is
                  I need no guard. Question no more of this,
                  But follow us.
                  Exeunt Alfonso, Valore, and other nobles.
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I do contemn myself
                  That I hold silence. Warriors, kinsmen, friends,
                  Barons of Sicily, the valiant princes
                  Of this most fertile and thrice famous Isle,
                  Hear me! What yonder crafty Count hath dared,
                  With subtle question and
					          		derisive smile,
                  To slide into a meaning, is as true
                  As he is false. I would be King; I’d reign
                  Over fair Sicily; I’d call myself
                  Your Sovereign, Princes; thine, Count D’Alba, thine,
                  Calvi, and old Leanti—we were comrades
                  Many a year in the rough path of war.
                  And now ye know me all. I’ll be a King
                  Fit for this warlike nation, which brooks sway
                  Only of men. Yon slight fair boy is born
                  With a woman’s heart. Let him go tell his beads
                  For us and for our kingdom, I’ll be King.
                  I’ll lend unto that title such a name,
                  As shall enchase this bauble with one blaze
                  Of honour. I’ll lead on to glory, lords,
                  And ye shall shine in the brightness of my fame
                  
                  As planets round the sun. What say ye?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Never!
               
               
                  Calvi, &c.
                  Never!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Say thou, Leanti, thou’rt a soldier
                  Worthy of the name,—a brave one! What say’st thou?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  If young Alfonso—
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Peace. Why this is well.
                  This morning I received a tale—I’m not
                  An over-believer in man’s excellence;
                  I know that in this slippery path of life
                  The firmest foot may fail; that there have been
                  Ere now ambitious generals, grasping heirs,
                  Unnatural kinsmen, foul usurpers, murderers!--
                  I know that man is frail, and might have fallen
                  Tho’ Eve had never lived,—Albeit I own
                  The smiling mischief’s potency. But this,
                  This tale was made up of such several sins,
                  All of them devilish, treason, treachery,
                  
                  And pitiless cruelty made murder pale
                  With their red shame,—I doubt not readily
                  When man and guilt are joined—but this the common
                  And general sympathy that links our kind
                  Forbade to believe. Yet now before ye all,
                  His peers and mine, before the vacant throne
                  He sought to usurp, before the crown that fell
                  As conscious from his brow, I do arraign
                  Rugiero, Duke of Melfi, General, Peer,
                  Regent and Prince, of Treason.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Treason! D’Alba.
                  We quarrel not for words. Let these but follow
                  And bold emprise shall bear a happier name.
                  Sicilians, have ye lost your Island spirit?
                  Barons, is your ancient bravery tamed down
                  By this vain scoffer? I’ll to the people. They
                  Love their old soldier.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Stop. Duke, I arraign thee
                  Of murder; planned, designed, attempted murder,
                  Though incomplete, on the thrice sacred person
                  
                  Of young Alfonso, kinsman, ward, and King.
                  Wilt thou defend this too? Was’t a brave deed
                  To draw the assassin’s sword on that poor child?
                  Seize him!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Come near who dares! Where be thy proofs?
                  Where be thy witnesses?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  There’s one. Prince Julian,
                  Rouse thee!He sits erect and motionless
                  As yon ancestral image. Doth he breathe?
                  Rouse thee, and answer, as before thy God,
                  As there is truth in Heaven. Didst thou not see
                  Thy father’s sword at young Alfonso’s breast?
                  Lay not the boy, already dead with fear,
                  At his false guardian’s feet? Answer!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Aye, speak,
                  Prince Julian! Dost thou falter now? On, on,
                  And drive the dagger home! On, on, I say.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  We wait your Highness’ answer.
                  
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Which among ye
                  Dares question me? What are ye, Sirs?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  The States of Sicily.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The States! Without a head!
                  Without a King! Without a Regent! States!
                  The States! Are ye the States that ’gainst all form
                  Of justice or of guardian law drive on
                  To bloody trial, him your Greatest? Here, too!
                  Here! Will ye build up scaffolds in your churches?
                  And turn grave priests to beadsmen? I’ll not answer.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  The rack may force thee.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He but smiles. Convey
                  The Duke to the Hall of Justice. We shall follow.
                  Go summon Juan Castro thither. Hence!
                  Why loiter ye?
               
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  A word with thee, Prince Julian.
                  I pray ye, listen, ’tis no treason, lords.
                  I would but say, finish thy work. Play well
                  The part that thou hast chosen. Cast aside
                  All filial yearnings. Be a gallant foe.
                  Rush onward through the fight. Trample me down.
                  Tread on my neck. Be perfect in that quality
                  Which thou call’st justice. Quell thy womanish weakness.
                  Let me respect the enemy, whom once
                  I thought my Son.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Once, Father!
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I’m no Father!
                  Rouse not my soul to curse thee! Tempt me not
                  To curse thy Mother—She whom once I deemed
                  A saint in purity; Be resolute,
                  Falter not with them. Lie not.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Did I ever?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Finish thy work. On, soldiers!
                  Exit Melfi, guarded.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Answer, Prince!
                  The Duke, as thou hast heard, disclaims thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Dare not
                  A man of ye say that. I am his son—
                  Tremble lest my sword should prove me so;—a part
                  Of his own being. He gave me this life,
                  These senses, these affections. The quick blood
                  That knocks so strongly at my heart is his—
                  Would I might spill it for him! Had ye no fathers,
                  Have ye no sons, that ye would train men up
                  In parricide? I will not answer ye.
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  This passion is thy answer. Could’st thou say
                  No; in that simple word were more comprised
                  Than in a world of fiery eloquence.
                  Canst thou not utter No? ’Tis short and easy,
                  The first sound that a stuttering babe will lisp
                  To his fond nurse,—yet thy tongue stammers at it!
                  I ask him if his father be at once
                  Traitor and Murderer, and he cannot say,
                  No!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Subtle blood-thirsty fiend! I’ll answer
                  To nought that thou canst ask. Murderer! The king
                  Lives. Seek of him. One truth I’ll tell thee, D’Alba,
                  And then the record of that night shall pass
                  Down to the grave in silence. But one sword
                  Was stained with blood in yonder glen—’twas mine!
                  I am the only guilty. This I swear
                  Before the all-seeing God, whose quenchless gaze
                  Pierced through that twilight hour. Now condemn
                  The Duke of Melfi an ye dare! I’ll speak
                  No more on this foul question.
                  
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Thou the guilty?
                  Thou!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I have said it.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  I had heard a tale—
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  This must be sifted.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  In that twilight hour
                  A mortal eye beheld them. An old Spaniard,
                  One of the guard—By Heaven it is a tale
                  So bloody, so unnatural, man may scarce
                  Believe it!
               
               
                  Leanti
                  And the king still lives.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  Why, ’tis
                  A mystery. Let’s to the Hall of Justice
                  And hear this soldier. Sir, they are ambitious,
                  Father & son—We can pass judgment there,
                  This is no place;—Leanti, more ambitious
                  Than thou canst guess.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Aye, by a thousand fold!
                  I am an eaglet born, and can drink in
                  The sunlight, when the blinking owls go darkling,
                  Dazzled and blinded by the day. Ambitious!
                  I have had day dreams would have shamed the visions
                  Of that great Master of the world, who wept
                  For other worlds to conquer. I’d have lived
                  An age of sinless glory, and gone down
                  Storied and epitaphed and chronicled,
                  To the very end of time. Now—But I still
                  May suffer bravely, may die as a Prince,
                  A Man. Ye go to judgment. Lords, remember
                  I am the only guilty.
               
               
                  Calvi
                  We must needs
                  On such confession, give you into charge
                  A prisoner. Ho! Captain.
               
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Goes he with us?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  No; for the hall is near, and they are best
                  
                  Questioned apart. Walk by me, good Leanti,
                  And I will shew thee why.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Is’t possible
                  That Julian stabb’d his father?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  No. Thou saw’st
                  They met as friends; no! no!
                  Exeunt Calvi and other Lords
                  Enter Annabel .
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Where is he? Where?
                  Julian!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Fair Princess—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Stay me not. My Julian!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Oh, how she sinks her head upon his arm!
                  How her curls kiss his cheek! and her white hand
                  Lies upon his! The cold and sluggish husband!
                  He doth not clasp that loveliest hand, which nature
                  Fashioned to gather roses, or to hold
                  Bunches of bursting grapes.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Count D’Alba, see,
                  We are alone. Wilt thou not come?
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Anon.
                  Now he hath seized her hand, hath dared to grasp,
                  He shall not hold it long.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  They’ll wait us, Count.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  That white hand shall be mine.
                  Exeunt D’Alba and Leanti
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My Annabel,
                  Why art thou here?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  They said—I was a fool
                  That believed them!—Constance said she heard a cry,
                  Down with the Melfi! and the rumour ran
                  That there had been a fray, that thou wast slain.
                  But thou art safe, my Julian?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  As thou seest.
                  Thou art breathless still.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Aye. I flew through the streets,
                  Piercing the crowds like light. I was a fool;
                  But thou had’st left me on a sudden, bearing
                  
                  The young Alfonso with thee, high resolve
                  Fixed in thine eye. I knew not—Love is
									fearful;
                  And I have learnt to fear.
                  
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Thou tremblest still.
               
               
                  Annabel.
                  The Church is cold and lonely; and that seat,
                  At the foot of yon grim warrior, all too damp
                  For thee. I like not thus to see thee, Julian,
                  Upon a tomb. Thou must submit thee still
                  To thy poor nurse. Home! By the way thou’lt tell
									me
                  What hath befallen. Where is Alfonso?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Say
                  The King! the rightful, the acknowledged King!
                  Annabel, this rude stone’s effigy
                  Of the founder of our line; the gallant chief
                  Who swept away the Saracen, and quelled
                  Fierce civil broils; and, when the people’s choice
                  Crowned him, lived guardian of their rights, and died
                  Wept by them as a father. And methinks
                  To-day I do not shame my ancestor;
                  I dare to sit here at his feet, and feel
                  He would not spurn his son. Thou dost not grieve
                  To lose a crown, my fairest?
                  
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh no! no!
                  I’m only proud of thee. Thy fame’s my crown.
                  
                  
               
               
                  Jul.
                  Not fame but conscience is the enduring crown,
                  And wearing that impearled, why to lose fame
                  Or life were nothing.
               
               
                  Ann.
                  Where’s thy father, Julian?
                  Forgive me, I have pained thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  No. The pang
                  Is mastered. Where? He is a prisoner
                  Before the States. I am a prisoner here.
                  These are my guards. Be calmer, Sweetest. Rend not
                  This holy place with shrieks.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  They seek thy life!
                  They’ll sentence thee! They’ll kill thee! No! they shall not,
                  Unless they kill me first. What crime—O God,
                  
                  
                  To talk of crime and thee!--What falsest
						            	charge
                  Dare they to bring?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Somewhat of yon sad night
                  They know.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Where’s Theodore? The page? The King?
                  Doth he accuse thee too?
                  
               
               
                  Jul.
                  Poor gentle Cousin!
                  He is as innocent as thou.
               
               
                  Ann.
                  I’ll fetch him.
                  We’ll go together to the States. We’ll save thee.
                  We, feeble though we be, woman and boy,
                  We’ll save thee. Hold me not!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Where would’st thou go?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  To the States.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  And there?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  I’ll tell the truth, the truth,
                  The irresistible truth! Let go. A moment
                  May cost thy life,—our lives. Nothing but truth,
                  That’s all thy cause can need. Let go.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  And he,
                  My father?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  What’s a thousand such as he,
                  To thee, my husband! But he shall be safe.
                  He is thy father. I’ll say nought can harm him.
                  He was ever kind to me! I’ll pray for him.
                  
                  Nay, an thou fear’st me, Julian, I’ll not speak
                  One word; I’ll only kneel before them all,
                  Lift up my hands, and pray in my inmost heart,
                  As I pray to God.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My loving wife, to Him
                  Pray, to Him only. Leave me not, my dearest;
                  There is a peace around us in this pause,
                  This interval of torture. I’m content
                  And strong to suffer. Be thou—
                  Enter D’Alba, Calvi, Leanti and Nobles
                  Ha! returned
                  Already! This is quick. But I’m prepared.
                  The sentence!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Tell it not! Ye are his Judges.
                  Ye have the power of life and death. Your words
                  Are fate. Oh speak not yet! Listen to me.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Aye; a long summer day! What would’st thou?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Save him!
                  Save him!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He shall not die.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Now bless thee, D’Alba!
                  Bless thee! He’s safe! He’s free!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Once more I ask
                  His doom, for that is mine. If ye have dared,
                  In mockery of justice, to arraign
                  And sentence your great Ruler, with less pause
                  Than a petty thief taken in the manner, what’s
                  Our doom?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Sir, our great ruler (we that love not
                  Law’s tedious circumstance may thank him) spared
                  All trial by confession. He avowed
                  Treason and regicide; and all that thou
                  Hadst said or might say, he avouched unheard
                  For truth, then cried; as thou hast done, for judgment,
                  For death.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I can die too.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  A milder doom
                  Unites ye. We have spared the royal blood.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Only the blood. Estates and honours all
                  Are forfeit to the King; the assembled states
                  Banish ye; the most holy Church declares ye
                  Beneath her ban. This is your sentence, Sir.
                  A Herald waits to read it in the streets
                  
                  Before ye, and from out the city gate
                  To thrust ye, outlawed, excommunicate,
                  Infamous amongst men. Ere noon to-morrow
                  Ye must depart from Sicily; on pain
                  Of death to ye the outlaws, death to all
                  That harbour ye, death to whoe’er shall give
                  Food, shelter, comfort, speech. So pass ye forth
                  In infamy!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Eternal infamy
                  Rest on your heads, false judges! Outlawed! Banished!
                  Bereft of all state and title! Thou art still
                  Best of the good, greatest amongst the great,
                  My Julian! Must they die that give thee food
                  And rest and comfort? I shall comfort thee,
                  I thy true wife! I’ll never leave thee. Never!
                  We’ll walk together to the gate, my hand
                  In thine, as lovers. Let’s set forth. We’ll go
                  Together.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Aye; but not to-night. I’ll meet thee
                  To-morrow at the harbour.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  No! no! no!
                  
                  I will not leave thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Cling not thus. She trembles.
                  She cannot walk. Brave Sir, we have been comrades;
                  There is a pity in thine eye, which well
                  Beseems a soldier. Take this weeping lady
                  To King Alfonso. Tell the royal boy
                  One, who was once his Cousin and his friend,
                  Commends her to him. Go. To-morrow, dearest,
                  We’ll meet again. Now for the sentence. Lords,
                  I question not your power. I submit
                  To all, even to this shame. Be quick! be quick!
               
               Exeunt.
               END OF THE THIRD ACT.
               
            
         
         
            ACT IV.
            
               Scene 1
               An Apartment in the Royal Palace.
               D’Alba, Bertone.
               
                  D’Alba.
                  I’ve parted them at last. The livelong night
                  The little King lay, like a page, before
                  Her chamber door; and ever as he heard
                  A struggling sigh within, he cried, alas!
                  And echoed back her moan, and uttered words
                  Of comfort. Happy boy.
               
               
                  Bert.
                  But he is gone
                  Towards the gate: be sure to meet Prince Julian.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  For that I care not, so that I secure
                  The vision that once flitted from my grasp
                  And vanished like a rainbow.
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Yet is Julian
                  Still dangerous.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Why after noon to-day—
                  And see the sun’s already high!--he dies
                  If he be found in Sicily. Take thou
                  Two resolute comrades to pursue his steps,
                  
                  Soon as the time be past. Didst thou not hear
                  The proclamation? Know’st thou where he bides?
                  And Melfi?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Good, my lord, ’tis said the Duke
                  Is dead.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Dead!
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Certain ’tis that yesternight
                  He walked from out the Judgment Hall like one
                  Dreaming, with eyes that saw not, ears that heard
                  No sound, staggering and tottering like old age
                  Or infancy. And when the kingly robe
                  Was plucked from him, and he forced from the gate,
                  A deep wound in his side burst forth; the blood
                  Welled like a fountain.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  And he died?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  He fell
                  Fainting; and Julian, who had tended him
                  Silently, with a spirit so absorbed
                  His own shame seemed unfelt, fell on his neck
                  Shrieking like maddening woman. There we left him,
                  
                  And there ’tis said he hath outwatched the night.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  There on the ground?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  So please you.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Thou hast known
                  A softer couch, Prince Julian. Is the litter
                  Prepared? And the old groom?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  My lord, he waits
                  Your pleasure.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Call him hither.
                  Exit Bertone.
                  Blood welled out
                  From a deep wound! Said old Leanti sooth?
                  No matter! Either way he’s guilty.
                  Re-enter Bertone with Renzi.
                  Ha!
                  A reverend knave. Wast thou Prince Julian’s huntsman?
               
               
                  Renzi.
                  An please you, Sir, I was.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Dost know the Princess?—
                  Doth she know thee?
               
               
                  Renzi.
                  Full well, my Lord. I tended
                  Prince Julian’s favourite greyhound. It was strange
                  How Lelia loved my lady,—the poor fool
                  Hath pined for her this week past,—and my lady
                  Loved Lelia. She would stroke her glossy head,
                  And talk of Lelia’s beauty, Lelia’s speed,
                  Till I was weary.
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  And the angel deemed
                  This slave as faithful as her dog! The better.
                  Dost thou love ducats, Renzi?
                  Tossing him a purse.
                  Canst thou grace
                  A lie with tongue and look and action?
               
               
                  Renzi.
                  Aye.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Go to the Princess; say thy master sent
							thee
                  To guide her to him, or the young Alfonso,—
                  Use either name, or both. Spare not for tears,
                  Or curses. Lead her to the litter; see
                  That Constance follows not. Bertone’ll gain
                  Admittance for thee—Go.
                  Exit Renzi.
                  Bertone seek me
                  A supple churchman;—Know’st thou any? One
                  Not scrupulous; one who loves gold, and laughs
                  At conscience. Bring him to me. I must hasten
                  Silently home. Let not the Princess guess
                  That I have left the palace.
               
               
                  Bert.
                  No, my Lord.
               
               Exeunt severally.
               
            
            
               SCENE II
               The Country just without the gates of Messina. A hilly back Ground.
               Melfi, lying on the Stage, Julian.
               
                  Julian.
                  He wakes! He is not dead! I am not yet
                  A parricide. I dare not look on him;
                  I dare not speak.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Water! my throat is scorched.
                  Exit Julian.
                  My tongue cleaves to my mouth. Water! Will none
                  
                  
                  Go fetch me water? Am I here alone?
                  Here on the bloody ground, as on that night—
                  Am I there still? No! I remember now.
                  Yesterday I was King; to-day, I’m nothing;
                  Cast down by my own son; stabbed in my fame;
                  Branded and done to death; an outlaw where
                  I ruled! He, whom I loved with such a pride,
                  With such a fondness, hath done this; and I,
                  I have not strength to drag me to his presence
                  That I might rain down curses on his head,
                  Might blast him with a look.
               
               
               Enter Julian.
               
                  Julian.
                  Here’s water. Drink!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What voice is that? Why dost thou shroud thy face?
                  Dost shame to shew thyself? Who art thou?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Drink.
                  I pray thee drink.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Is’t poison?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  ’Tis the pure
                  And limpid gushing of a natural spring
                  Close by yon olive ground. A little child,
                  Who stood beside the fount, watching the bright
                  And many-coloured pebbles, as they seemed
                  To dance in the bubling water, filled for me
                  Her beechen cup, with her small innocent hand,
                  And bade our Lady bless the draught! Oh drink!
                  Have faith in such a blessing!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Thou should’st bring
                  Nothing but poison. Hence, accursed cup!
                  
                  I’ll perish in my thirst. I know thee, Sir.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Father!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I have no son. I had one once,
                  
                  A gallant gentleman; but he—What, Sir,
                  Didst thou never hear of that Sicilian Prince,
                  Who made the fabulous tale of Greece a truth,
                  And slew his father? The old Laius fell
                  At once, unknowing and unknown; but this
                  New Œdipus, he stabbed and stabbed and stabbed,
                  And the poor wretch cannot die.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I think my heart
                  Is iron that it breaks not.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I should curse him—
                  And yet—Dost thou not know that I’m an outlaw,
                  Under the ban? They stand in danger, Sir,
                  That talk to me.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I am an outlaw too.
                  Thy fate is mine. Our sentence is alike.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What! have they banished thee?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I should have gone,
                  In very truth, I should have gone with thee,
                  Aye to the end of the world.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What banish thee!
                  Oh, foul ingratitude! Weak changeling boy!
               
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He knows it not. Father, this banishment
                  Came as a comfort to me, set me free
                  From warring duties and fatiguing cares,
                  And left me wholly thine. We shall be happy;
                  For she goes with us, who will prop thy steps,
                  As once the maid of Thebes, Antigone,
                  In that old tale. Chuse thou whatever land,—
                  All are alike to us. But pardon me!
                  Say thou hast pardoned me!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  My virtuous son!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Oh thanks to thee and Heaven! He sinks; he’s faint;
                  His lips wax pale. I’ll seek the spring once more:
                  ’Tis thirst.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What music’s that?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I hear none.
               
               
                  Melfi
                  Hark!
               
               
                  Julian
                  Thou art weak and dizzy.
               
               
                  Melfi
                  Angels of the air,
                  Cherub and Seraph sometimes watch around
                  The dying, and the mortal sense, at pause
                  ’Twixt life and death, doth drink in a faint echo
                  Of heavenly harpings?
               
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I have heard so.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Aye;
                  But they were just men, Julian! They were holy.
                  They were not traitors.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Strive against these thoughts—
                  Thou wast a brave man, Father!--fight against them,
                  As ’gainst the Paynims thy old foes. He grows
                  Paler and paler. Water from the spring;
                  Or generous wine;—I saw a cottage near.
                  Rest thee, dear Father, till I come.
               
               Exit Julian.
               
                  Melfi.
                  Again
                  That music! It is mortal; it draws nearer.
                  No. But if men should pass, must I lie here
                  Like a crushed adder? Here in the highway
                  Trampled beneath their feet?—So! So! I’ll crawl
                  To yonder bank. Oh that it were the deck
                  Of some great Admiral, and I alone
                  Boarding amidst a hundred swords! the breach
                  Of some strong citadel, and I the first
                  
                  To mount in the cannon’s mouth! I was brave once.
                  Oh for the common undistinguished death
                  Of battle, pressed by horse’s heels, or crushed
                  By falling towers! And thing but to lie
                  Here like a leper!
               
               Enter Alfonso, Valore, and Calvi.
               
                  Alfon.
                  ’Tis the spot where Julian—
                  And yet I see him not. I’ll pause awhile;
                  ’Tis likely he’ll return. I’ll wait.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  My liege,
                  You’re sad to day.
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  I have good cause to be so.
               
               
                  Valore.
                  Nay, nay, cheer up.
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  Didst thou not tell me, Sir,
                  That my poor Uncle’s banished, outlawed, laid
                  Under the church’s ban?
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  He would have slain
                  His Sovereign.
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  I ne’er said it. Yesterday
                  I found you at his feet. Oh, would to Heaven
                  That crown were on his head, and I—What’s that?
               
               
                  Valore.
                  The moaning wind.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  He was a traitor, Sire,
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  He was my kinsman still. And Julian! Julian!
                  My Cousin Julian! he who saved my life,
                  Whose only crime it was to be too good,
                  Too great, too well beloved,—to banish him!
                  To tear him from my arms!
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  Sire, he confessed—
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  Ye should have questioned me. Sirs, I’m a boy,
                  A powerless, friendless boy, whose name is used
                  To cover foul oppression. If I live
                  To grasp a sword—but ye will break my heart
                  Before that hour. Whence come those groans?
										Seeing Melfi. My Uncle
                  
                  Stretched on the ground, and none to tend thee! Rest
                  Thy head upon my arm. Where’s Julian? Sure
                  I thought to find him with thee. Nay, be still;
                  Strive not to move.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I fain would kneel to thee
                  For pardon.
               
               
                  Calvi
                  Listen not, my liege. The States
                  Sentenced the Duke of Melfi; thou hast not
                  The power to pardon. Leave him to his fate.
               
               
                  Valore.
                  ’Twere best your Highness came with us.
                  
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Avoid
                  The place! Leave us, cold, courtly lords! Avoid
                  My sight! Leave us, I say. Send instant succour,
                  Food, water, wine, and men with hearts, if courts
                  May breed such. Leave us.
               
               Exeunt Calvi and Valore.
               
                  Melfi.
                  Gallant boy!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Alas!
                  I have no power.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  For all I need thou hast.
                  Give me but six feet of Sicilian earth,
                  And thy sweet pardon.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Talk not thus. I’ll grow
                  At once into a man, into a king,
                  And they shall tremble, and turn pale with fear.
                  Who now have dared—
                  Enter Julian.
                  Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Here’s water. Ha!
                  Alfonso! I thought Pity had been dead.
                  
                  I craved a little wine, for the dear love
                  Of Heaven, for a poor dying man; and all
                  Turned from my prayer. Drink, 
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I have sent
                  For succour.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Gentle heart!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  The time is past.
                  Music again.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Aye; ’tis a shepherd’s pipe
                  From yonder craggy mountain. How it swings
                  Upon the wind, now pausing, now renewed,
                  Regular as a bell.
               
               
                  Melf.
                  A passing bell.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Cast off these heavy thoughts.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Turn me.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  He bleeds!
                  The blood wells out.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  It eases me.
               
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He sinks!
                  He dies! Off! he’s my father. Rest on me.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Bless thee.
               
               
                  Julian
                  Oh, no! no! no! I cannot bear
                  Thy blessing. Twice to stab, and twice forgiven—
                  Oh curse me rather!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Bless ye both!
                  Dies.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  He’s dead,
                  And surely he died penitent. That thought
                  Hath in it a deep comfort. The freed spirit
                  Gushed out in a full tide of pardoning love.
                  He blest us both, my Julian; even me
                  As I had been his son. We’ll pray for him
                  Together, and thy Annabel shall join
                  Her purest orisons. I left her stretched
                  In a deep slumber. All night long she watched
                  And wept for him and thee; but now she sleeps.
                  Shall I go fetch her? She, better than I,
                  
                  Would soothe thee. Dost thou hear? He writhes as though
                  The struggling grief would choke him. Rouse thee. Julian,
                  Calm thee. Thou frighten’st me.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Am I not calm?
                  There is my sword. Go.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I’ll not leave thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  King!
                  Dost thou not see we’ve killed him? Thou had’st cause;
                  But I, that was his Son.—Home to thy Palace!
                  Home!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Let me stay beside thee; I’ll not speak,
                  Nor look, nor move. Let me but sit and drop
                  Tear for tear with thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Go.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  My Cousin Julian—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Madden me not. I’m excommunicate,
                  An exile, and an outlaw, but a man.
                  Grant me the human privilege to weep
                  Alone o’er my dead father. King, I saved
                  
                  Thy life. Repay me now a thousand-fold,—
                  Go.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Aye; for a sweet comforter.
               
               Enter Paolo.
               
                  Paolo.
                  My liege,
                  The lady Annabel—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  What? is she dead?
                  Have I killed her?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Speak, Paolo. In thy charge
                  I left her.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Is she dead?
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  No. Heaven forefend!
                  But she hath left the Palace.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  ’Tis the curse
                  Of blood that’s on my head; on all I love.
                  She’s lost.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Did she go forth alone?
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  My liege,
                  Prince Julian’s aged Huntsman, Renzi, came,
                  
                  Sent, as he said, by thee, to bear her where
                  Her Lord was sheltered.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Hoary traitor!
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  She
                  Followed him, nothing fearing; and I too
                  Had gone, but D’Alba’s servants closed the gates,
                  And then my heart misgave me.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Where’s my sword?
                  I’ll rescue her! I’ll save her!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Hast thou traced
                  Thy lady?
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  No, my liege. But much I fear—
                  Certain a closed and guarded litter took
                  The way to the western suburb.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  There, where lies
                  The palace of Count D’Alba! Stained—defiled—
                  He hath thee now, my lovely one! There’s still
                  A way—Let me but reach thee! One asylum—
                  One bridal bed—One resting place. All griefs
                  Are lost in this. Oh would I lay as thou, 
                  My Father! Leave him not in the high-way
                  For dogs to mangle. He was once a Prince.
                  Farewell!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Let me go with thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  No. This deed
                  Is mine.
               
               Exit Julian.
               
                  Alfon.
                  Paolo stay by the corse. I’ll after,
                  He shall not on this desperate quest alone.
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  Rather, my liege, seek D’Alba:— I deem
                  He still is at thy Palace. Watch him well.
                  Stay by him closely. So may the sweet lady
                  Be rescued, and Prince Julian saved.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  Thou’rt right.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Scene III
               An Apartment in an old Tower; a rich Gothic Window,
								closed, but so constructed as that the Light may be thrown in, near
								it a small arched Door, beyond which is seen an Inner Chamber, with
								an open Casement.—Annabel is borne in by D’Alba and Guards, through a strong Iron Door in the side Scene.
               
               D’Alba, Annabel, Guards.
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Leave her with me. Guard well the gate; and watch
                  That none approach the tower.
                  Exeunt Guards.
                  Fair Annabel!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Who is it calls? Where am I? Who art thou?
                  Why am I here? Now heaven preserve me, D’Alba!
                  Where’s Julian? Where’s Prince Julian? Where’s my husband?
                  Renzi, who lured me from the palace, swore
                  It was to meet my husband.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Many an oath
                  First sworn in falsehood turns to truth. He’s here.
                  Calm thee, sweet lady.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Where? I see him not.
                  Julian!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Another husband.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Then he’s dead!
                  He’s dead!
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He lives.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Heard I aright? Again!
                  There is a deafening murmur in mine ears,
                  Like the moaning sound that dwells in the
							sea shell,
                  So that I hear nought plainly. Say’t again.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He lives.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Now, thanks to Heaven! Take me to him.
                  Where am I?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  In an old and lonely tower
                  At the end of my poor orchard.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Take me home.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Thou hast no home.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  No home! His arms! his heart!
                  Take me to him.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Sweet Annabel, be still.
                  Conquer this woman’s vain impatiency,
                  And listen. Why she trembles as I were
                  
                  Some bravo. Oh that man’s free heart should bow
                  To a fair cowardice! Listen. Thou know’st
                  The sentence of the Melfi?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Aye, the unjust
                  And wicked doom that ranked the innocent
                  With the guilty. But I murmur not. I love
                  To suffer with him.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He is banished; outlawed,
                  Cut off from every human tie;—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Not all.
                  I am his wife.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Under the Church’s ban.
                  I tell thee, Annabel, that learned Priest,
                  The sage Anselmo, deems thou art released
                  From thy unhappy vows; and will to night—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Stop. I was wedded in the light of day
                  In the great church at Naples. Blessed day!
                  I am his wife; bound to him ever more
                  
                  In sickness, penury, disgrace. Count D’Alba,
                  Thou dost misprize the world, but thou must know
                  That woman’s heart is faithful, and clings closest
                  In misery.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  If the Church proclaim thee free—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Sir, I will not be free; and if I were
                  I’d give myself to Julian o’er again—
                  Only to Julian! Trifle thus no longer.
                  Lead me to him. Release me.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Now, by heaven,
                  I’ll bend this glorious constancy. I’ve known thee
                  Even from a little child, and I have seen
                  That stubborn spirit broken: not by fear,
                  That thou can’st quell; nor interest; nor ambition;
                  But love! love! love! I tell thee, Annabel,
                  One whom thou lov’st, stands in my danger. Wed me
                  This very night—I will procure a priest
                  And dispensations, there shall nothing lack
                  Of nuptial form—Wed me, or look  to hear
                  Of bloody justice.
                  
               
               
                  Annab.
                  My poor father, Melfi!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  The Regent? He is dead.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  God hath been merciful.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Is there no other name? no dearer?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Hadst thou such tender love for this proud father,
                  Who little recked of thee, or thy fair looks;—
                  Is all beside forgotten?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Speak!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Why, Julian!
                  Julian, I say!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He is beyond thy power.
                  Thanks, thanks, great God! He’s ruined, exiled, stripped
                  Of name, and land, and titles. He’s as dead.
                  Thou hast no power to harm him. He can fall
                  No deeper. Earth hath not a lowlier state
                  
                  Than princely Julian fills.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Doth not the grave
                  Lie deeper?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  What? But thou hast not the power!
                  Hast thou? Thou canst not. Oh be pitiful!
                  Speak, I conjure thee, speak!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Didst thou not hear
                  That he was exiled, outlawed, banished far
                  From the Sicilian Isles, on pain of death.
                  If, after noon to-day, he e’er were seen
                  In Sicily? The allotted bark awaits;
                  The hour is past; and he is here.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Now heaven
                  Have mercy on us! D’Alba, at thy feet,
                  Upon my bended knees—Oh pity! pity!
                  Pity and pardon! I’ll not rise. I cannot.
                  I cannot stand more than a creeping worm
                  Whilst Julian’s in thy danger. Pardon him!
                  
                  Thou wast not cruel once. I’ve seen thee turn
                  Thy step from off the path to spare an insect;
                  I’ve marked thee shudder, when my falcon struck
                  A panting bird;—though thou hast tried to sneer
                  At thy own sympathy. D’Alba, thy heart
                  Is kinder than thou knowest. Save him, D’Alba!
                  Save him!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Be mine.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Am I not his?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Be mine;
                  And he shall live to the whole age of man
                  Unharmed.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  I’m his.—Oh—Oh spare him!--Only his.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Then it is thou that dost enforce the law
                  On Julian; thou, his loving wife, that guid’st
                  The officer to seize him where he lies
                  Upon his father’s corse; thou that dost
							lead
                  Thy husband to the scaffold;—thou his wife,
                  
                  His loving wife! Thou yet may’st rescue him.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Now, God forgive thee, man! Thou torturest me
                  Worse than a thousand racks. But thou art not
                  So devilish, D’Alba. Thou hast talked of love;—
                  Would’st see me die here at thy feet? Have mercy!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Mercy! Aye, such as thou hast shewn to me
                  Through weeks and months and years. I was born strong
                  In scorn, the wise man’s passion. I had lived
                  Aloof from the juggling world, and with a string
                  Watched the poor puppets ape their several parts;
                  Fool, knave, or madman; till thy fatal charms,
                  Beautiful mischief, made me knave and fool
                  And madman; brought revenge and love and hate
                  Into my soul. I love and hate thee, lady,
                  And doubly hate myself for loving thee.
                  But, by this teeming earth, this starry Heaven,
                  And by thyself the fairest stubbornest thing
                  The fair stars shine upon, I swear to-night
                  
                  Thou shalt be mine. If willingly, I’ll save
                  Prince Julian;—but still mine. Speak. Shall he live?
                  Canst thou not speak? Wilt thou not save him?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  No.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Did she die with the word! Dost hear me, lady?
                  I asked thee wouldst thou save thy husband?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  No. 
                  Not so! Not so!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  ’Tis well.
               
               Exit D’Alba.
               
                  Annab.
                  Stay! Stay! He’s gone.
                  Count D’Alba! Save him! Save him! D’Alba’s gone,
                  And I have sentenced him.
                  After a pause.
                  He would have chosen so,
                  Would rather have died a thousand deaths than so
                  Have lived! Oh who will succour me, shut up
                  In this lone tower! none but those horrid guards,
                  And yonder hoary traitor, know where the poor,
                  
                  Poor Annabel is hidden; no man cares
                  How she may perish—only one—and he—
                  Preserve my wits! I’ll count my beads; ’twill calm me:
                  What if I hang my rosary from the casement?
                  There is a brightness in the gorgeous jewel
                  To catch men’s eyes, and haply, some may pass
                  That are not pitiless. This window’s closed;
                  But in yon chamber—Ah, ’tis open! There
                  I’ll hang the holy gem, a guiding star,
                  A visible prayer to man and God. Oh save me
                  From sin and shame! Save him! I’ll hang it there.
               
               Exit.
               End of the Fourth Act
               
            
         
         
            ACT V.
            
               SCENE.
               The same as the last; the arched Door nearly closed.
               Annabel.
               
                  Annabel.
                  I cannot rest. I wander to and fro
                  Within my dreary prison, as to seek
                  For comfort and find none. Each hour hath killed
                  A hope that seemed the last. The shadows point
                  Upward. The sun is sinking. Guard me, heaven,
                  Through this dread night!
                  A gun is heard without.
                  What evil sound—All sounds
                  Are evil here! Is there some murder doing?
                  Or wantonly in sport.
               
               Enter Julian through the arched Door.
               
                  Julian.
                  Annabel!
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My wife! Art thou still mine?
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Thine own.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  She smiles!
                  She clings to me! Her eyes are fixed on mine
                  With the old love, the old divinest look
                  Of innocence! It is yet time. She’s pure!
                  She’s undefiled!--Speak to me, Annabel.
                  Tremble not so.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  ’Tis joy. Oh I have been
                  So wretched! And to see thee when I thought
                  We ne’er should meet again! How didst thou find me?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The rosary! the blessed rosary
                  Shone in the sun-beam, like a beacon fire,
                  A guiding star! Thrice holy was its light
                  That led me here to save—
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Oh blessings on thee!
                  How? Where? what way? The iron door is barred!
                  Where didst thou enter Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Through the casement
                  Of yonder chamber.
                  
               
               
                  Anna.
                  What? that grim ascent!
                  That awful depth! Didst thou dare this for me?
                  And must I?—But I fear not. I’ll go with thee.
                  I’m safe of foot, and light. I’ll go.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Thou canst not.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Then go thyself, or he will find thee here,
                  He and his ruffian band. Let us part now.
                  Kiss me again. Fly, fly from Sicily!—
                  That fearful man—but he is all one lie—
                  Told me thy life was forfeited.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He told thee
                  A truth.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Oh fly! fly! fly;
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My Annabel
                  The bloodhounds that he laid upon the scent
                  Have tracked me hither. Didst thou hear a gun?
                  For once the ball passed harmless.
                  
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Art thou hurt?
                  Art sure thou art not?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Yes. But they who aimed
                  That death are on the watch. Their quarry’s lodged.
                  We can escape them—one way—only one!
               
               
                  Anna.
                  How? What way?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Ask not.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Whither?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  To—my father.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Then he’s alive—Oh happiness! They told me
                  That he was dead. Why do we loiter here?
                  Let’s join him now.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Not yet.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Now! now! Thou know’st not
                  
                  
                  How horribly these walls do picture to me
                  The several agonies whereof my soul
                  Hath drunk to day. I have been tempted, Julian,
                  By one—a fiend! tempted till I almost thought
                  God had forsaken me. But thou art here
                  To save me, and my pulse beats high again
                  With love and hope. I am light-hearted now,
                  And could laugh like a child—only these walls
                  Do crowd around me with a visible weight,
                  A palpable pressure; giving back the forms
                  Of wildest thoughts that wandered through my brain
                  Bright chattering Madness, and sedate Despair,
                  And fear the Great Unreal!—Take me hence!
                  Take me away with thee!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Not yet, not yet.
                  Thou sweetest wretch! I cannot—Dotard! Fool!
                  I must. Not yet! not yet!—Talk to me, Annabel;
                  This is the hour when thou wast wont to make
                  Earth Heaven with lovely words; the sun-set hour,
                  That woke thy spirit into joy. Once more
                  Talk to me, Annabel.
                  
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Aye, all day long,
                  When we are free. Thy voice is choked; thy looks
                  Are not on me; thy hand doth catch and twitch
                  And grasp mine painfully,—that gentle hand!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  O God! O God! that right hand!--kiss it not!
                  Take thy lips from it!
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Canst thou save me, Julian?
                  Thou always dost speak truth. Canst save thyself?
                  Shall we go hence together?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Aye, one fate—
                  One home.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Why that is bliss. We shall be poor—
                  Shall we not, Julian? I shall have a joy
                  I never looked for; I shall work for thee,
                  Shall tend thee, be thy Page, thy ’Squire, thy all,—
                  Shall I not, Julian.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Annabel, look forth
                  
                  Upon this glorious world! Look once again
                  On our fair Sicily, lit by that sun
                  Whose level beams do cast a golden shine
                  On sea, and shore, and city, on the pride
                  Of bowery groves; on Etna’s smouldering top;—
                  Oh bright and glorious world! and thou of all
                  Created things most glorious, tricked in light,
                  As the stars that live in Heaven!
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Why dost thou gaze
                  So sadly on me.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The bright stars, how oft
                  They fall, or seem to fall! The Sun—look! look!
                  He sinks, he sets in glory. Blessed orb,
                  Like thee—like thee—Dost thou remember once
                  We sate by the sea shore when all the Heaven
                  And all the ocean seemed one glow of fire
                  Red, purple, saffron, melted into one
                  Intense and ardent flame, the doubtful line
                  Where sea and sky should meet was lost in that
                  Continuous brightness; there we sate and talked
                  Of the mysterious union that blessed orb
                  Wrought between earth and heaven, of life and death—
                  High mysteries!--and thou didst wish thyself
                  A spirit sailing in that flood of light
                  Straight to the Eternal Gates, didt pray to pass
                  Away in such a glory. Annabel!
                  
                  Look out upon the burning sky, the sea
                  One lucid ruby—’tis the very hour!
                  Thou’lt be a Seraph at the Fount of Light
                  Before—
               
               
                  Anna.
                  What must I die? And wilt thou kill me?
                  Canst thou? Thou cam’st to save—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  To save thy honour!
                  I shall die with thee.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Oh, no! no! live! live!
                  If I must die—Oh it is sweet to live,
                  To breathe, to move, to feel the throbbing blood
                  Beat in the veins,—to look on such an earth
                  On such a Heaven,—to look on thee! Young life
                  Is very dear.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Would’st live for D’Alba?
               
               
                  Anna.
                  No!
                  I had forgot. I’ll die. Quick! Quick!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  One kiss!
                  
                  Angel, dost thou forgive me?
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My sword!—
                  I cannot draw it.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Now! I’m ready.
               
               Enter Bertone, and two Murderers.
               
                  Bert.
                  Seize him!
                  Yield thee, Prince Julian! Yield thee! Seize the lady.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Oh fatal, fond delay! Dare not come near us!
                  Stand off! I’ll guard thee, sweet. But when I fall
                  Let him not triumph.
               
               
                  Bertone.
                  Yield thee!
                  Strike him down.
               
               
               
               
                  Jul.
                  Thou canst die then, my fairest.
               
               The two murderers have now advanced close to Julian.
               
                  Bertone.
                  Now!
               
               One of the murderers strikes at Julian with his sword; Annabel rushes before him, receives the wound aimed at him, and falls at his feet.
               
                  Anna.
                  (before she is wounded).
                  For thee!
                  Then after.
                  For thee. ’Tis sweet!
                  dies.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Fiend, hast thou slain her? Die! die! die!
                  
                  Come on. fights and kills him.
                  
               
               
                  Bertone.
                  Call instant help! Hasten the Count!
                  Exit the other murderer.
                  Julian & Bertone fight, and Julian kills him.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My wife!
                  My murdered wife! Doth she not breathe? I thought—
                  My sight is dim—Oh no!she’s pale! she’s cold!
                  She’s still!--If she were living she would speak
                  To comfort me. She’s mute! she’s stiff! she’s—dead!
                  Why do I shiver at the word, that am
                  Death’s factor, peopler of unhallowed graves,
                  Slayer of all my race! not thee! not thee!
                  God, in his mercy, guided the keen sword
                  To thy white bosom.—I could not. Lie there.
                  I’ll shroud thee in my mantle.
                  covering her with it.
                  The rude earth
                  Will veil thy beauty next. One kiss!--She died
                  To save me!--One kiss, Annabel! I slew
                  
                  The slave that killed thee,—but the fiend—the
									cause—
                  Is he not coming?—I will chain in life
                  Till I’ve avenged thee; I could slay an army
                  Now, in my strong despair. But that were mercy.
                  He must wear daggers in his heart. He loved her;—
                  I’ll feed his hopes, and then—Aye—ha! ha! ha!
                  That will be a revenge to make the fiends
                  Laugh—ha! ha! ha! I’ll wrap me in this cloak
                  taking one belonging to the dead bravo.
                  And in the twilight—So!—He will not know
                  My voice—it frightens me!--I have not hidden
                  Thee quite, my Annabel! There is one tress
                  Floating in springy grace—as if—she’s dead!
                  She’s dead! I must not gaze, for then my heart
                  Will break before its time. He comes. The stairs
                  Groan at his pressure.
               
               Enter D’Alba.
               
                  D’Alba.
                  entering to an Attendant
                  Back, and watch the gate!--
                  All’s tranquil. Where’s the traitor?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Dead.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Who slew him?
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  And the lady,—where is she?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  At rest.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Fair Gentleness! After this perilous storm
                  She needs must lack repose.I’ll wait her here.
                  Friend! thou hast done good service to the state
                  And me; we’re not ungrateful. Julian’s sword
                  Fails him not often; and the slave who fled
                  Proclaimed him Victor.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He slew two.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  And thou
                  Slew’st him? Aye there he lies in the ermined cloak
                  Of royalty, his haughty shroud! Six ells
                  Of rude uncostly linen serves to wrap
                  Your common corse; but this man was born swathed
                  In regal purple; lived so; and so died.
                  So be he buried. Let not mine enemy
                  Call me ungenerous. Roll him in his ermine
                  And dig a hole without the city gate
                  For him and the proud Regent. Quick! I’d have
                  
                  The funeral speedy. Ah! the slaughtering sword
                  Lies by him, brown with clotted gore. Hence! hence!
                  And drag the carrion with thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Wilt thou not
                  Look on the corse?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  I cannot wait her waking.
                  I must go feast my eyes on her fair looks—
                  Divinest Annabel! My widowed bride!--
                  Where is she?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  uncovering the body
                  There. Now gaze thyself to Hell!
                  Gloat with hot love upon that beauteous dust!—
                  She’s safe! She’s dead!
               
               
                  D’Alba.

                  Julian.
                  But touch her not
                  She’s mine.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Oh perfectest and loveliest thing!
                  Eternal curses rest upon his head
                  
                  Who murdered thee!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Off! off! Pollute her not!
                  She’s white! She’s pure!--Curses! Now curse for curse
                  On the foul murderer! On him who turned
                  The sweet soul from her home, who slew her father,
                  Hunted her husband as a beast of prey,
                  Pursued, imprisoned, lusted, left no gate
                  Open save that to Heaven!—Off! gaze not on her!
                  Thy look is profanation!
                  
                  Enter Alfonso, Leanti, Valore, &c.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Entering.
                  Here, Leanti!
                  This way! Oh sight of horror! Julian! Julian!
               
               
                  Valore.
                  The Princess dead! Why D’Alba—
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Seize him guards.
                  Lead him before the States. This bloody scene
                  Calls for deep vengeance.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  If I were not weary
                  Of a world that sweats under a load of fools—
                  
                  Old creaking vanes that turn as the wind changes—
                  Lords, I’d defy ye! I’d live on for ever!
                  And I defy ye now. For she is gone—
                  The glorious vision!--and the Patriarch’s years
                  Were valueless. Do with me as ye will;—
                  Ye cannot call back her.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Off with him!
                  Exit D’Alba guarded.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Julian! Wilt thou not speak?
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I have been thanking heaven
                  That she is dead.
               
               
                  Valore.
                  His wits are gone.

                  My Julian
                  Look on me. Dost thou know me? I’m thy Cousin,
                  Thy comforter.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  She was my Comforter!
                  
                  And now—But I do know thee; thou’rt the King;
                  The pretty boy I loved—She loved thee too!
                  I’m glad thou’rt come to close my eyes. Draw nearer
                  That I may see thy face. Where art thou?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Here!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Poor child he weeps! Send for the honoured dead
                  Beside the city gate,—he pardoned me!
                  Bury us in one grave,—all in one grave!
                  I did not kill herStrew her with white flowers,
                  For she was innocent.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Cheer thee! Take hope!
               
               
                  Valore.
                  Raise up his head.

                  My Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He forgave me,—
                  Thou know’st he did.—White flowers! Nothing but white!
                  Dies.
                  
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  He’s gone!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  And I am left in the wide world
                  Alone. My Julian!
               
               THE END.
            
         
      
         SCENE—Rome, in the Fourteenth Century.
         
            ACT I.
            
               SCENE I.
               
                  Rome, in the fourteenth century. A Street in Rome.  A Temple in Ruins, in the background, a Portico with columns in front of it, so managed that a person may appear and disappear amongst the pillars and recesses.
               Enter Paolo, R., and three Citizens, L., meeting.
               
                  First Cit.
                  C.
                  Ah, Messer Paolo, a good morrow to thee! 
                  The streets are full to-day. I have not seen 
                  Such an out-pouring of our Roman hive 
                  Since the last jubilee. Whence comes the swarm? 
               
               
                  Pao.
                  L.
                  The stirring Ursini, on a hot canvass 
                  For their proud chief, the factious Martin.
               
               
                  First Cit.
                  He, 
                  Our senator! a proper ruler! sick, too, 
                  And like to die.
               
               
                  Second Cit.
                  R.
                  Nay, he were harmless, then. 
                  But ’tis his brother, John, of Ursini, 
                  The subtle John, that drives this business onward.
               
               
                  First Cit.
                  A proper ruler! Martin Ursini, 
                  That seized the Widow Landi’s house, to make 
                  A kennel for his hounds—that carried off 
                  The pretty child, Emilia Fano—none 
                  Hath e’er beheld her since.
               
               
                  Second Cit.
                  ’Twas likelier John! 
                  The dark, smooth, subtle John. He’s the prime mover 
                  Of these iniquities.
               
               
                  Third Cit.
                  Ye have bold tongues.
               
               
                  First Cit.
                  Art thou of their black faction?
               
               
                  Third Cit.
                  No; I ply 
                  My trade, and hold my peace.
               
               
                  Pao.
                  Stephen Colonna
                  
                  Should have been senator.
               
               
                  First Cit.
                  No—he’s too old:
                  The Count Savelli, or young Angelo.
               
               
                  Second Cit.
                  ’Tis ill to choose between them.
               
               
               
                  Third Cit.
                  Ay, and dangerous 
                  To meddle with such great ones. Dost not see 
                  A man in yonder porch?
               
               Looking toward the ruin, L.
               
                  Rienzi appears in the Temple, with a piece of decayed marble in his hands.
               
                  Pao.
                  Our honest neighbour, 
                  Cola Rienzi, poring o’er some stone 
                  With legend half defac’d. Thou knowest Cola?
               
               
                  First Cit.
                  A follower of the Colonna?
               
               
                  Pao.
                  Ay:
                  He haunts their palace, and, with rancorous hate, 
                  Pursues the Ursini. Didst never hear 
                  How his young brother, poor Antonio, fell,
                  Murdered by their base groom? He hates the Ursini; 
                  And follows the Colonna, scarce for love, 
                  Rather to feast his learned spleen—for Cola
                  
                  Is a ripe scholar—with sharp-biting gibes
                  And dark predictions: a rank malcontent—
                  A bitter railer.
               
               
                  Second Cit.
                  He approaches.
               
               
                  Rienzi comes forward, C., with the piece of marble.
               
                  Pao.
                  
                     Cola,
                  What dragg’st thou there? a stone?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  A mouldering stone! 
                  An earth-encrusted stone!
               
               
                  Pao.
                  A tombstone?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Ay—
                  Fit emblem of our city. Here be words,
                  An’ ye could read them,—words whose sense is dead 
                  Even as the tongue. Did ye ever hear the sound 
                  Of liberty—of country? Back to earth, 
                  Rebellious stone! Back! back! thou preachest treason
               
               Throwing the stone up the Stage, L.
               
                  First Cit.
                  Treason to the Ursini! What will thy patrons, 
                  The proud Colonna, say to this new power?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  My patrons!—Oh, they’ll fight! they’ll fight!—They’ll pour 
                  Their men at arms into our streets, and wage 
                  Fierce battle; burn and plunder, spoil and slay 
                  Guilty or innocent, or friend or foe:
                  Their nature, sirs, their noble nature.
               
               
                  Pao.
                  Well, 
                  And we? What is our fate, sir prophet?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  We! 
                  Whichever wheel turn round, we shall be crushed 
                  
                  Between the millstones. That’s our destiny,—
                  The destiny we earn.
               
               
                  Second Cit.
                  He’s right. The barons
                  
                  Make an arena of the city, vexing 
                  Our quiet streets with brawls; plundering and killing 
                  The peaceful citizens. Even the Colonna,—
                  Albeit Stephen be a thought more brave, 
                  And Angelo more kind,—even the Colonna
                  
                  Are tyrants to the people.
               
               
                  Third Cit.
                  Yet the yoke 
                  Must be endured.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Must! Be ye men?
               
               
                  Pao.
                  Why,Cola,
                  What should we do?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Talk, talk, my masters! Speech 
                  Is your fit weapon. Talk! Women and slaves 
                  So drown the rattle of their chains. Talk! talk
                  And tell in gentle whispers, gazing round, 
                  Lest other listeners than the storied walls 
                  Of these old temples hear ye, how on Monday 
                  A noble gallant, one of the Corsi, stole,— 
                  Seized is the courtlier phrase,—and wrung the neck 
                  Of Adriani’s falcon, a famed bird, 
                  Unmatched in Italy,—the poor old man 
                  Weeps as it were his child,—or how, on Tuesday, 
                  Black John, of
                     Ursini, spurred his hot courser
                  Right through a band of pious pilgrims, journeying 
                  To our lady of Loretto,—marry, two 
                  Are lamed for life!—Or how, on Wednesday—
               
               
                  Pao.
                  Stop—
               
               
                  Rie.
                  I can go through the week.
               
               
                  Pao.
                  But, for the pilgrims,—
                  Art sure of that foul sacrilege?

                  Parade the city.Distant shouts, R . Hark! do ye not hear
                  The shouting mob approach?—Sure as that ye 
                  Who frown, and lift your eyes, and shake your heads,
                  And look aghast at such foul sacrilege,
                  Will join your voice to that base cry, and shout,
                  Long live the Ursini! I know ye, masters.

                  Ye are Italians; men of womanish soul, 
                  
                  Faint, weak, emasculate: the generous wrath 
                  Of the manly Roman, with his lofty tongue,
                  Lies buried—not for ever.Nearer shouts, R. Hark! Here comes
                  
                  The tyrant of to-day. Go, swell his train.

               Exeunt Ursini, &c., L. --Paolo and the Three Citizens come forward, and are stopped by an armed Attendant --the Three Citizens, with their caps off, R. --Paolo, C., and the Attendant, L. 
               
                  Att.
                  Why, what a sort of sullen citizens

                  The very stones of Rome cast back the load

                     Rome, universal Rome, to view this deed,
                  The type of that to come. Yon creeping slave,

               SCENE II.
               —An Apartment in Rienzi’s House; a Roman chair, L., and one R., with a skein of red worsted; a Lattice down to the floor, C. F., opening into the Garden. 
               Enter Angelo and Claudia, through the Lattice.
               
                  Cla.
                  Beseech thee, now, away, Lord Angelo,—
                  Thou hast been here o’erlong.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Scarce whilst the sand 
                  Ran through the tell tale glass; scarce whilst the sun 
                  Lengthened the shadow of the cedar.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  See! 
                  The sun is setting—see.
               
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Scarce, whilst I said 
                  A thousand times—I love.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Look to the sun.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  I had rather gaze on thee.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  R. C.
                  And think how long 
                  We sate beneath the myrtle shade, how long 
                  Paced the cool trellis-walk. When next thou steal’st 
                  Hither, from thy proud palace, I must time thee 
                  By seconds, as the nice physician counts 
                  The boundings of the fevered pulse. Away, 
                  Dear Angelo; think, if my father find thee—
               
               
                  Ang.
                  L. C.
                  Oh, talk not of him, sweet! why was I born 
                  The heir of the Colonna? why art thou 
                  
                     Rienzi’s daughter? What a world of foes, 
                  Stern scorn, and fiery pride, and cold contempt, 
                  Are ranged betwixt us twain; yet love, and time— 
                  Be faithful, mine own Claudia—time, and love!
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Alas, alas!
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Thy father loves thee, sweetest,
                  With a proud dotage, almost worshipping 
                  The idol it hath framed. Thou fear’st not him?
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Alas! I have learned to fear him; he is changed, 
                  Grievously changed; still good and kind, and full 
                  Of fond relentings—crossed by sudden gusts 
                  Of wild and stormy passion. I have learned
                  A daughter’s trembling love. Then, he’s so silent— 
                  He once so eloquent. Of old, each show, 
                  Bridal, or joust, or pious pilgrimage,
                  
                  Lived in his vivid speech. Oh! ’twas my joy,
                  In that bright glow of rapid words, to see 
                  Clear pictures, as the slow procession coiled 
                  Its glittering length, or stately tournament 
                  
                  Grew statelier, in his voice. Now he sits mute—
                  His serious eyes bent on the ground—each sense 
                  Turned inward.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Somewhat chafes his ardent spirit.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  And should I grieve him, too? Lord Angelo, 
                  The love deserves no blessing, that deceives 
                  A father.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Mine own Claudia!
               
               
                  Cla.
                  We must part.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Oh, never talk of parting! ’Twas Rienzi
                  
                  That brought me hither first. Rememberest thou
                  A boy, scarce more than boy—thy lovely self 
                  
                  Scarce woman. Then was thy rare beauty stamped,
                  At once, within my heart,—then, and for ever. 
                  Thou canst not bid me leave thee, love, and time,
                  And constancy—oh, be as faithful, Claudia, 
                  As thou art fair!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Without, L.
                  
                     Camillo!
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Hence, begone!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Without, L.
                  
                     Camillo!
               
               
                  Cla.
                  ’Tis his voice—away, away! 
                  Hurrying Angelo across to R.
                  Here, through the lattice—by the garden-gate. 
                  Exit Angelo, R.
                  Now Heaven forgive me, if it be a sin 
                  To love thee, Angelo. Looking after him. My foolish heart
                  Beats an’ it were. He’s gone—he’s hidden now 
                  Behind the myrtle-hedge: thank Heaven, thank Heaven! 
                  He’s opening now the gate—I hear the key— 
                  But my sense is fear-quickened: now ’tis closed,
                  And all is safe. Sinks down into the chair, R. Oh, simple heart, be still,
                  Be still.
               
               Enter Rienzi and Camillo, L.
               
                  Rie.
                  Camillo, see that thou admit 
                  Only Alberti.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  None, save him?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  None. Claudia!
                  
                  Exit Camillo, L.
                  
                  
                     Claudia, I say! She trembles at the sound 
                  Of her own name, and flutters like a bird 
                  Fresh caught, as I approach. It likes me ill 
                  To scare thee thus, fair daughter. Time has been,
                  When thou hast listened for me—when my voice,
                  Half a street off—my footstep on the causeway—
                  Would bring my little 
                     handmaid, springing forth
                  With eager service, to fling wide the door, 
                  And seize my cloak. 
                        Claudia rises hastily to take his cloak. Nay, nay, I need thee not.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Oh, let me take it, father!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Sit thee down, 
                  And ply thy sewing.
                        Claudia sits R., and takes up the skein of ravelled worsted. Hath Alberti—no—
                  The west is glowing still. Hark ye, fair mistress:
                  Crossing the hall but now, I saw a shadow 
                  Upon the garden wall, as clearly traced,
                  
                  By the sun’s parting rays, as I see thee 
                  Weaving fresh tangles in that ravelled skein,
                  Which thou affect’st to wind. He must have passed 
                  By yonder open lattice. Art thou dumb? 
                  Didst thou not see him,Claudia? him whose shadow 
                  Darkened the sunny wall?
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Perchance, Camillo.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  
                     Camillo! old Camillo! when I told thee 
                  I saw him plainly as thyself:—the form 
                  Erect and stately; the proud head thrown back 
                  Crested with waving plumes. Perchance, Camillo! 
                  
                     Claudia, with thine old Roman name, I gave thee 
                  Precepts that might have made thee simply great,
                  As ever maiden of old Rome. Camillo! 
                  Wouldst thou deceive thy father? Pay’st thou thus 
                  His love, his trust, his doting pride?
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Rises.
                  Oh, no! 
                  Weeps.
                  No, no! I’ll tell thee all: forgive me, father,
                  Only forgive me!—Thou shalt hear—

                  Not now,
                  Not now, my Claudia; cheer thee, sweet! I’ll hear 
                  Thy tale some fitter season. Wipe thine eyes. 
                  Kisses her forehead.
                  If I’ve been harsh with thee, ’twas love, my Claudia,— 
                  Love of my fairest daughter, and vexed thoughts 
                  Of this oppressed city. Sit thee, sweet! 
                  They sit, C., Rienzi, L., Claudia, R.
                  All is at peace between us: weep no more,
                  My Claudia.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  This is joy.

                  I had been chafed 
                  By one of yon base minions. But the hour 
                  Of vengeance comes.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Of vengeance!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Say, of freedom:
                  Dost tremble at the sound?
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Oh, father, each 
                  Alike is terrible; for each brings war,
                  Fierce desperate war.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  
                     Claudia, in these bad days, 
                  When man must tread perforce the flinty path 
                  Of duty, hard and rugged, fail not thou 
                  Duly at night and morning to give thanks 
                  To the all-gracious power that smoothed the way 
                  For woman’s tenderer feet. She but looks on,
                  
                  And waits and prays for the good cause, whilst man 
                  Fights, struggles, triumphs, dies. Vex not thy mind 
                  With thoughts of state, my dear one; there’s no danger:
                  All whom thou lov’st are safe; all, silly trembler. 
                  Peace, peace! I will not hear thee: all are safe.

                     Alberti, welcome. 
                        Rienzi and Claudia rise. Be the scrolls affixed
                  On churches, at street-corners, in the markets? 
                  Art sure of the soldiers? Dost thou hold the watch? 
                  Thine answer in a word.

                  In one word, yes. 
                  All is prepared. I’m waited at the castle;
                  Yet hearken, Cola; I saw Count Savelli, 
                  
                     Colonna’s kinsman, conning yon bold summons:
                  Thou hadst best avoid him.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Nay, confront him, rather:
                  I’ll to their palace, meet them, baffle them.
                  Hast heard aught of the Ursini?

                  Yon wretch 
                  Was not even missed. Poor slave, he shall be cared for. 
                  Now, for the last time—Simple child, in, in! 
                  Lay all thy cares to rest. In, in, my child! 
                  Bless thee, my Claudia! my fair Claudia!Puts her gently off, R. Now

               SCENE I.
               A Hall in the Colonna Palace.
               Enter Colonna, Cafarello, and Lady Colonna, and Nobles, R.
               
                  Col.
                  L.
                  What,Martin Ursini our senator! 
                  An Ursini, and of that hated race 
                  The most abhorred, the worst. He chief of Rome! 
                  Sick, too. Tush! tush!
               
               
                  Caf.
                  The tale is rife,Colonna; 
                  
                  And, as I passed his palace, glancing lights 
                  And sudden shouts and merry music spake 
                  The high and liberal feasting which foreruns 
                  Expected triumph.
               
               
                  Col.
                  
                     Martin Ursini
                  
                  Head of the state! and the Colonna fallen 
                  Beneath their rival’s feet! His wanton vassals, 
                  The meanest horseboys of his train, will spurn 
                  My belted knights. Cousin, we must away 
                  To Palestrina, and array in force 
                  Our men at arms: they will be needed.
               
               
                  Lady C.
                  Crossing to C.
                  Fie! 
                  These brawls match ill with thy white hairs.
               
               
                  Col.
                  Good wife, 
                  Wouldst have me turn a craven in mine age, 
                  A by-word to mine enemies?
               
               
                  Lady C.
                  Art thou not 
                  Stephen Colonna, of that greatest name 
                  The greatest? Which of these, proud Ursini,
                  May match with thee in fame? But thy old wreaths 
                  Were won in nobler fields. These private feuds 
                  Are grown a crying evil.
                  Enter Savelli, L.
                  Count Savelli!
               
               
                  Sav.
                  A fair good evening, noble dame. Colonna
                  
                  Hear’st thou the news?

                  Of Martin Ursini?
               
               
                  Sav.
                  Nay, that were common, stale, and trivial. See,
                  I bring ye tidings of rebellion, sirs; 
                  High tidings! stirring tidings! prompt rebellion
                  Headed—I pr’ythee guess.
               
               
                  Caf.
                  R.
                  Rare food for mirth, 
                  If we may judge by look and tone. The wives 
                  Of Rome revolted; or the husbands risen 
                  Against their gentle dames.
               
               
                  Sav.
                  ’Tis a brief summons, 
                  Fiery, but scholarly, stern, bold, and plain,—
                  Calling the citizens to meet to-night 
                  And win their freedom. Such a scroll as this 
                  Is fixed in every street.
               
               
                  Caf.
                  How signed?

                  Guess! guess! 
                  There lies the mirth: ye’ll never guess—read here.
               
               Crossing to C. and showing a scroll.

                  What, Cola di Rienzi! honest Cola, 
                  Who saves Colonna here a jester’s charge, 
                  A fool without the bells. Honest Rienzi! 
                  ’Tis a device of the black Ursini.
               
               
                  Col.
                  L.
                  Likelier some freak of Cola’s. He hath turned 
                  A bitter knave of late, and lost his mirth,
                  And mutters riddling warnings and wild tales 
                  Of the great days of heathen Rome; and prates 
                  Of peace, and liberty, and equal law, 
                  And mild philosophy, to us the knights 
                  And warriors of this warlike age, who rule 
                  By the bright law of arms. The fool’s grown wise—
                  A grievous change.
               
               
                  Lady C.
                  L. C.
                  I ever thought him so: 
                  A sad wise man, of daring eye, and free, 
                  Yet mystic speech. When ye have laughed, I still 
                  Have shuddered for his darkling words, oft fell 
                  Like oracles, answering with dim response 
                  To my unspoken thoughts, so that my spirit, 
                  Albeit unused to womanish fear, hath quail’d 
                  To hear his voice’s deep vibration. Watch him! 
                  Be sure, he is ambitious.—Watch him, lords:—— 
                  He hath o’erleapt the barrier, poverty;
                  Hath conquered his mean parentage; hath clomb 
                  To decent station, to high lettered fame;—
                  The pontiff’s notary, the honoured friend 
                  Of Petrarch. Watch him well.

                  Cola Rienzi—honest Cola, rise 
                  ’Gainst us! Fair wife, I deemed thee wiser.—They 
                  Who plot are silent. Would we were as sure 
                  Of Martin Ursini! What says Avignon? 
                  The holy father hath not joined the faction?
               
               Enter Rienzi, behind, L., unseen.

                  All the race,

                  Veined in their stony hearts—the master-streak 
                  Of that cold marble. Of the cardinals, 
                  
                     Gaetano is a soldier-priest, but wary, 
                  And politic as valiant; Annibal, 
                  
                  A meek soft-spoken monk, who, crawling, climbs 
                  Ambition’s loftiest ladder. Of the nephews,

                  Art thou their friend? I have heard talk of wrongs 
                  Thou hast suffered from the Ursini.

                  Ay, ay—
                  A trifle of a life—a foolish brother 
                  Killed in a midnight brawl. Your privilege,
                  Your feudal privilege! ye slay our brethren, 
                  And we—we kiss the sword. This Martin Ursini—

                  Each other—the two cords that soonest knit 
                  A fast and stubborn tie: your true-love knot 
                  Is nothing to it. Faugh! the supple touch 
                  Of pliant interest, or the dust of time, 
                  Or the pin-point of temper, loose, or rot,
                  Or snap love’s silken band. Fear and old hate,
                  They are sure weavers—they work for the storm,
                  The whirlwind, and the rocking surge; their knot

                  Friends,
                  I come not here to talk. Ye know too well 
                  The story of our thraldom. We are slaves! 
                  The bright sun rises to his course, and lights 
                  A race of slaves!—He sets, and his last beam 
                  Falls on a slave: not such as, swept along 
                  By the full tide of power, the conqueror leads 
                  To crimson glory and undying fame; 
                  But base ignoble slaves,—slaves to a horde 
                  Of petty tyrants, feudal despots; lords 
                  Rich in some dozen paltry villages,—
                  Strong in some hundred spearmen,—only great 
                  In that strange spell—a name. Each hour, dark fraud, 
                  Or open rapine, or protected murder, 
                  Cry out against them. But this very day, 
                  An honest man, my neighbour,—Pointing to Paolo, R. corner.—there he stands,—
                  Was struck,—struck like a dog, by one who wore 
                  The badge of Ursini; because, forsooth, 
                  He tossed not high his ready cap in air, 
                  Nor lifted up his voice in servile shouts,
                  At sight of that great ruffian. Be we men,
                  And suffer such dishonour? Men, and wash not 
                  The stain away in blood? Such shames are common: 
                  I have known deeper wrongs. I that speak to ye, 
                  I had a brother once, a gracious boy,
                  Full of all gentleness, of calmest hope,—
                  Of sweet and quiet joy—“there was the look 
                  Of heaven upon his face, which limners give 
                  To the beloved disciple.” How I loved 
                  That gracious boy! Younger by fifteen years, 
                  Brother at once and son!” He left my side;
                  A summer bloom on his fair cheeks,—a smile 
                  Parting his innocent lips.” In one short hour 
                  The pretty harmless boy was slain! I saw 
                  The corse, the mangled corse, and when I cried 
                  For vengeance!—Rouse, ye Romans!—Rouse, ye slaves! 
                  
                  Have ye brave sons?—Look in the next fierce brawl 
                  To see them die. Have ye fair daughters?—Look 
                  To see them live, torn from your arms, distained, 
                  Dishonoured; and, if ye dare call for justice, 
                  Be answered by the lash. Yet, this is Rome,
                  That sate on her seven hills, and from her throne 
                  Of beauty ruled the world! Yet, we are Romans.
                  Why, in that elder day, to be a Roman
                  
                  Was greater than a king! And once again,— 
                  Hear me, ye walls, that echoed to the tread
                  Of either Brutus!once again, I swear,
                  The eternal city shall be free; her sons 
                  Shall walk with princes. Ere to-morrow’s dawn,

                  Meet ye, my countrymen?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  For freedom.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Surely, 
                  Thou art Cola di Rienzi?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Ay, the voice,—
                  The traitor voice.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  I knew thee by the words. 
                  Who, save thyself, in this bad age, when man 
                  Lies prostrate like yon temple, dared conjoin 
                  The sounds of Rome and freedom?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  I shall teach 
                  The world to blend those words, as in the days 
                  Before the Caesars. Thou shalt be the first 
                  
                  To hail the union. I have seen thee hang 
                  On tales of the world’s mistress, till thine eyes 
                  Flooded with strong emotion, have let fall 
                  Big tear-drops on thy cheeks, and thy young hand 
                  Hath clenched thy maiden sword. Unsheath it now,—
                  Now, at thy country’s call! What, dost thou pause? 
                  Is the flame quenched? Dost falter? Hence with thee, 
                  Pass on! pass whilst thou may!
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Hear me, Rienzi. 
                  Even now my spirit leaps up at the thought 
                  Of those brave storied days—a treasury 
                  Of matchless visions, bright and glorified, 
                  Paling the dim lights of this darkling world 
                  With the golden blaze of heaven; but past and gone,
                  As clouds of yesterday, as last night’s dream.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  A dream! Dost see yon phalanx, still and stern? 
                  An hundred leaders, each with such a band, 
                  So armed, so resolute, so fixed in will, 
                  Wait with suppressed impatience till they hear
                  The great bell of the Capitol, to spring 
                  At once on their proud foes. Join them.

                  Rie.
                  We are too strong for contest. Thou shalt see 
                  No other change within our peaceful streets 
                  Than that of slaves to freemen. Such a change 
                  As is the silent step from night to day, 
                  From darkness into light. We talk too long.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Yet reason with them;—warn them.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  And their answer—
                  Will be the goal, the gibbet, or the axe, 
                  The keen retort of power. Why, I have reasoned;
                  And, but that I am held, amongst your great ones, 
                  Half madman and half fool, these bones of mine 
                  Had whitened on yon wall. Warn them! They met 
                  At every step dark warnings. The pure air, 
                  Where’er they passed, was heavy with the weight 
                  Of sullen silence; friend met friend, nor smiled, 
                  Till the last footfall of the tyrant’s steed 
                  Had died upon the ear; and low and hoarse 
                  Hatred came murmuring like the deep voice 
                  Of the wind before the tempest. Sir, the boys,—
                  The unfledged boys, march at their mothers’ hist,
                  
                  Beside their grandsires; even the girls of Rome,—
                  The gentle and the delicate, array 
                  Their lovers in this cause. I have one yonder,
                  
                     Claudia Rienzi,—thou hast seen the maid— 
                  A silly trembler, a slight fragile toy, 
                  As ever nursed a dove, or reared a flower,—
                  Yet she, even she, is pledged—

                  To whom? to whom?

                  To Liberty. Was never virgin vowed 
                  In the fair temple over right our house 
                  To serve the goddess, Vesta, as my child 
                  Is dedicate to Freedom. A king’s son 
                  Might kneel in vain for Claudia. None shall wed her,
                  Save a true champion of the cause.

                  Those names have been so often steeped in blood, 
                  So shamed by folly, so profaned by sin, 
                  The sound seems ominous,—I’ll none of them. 
                  Call me the tribune of the people; there 
                  My honouring duty lies. 
                  The Citizens shout—Hail to our Tribune! The bell sounds thrice; shouts again; and a military band is heard playing a march without, R. U. E.

                  And listening heaven, proclaims the glorious tale 
                  Of Romere-born, and Freedom. See, the clouds 
                  Are swept away, and the moon’s boat of light 
                  Sails in the clear blue sky, and million stars

                  The gate of the Capitol opens, C. F., and Alberti and Soldiers join the People, and lay the keys at Rienzi’s feet.
                  Hark! that great voice 
                  Hath broke our bondage. Look, without a stroke 
                  The Capitol is won—the gates unfold—

                  Sweet lady, why so sad?

                  C.

                  Ber.
                  Try 
                  Yon emerald carkanet, or let me braid 
                  These pearls in thy long tresses.

                  She affects not 
                  Such glittering baubles; rather sing to her 
                  One of thy songs from the cold north.

               Song.—
               
                  Berta.
                  The red rose is queen of the garden bower,
                  That glows in the sun at noon; 
                  And the lady lily’s the fairest flower 
                  That swings her white bells in the breeze of June; 
                  But they who come ’mid frost and flood, 
                  Peeping from bank, or root of tree, 
                  The primrose and the violet-bud,—
                  They are the dearest flowers to me.
                  The nightingale’s is the sweetest song 
                  That ever the rose hath heard; 
                  And when the lark sings, the white clouds among,
                  The lily looks up to the heavenly bird:
                  But the robin, with his eye of jet, 
                  Who pipes from the bare boughs merrily,
                  To the primrose pale and the violet,—
                  His is the dearest song to me.
               
               
                  Ter.
                  Didst like the strain?
               
               
                  Cla.
                  There’s a deep wisdom in it:
                  The lowly blossom, and the wintery friend,—
                  They are the dearest. I’m set i’ the sun 
                  To wither.
               
               
                  Rosa.
                  She is sad again. Wouldst hear 
                  A merry story, lady? ”Or a tale of murder
                  To divert thee?”
               
               
                  Ber.
                  Or a legend 
                  Fresh from the Holy Land?
               
               Enter Rienzi, L.

                  Claudia rises hastily.

                  Leave us. 
                  The ladies rise to go out, R.
                  “Claudia—nay, start not!Thou art sad to-day;
                  I found thee sitting idly, ’midst thy maids—
                  A pretty, laughing, restless band, who plied 
                  Quick tongue and nimble finger.” Mute, and pale 
                  As marble, those unseeming eyes were fixed 
                  On vacant air; and that fair brow was bent 
                  As sternly as if the rude stranger, Thought—
                  Age-giving, mirth-destroying, pitiless Thought,
                  Had knocked at thy young giddy brain.

                     Claudia used 
                  
                  To bear a merry heart, with that clear voice,
                  Prattling; and that light busy foot, astir 
                  In her small housewifery, the blithest bee 
                  That ever wrought in hive.

                  Mine own dear home! 
                  Father, I love not this new state; these halls,
                  Where comfort dies in vastness; these trim maids,
                  Whose service wearies me. Oh! mine old home! 
                  My quiet, pleasant chamber, with the myrtle 
                  Woven round the casement; and the cedar by,
                  Shading the sun; my garden overgrown 
                  With flowers and herbs, thick-set as grass in fields; 
                  My pretty snow-white doves; my kindest nurse;
                  And old Camillo.—Oh! mine own dear home!

                  Why, simple child, thou hast thine old fond nurse, 
                  And good Camillo, and shalt have thy doves, 
                  Thy myrtles, flowers, and cedars; a whole province 
                  "Laid in a garden, an’ thou wilt. My Claudia,
                  Hast thou not learnt thy power? Ask orient gems,
                  Diamonds, and sapphires, in rich caskets, wrought 
                  By cunning goldsmiths; sigh for rarest birds, 
                  Of farthest Ind, like winged flowers, to flit 
                  Around thy stately bower; and, at a wish, 
                  The precious toys shall wait thee." Old Camillo! 
                  Thou shalt have nobler servants,—emperors, kings,

                  In Christendom but would right proudly kneel,

                  If the tall cedar, and the branchy myrtle, 
                  And the white doves, were tell-tales, I would ask them 
                  Whose was the shadow on the sunny wall? 
                  And if, at eventide, they heard not oft 
                  A tuneful mandoline, and then a voice, 
                  Clear in its manly depth, whose tide of song 
                  O’erwhelmed the quivering instrument; and then 
                  A world of whispers, mixed with low response, 
                  Sweet, short, and broken, as divided strains 
                  Of nightingales.

                  That throbbing heart of thine, keeps such a coil, 
                  I cannot hear thy words. He is returned 
                  To Rome; he left thee on mine errand, dear one;
                  And now—Is there no casement-myrtle wreathed, 
                  No cedar in our courts, to shade to-night
                  The lover’s song?

                  Mine own beloved child. Thou shalt be first 
                  In Rome, as thou art fairest; never princess
                  Brought to the proud Colonna such a dower 
                  As thou. Young Angelo hath chosen his mate 
                  From out an eagle’s nest.

                  Alas! alas! 
                  I tremble at the height. Whene’er I think 
                  Of the hot barons, of the fickle people, 
                  And the inconstancy of power, I tremble 
                  For thee, dear father.

                  And he the head of the great Roman name, 
                  That rivalled the Colonna! Ursini,
                  Thy brother shall not die. The grief is thine,

                  If ye resist, ye share his doom. Plead! plead! 
                  Dissemble with the tyrant,—stifle hate, 
                  And master scorn, as I have done. Plead for him.

                  To Cola—most familiar of the drones 
                  That thronged my hall of afternoons, content 
                  To sit below the salt, and bear all jests,—
                  The retinue and pest of greatness. Sue

                  Fear not, but revenge will come, 
                  We being friends, from whose dissension sprang 
                  The usurper’s strength. An hour will come.

                  Surely, no! ’tis stern, 
                  Goes up to Ursini.
                  Revengeful, cruel, pitiless! The people—
                  To soothe the fickle people—yet he’s wiser: 
                  He’ll be persuaded.
               
               
                  Fra.
                  He approaches.

                  Col.
                  What! 
                  Ushered with music as a king.

                  Why, this 
                  Is well, my lords, this full assemblage. Now 
                  The chief of Rome stands fitly girt with names 
                  Strong as their towers around him. Fall not off, 
                  And we shall be impregnable. 
                  Advancing up the Room.
                  Lord Nuncio, 
                  I should have askedthy blessing. I have sent 
                  Our missions to the pontiff. Count Savelli,—

                  I have a little maiden who must know 
                  Thy fairest daughter. Angelo,Colonna,

                  Wanting her princely Columns.

                  The holy pontiff kneeling at my knee, 
                  And emperors crouching at my feet, to sue 
                  For this great robber, still I should be blind 
                  As justice. But this very day a wife, 
                  One infant hanging at her breast, and two,
                  Scarce bigger, first-born twins of misery, 
                  Clinging to the poor rags that scarcely hid 
                  Her squalid form, grasped at my bridle-rein
                  To beg her husband’s life; condemned to die 
                  For some vile petty theft, some paltry scudi:
                  And, whilst the fiery war-horse chaf’d and reared, 
                  Shaking his crest, and plunging to get free, 
                  There, midst the dangerous coil, unmov’d, she stood,
                  Pleading in broken words, and piercing shrieks,
                  And hoarse low shivering sobs, the very cry 
                  Of nature! And, when I at last said no— 
                  For I said no to her—she flung herself 
                  And those poor innocent babes between the stones 
                  And my hot Arab’s hoofs. We sav’d them all,—
                  Thank heaven, we saved them all! but I said no
                  To that sad woman, midst her shrieks. Ye dare not 
                  Ask me for mercy now.

                  C.
                  Nay, good my father, sure to-day our name 
                  Hath cause of pride.
               
               
                  Col.
                  Heaven grant it prove so!
               
               
                  Sav.
                  Lady,
                  Thou art silent still.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Shall I speak for thee, love? 
                  Oh, weak and ineffectual were my words,
                  Matched with thy burning blush, thy quivering smile,
                  Thy conscious silence,Claudia!—Gentle friends,
                  Ye are nobly welcome.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  R.
                  This is well, fair son! 
                  Yet we lack mirth. Have ye no masque astir?
                  No dance, no music, no quaint mystery, 
                  To drive away the spectre, thought? A bridal 
                  Is but a gilt and painted funeral 
                  To the fond father who hath yielded up 
                  His one sweet child. Claudia, thy love, thy duty,
                  Thy very name, is gone. Thou art another’s;
                  Thou hast a master now; and I have thrown 
                  My precious pearl away. Yet men who give 
                  A living daughter to the fickle will 
                  Of a capricious bridegroom, laugh—the madmen!
                  Laugh at the jocund bridal feast, and weep 
                  When the fair corse is laid in blessed rest,
                  Deep, deep in mother earth. Oh, happier far,
                  So to have lost my child!
               
               
                  Cla.
                  L. C.
                  Father!
               
               
                  Ang.
                  R. C.
                  Thou hast gained 
                  A son, not lost a daughter.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  C.
                  Love her, Angelo; 
                  Be kind to her as I have been; defend her,
                  Cherish her, love her.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  More than life.
               
               Hands Claudia to the throne, L., and sits by her.
               
                  Rie.
                  Bring mirth—
                  Music, and dance, and song, and I will laugh, 
                  
                  And chase away these images of death 
                  That float afore mine eyes. A song—a song!
               
               Sits down in the Chair of State, R.

                  Hail to the gentle bride! the dove
                  High nested in the column’s crest!
                  Oh, welcome as the bird of love
                  Who bore the olive-sign of rest!

                  Oh, fairer than the citron bower! 
                  More fragrant than the blossom’d vine!

                  Hail to the bride!

                  Whose radiance o’er the column beams! 
                  Oh, soft as moonlight, seen afar,
                  A silver shine on trembling streams!

                  A pleasant strain! 
                  A Citizen rushes from amongst the Attendants, and presents a paper to Rienzi.
                  What wouldst thou, friend?
               
               
                  Cit.

                  Can the daemon
                  To whom his soul is pledged have ta’en this way 
                  To show our secret?—No, he smiles! he smiles!

                  Have ye no masque?

                  Sooth, my lord, 
                  We had plotted to surprise the gentle bride 
                  With a slight dance,—a toy, an antic.

                  Turban’d and rob’d, and with swart visages
                  A troop of lusty Moors.

                        Colonna rises. He startles at the word. He eyes
                  The cup as it were poisoned. Dost thou think 
                  We’ve drugged the draught? I’ll be thy taster.—Drink!

                  This is fatherly;
                  Noble Colonna, this is princely. Now,

                  Doth not that silence answer thee? Look on them.
                  Thou know’st them, Angelo:—the bold Savelli, 
                  The Frangipani, and the Ursini,— 
                  Ay, and the high Colonna; well thou knowest 
                  Each proud and lofty visage;—mark them, now:
                  They should be signed as Cain of old, for Guilt—
                  Detected, baffled, murderous Guilt, hath set 
                  His bloody hand upon them. Son, thou shudderest!
                  Their tawny masquers should have slain me; here,
                  Before my daughter’s eyes; here, at thy bridal; 
                  Here in my festive hour—the mutual cup 
                  Sparkling; the mutual pledge half spoke; the bread, 
                  Which we have broke together, unconsumed 
                  Upon the board; joyful, and full of wine; 
                  Sinful and unconfessed;—so had I fallen;
                  And so—the word was death.—From their own lips 
                  Came their own righteous sentence—Death!
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Oh, mercy! 
                  Mercy!—Thou liv’st.—’Twas but the intent—
               
               
                  Rie.
                  
                  My death 
                  Were nothing; but, through me, the traitors struck 
                  At peace, at liberty, at Rome—my country,
                  Bright and regenerate, the world’s mistress once, 
                  And doomed, like the old fabled bird, to rise 
                  
                  Strong from her ashes. Did ye think the people
                  
                  Could spare their Tribune? Did ye deem them weary 
                  Of equal justice; and mild law; and freedom 
                  As liberal as the air; and mighty fame, 
                  A more resplendant sun? Sirs, I am guarded 
                  By the invisible shield of love, which blunts 
                  The darts of treachery. I cannot die, 
                  
                  Whilst Rome commands me, live. For ye, foul traitors, 
                  I pardon ye, and I despise ye.—Go! 
                  Ye are free.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Ang.
                  To Rienzi.
                  Oh, thanks, my father.
               
               
                  Col.
                  Said he thanks? 
                  Chains, bring me chains! such words from such a tongue 
                  Were slavery worse than death.—Chains—Chains—
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Ye are free.
               
               
                  Col.
                  Is the proud pillar of Colonna fallen,
                  That base plebeian feet bestride its shaft? 
                  Is Ursini’s strong bear muzzled and chained,
                  That every cur—
               
               
                  Sav.
                  Good cousin, pr’ythee peace;
                  The Tribune means us fairly.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Still ye are free.—
                  Yet mark me, signors:—Tame your rebel bloods;
                  Be faithful subjects to the good estate; 
                  Demolish your strong towers, which overtop 
                  Our beautiful city with barbarian pride, 
                  Loosing fell rapine, discord, and revenge, 
                  From out their dens accurs’d. Be quiet subjects, 
                  And ye shall find the state a gentle mistress—
                  Else—
               
               
                  Col.
                  Doth he threaten?
               
               
                  Urs.
                  Hush! this is no time,—
                  An hour will come—
               
               
                  Rie.
                  What, do you mutter, traitors? 
                  Follow me instant to the Lateran. 
                  There, at the holy altar, with such rites,
                  As to profane were sin more damnable 
                  Than treason ever dared, to offer up 
                  Your vowed allegiance to free’dRome,—to me,
                  Her servant, minister, deliverer,—me,
                  Your master. Ye are free; but I will chain 
                  Your rebel souls with oaths. Follow me, sirs.
               
               Exeunt, R.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               The Capitoline Hill.
               Enter Ursini and Frangipani, R.
               
                  Fra.
                  C.
                  Nay, Ursini, why pluck me by the sleeve? 
                  Why steal from the procession?—Why reawaken 
                  The tyrant’s anger?
               
               
                  Urs.
                  R. C.
                  For revenge!—Ye are stunned, 
                  
                  Bewildered, as men rousing from a dream,
                  That know not where they stand. Dost thou not see 
                  Our great revenge is sure? The tyrant walks 
                  Blinded by his vain glory; confident 
                  In that straw fetter, an extorted oath; 
                  And we—Why are we not resolved? And be not 
                  Our bold retainers waiting armed in proof, 
                  Without the gates of Rome?—What, if to-night—
               
               
                  Fra.
                  
                  
               
               
                  Urs.
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Fra.
                  This very hour. Our tried and hardy band, 
                  Led by the chivalry of Rome, could carry 
                  The city at a charge; andRome herself 
                  Will rise against the madman.
               
               
                  Urs.
                  Here comes one, 
                  Whose name were worth a host. Didst thou not mark,
                  How, stung by the sharp scorn Rienzi flung 
                  On proud Colonna, the young bridegroom broke 
                  From his new father’s side?
                  Enter Angelo.
                  
                  Lord Angelo, 
                  A truant from this pageant?
               
               
                  Ang.
                  L.
                  As thou see’st.
               
               
                  Urs.
                  Yet, thy good father, our great Tribune—
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Sir, 
                  I am a son of the Colonna.
               
               Crosses to R.
               
                  Urs.
                  Ay,
                  The heir of that most princely house; and, sir, 
                  Fair though she be, a friend must frankly wish 
                  She owned another sire.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  C.
                  No more!—no more!
                  Enter Savelli and Cafarello, L. 
                  
                  How pass’d the ceremonial, Count? Beseech thee,
                  Tell us of these new rites.
               
               
                  Sav.
                  The noble train 
                  Rolled smoothly on. Rienzi led the band 
                  Right royally, sceptered and robed, and backing 
                  A milk-white Arab, from whose eyeballs flashed 
                  Quick gleams of glittering light. Colonna held 
                  The bridle-rein.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Stephen Colonna!
               
               
                  Sav.
                  Ay—
                  Thy father, sir. We meaner barons walked 
                  Behind, bareheaded, and with folded arms, 
                  As men doing penance to the holy shrine 
                  Of St. John Lateran. Then came a mummery 
                  
                  Of oaths to that indefinite she, the State— 
                  Republic, sir, is out of date—and then—
               
               
                  Caf.
                  L. C.
                  Ay, tell that impious outrage.
               
               
                  Sav.
                  Then Rienzi, 
                  Stepping before the altar, his bold hand 
                  Laid on the consecrated Host, sent forth, 
                  In a full pealing voice, that rolled along 
                  The fretted roof, like the loud organ-swell, 
                  A rash and insolent summons to the Pope 
                  And Cardinals; next he cited to appear 
                  The imperial rivals,Charles and Lewis; next, 
                  The Electors Palatine. Then, whilst the aisles 
                  Of the hushed church prolonged his words, he drew 
                  His dazzling sword, and, waving the bright blade 
                  To the four points of Heaven, cried with a deep 
                  Intensity of will, that drove his words 
                  Like arrows through the brain,—"This, too, is mine.”
                  Yes, to each part of this fair earth he cried,—
                  "Thou, too, art mine.”
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Madman! And ye—
               
               
                  Sav.
                  We listened 
                  In patience and in silence; whilst he stood 
                  His form dilating, and his haughty glance 
                  Instinct with fiery pride.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Now, by St. John, 
                  Had I been there, ye should have heard a voice 
                  Answer this frenzied summoner.
               
               
                  Urs.
                  Our answer 
                  Is yet unspoken. Angelo Colonna, 
                  If the old glories of thy princely race, 
                  Thy knightly honour, thy fresh-budding fame,
                  Outshine the red and white of Claudia’s cheek, 
                  Then—
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Wherefore pause? I know thee, Ursini,—
                  
                     Rienzi’s mortal foe, and scarce a friend 
                  To the Colonna;—yet, in honour’s name—
                  Say on!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Without, L.
                  Lead home the steed. I’ll walk from hence.
               
               
                  Urs.
                  Meet me at the Colonna Palace. Fail not.
               
               Enter Rienzi, attended by Colonna, and other Lords, L.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  L.
                  Ah! he is here.—Son! Ye may leave us, lords,—
                  We are content with your good service
                  
                  Son, 
                  Exeunt all but Rienzi and Angelo,
                  Methinks this high solemnity might well 
                  Have claimed thy presence. A great ruler’s heir 
                  Should be familiar in the people’s eyes; 
                  Live on their tongues; take root within their hearts;
                  Win woman’s smiles by honest courtesy, 
                  And force man’s tardier praise by bold desert: 
                  So, when the chief shall die, the general love
                  May hail his successor. But thou, where wast thou? 
                  If with thy bride—
               
               
                  Ang.
                  I have not seen her.—Tribune,— 
                  Thou wav’st away the word with such a scorn 
                  As I poured poison in thine ear.—Already 
                  Dost weary of the title?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Wherefore should I?
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Thou art ambitious.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Granted.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  And wouldst be 
                  A king.

                  Power dwelleth not in sound, and fame hath garlands

                  Of glory round the old imperial wreath,
                  The laurel of the Caesars; but I chose

                  Five thousand horsemen at the gates of Rome,

                  And trump, and war-cry, hurling their bright spears 
                  At the ursurper’s head! Why, now I know ye,
                  My gallant kinsmen.—When ye crouched, like hounds,
                  Beneath the tyrant’s lash; or stealthily,
                  At midnight meetings, and below your breath,
                  Mutter’d of murders—the quick poinard-stroke—
                  The calculated poison, that consumes 
                  So much of life a day—or that mute slayer,

                  Of armed knights and barbed steeds.—On, on! 
                  Whilst yet the column’d banners of our house

                  To read your mystery. The city’s full 
                  Of camp-like noises; tramp of steeds, and clash 
                  Of mail, and trumpet-blast, and ringing clang 
                  Of busy armourers; the grim ban-dog bays; 
                  The champing war-horse in his stall neighs loud; 
                  The vulture shrieks aloft. Ye are still leagued 
                  Against Rienzi.
               
               
                  Urs.

                  Why, I am spurned, derided, scorned, cast off,
                  As a child’s broken toy. Betray! I come 
                  To join ye. Ay, dear mother, to pull down 
                  The haughty tyrant from his throne, or fall 
                  As may beseem thy son. Angels and saints,
                  Bear witness to my oath!

                  Oh, put me 
                  To the proof, my lords! Why stay we here? Good father,
                  Think’st thou suspicion’s straining eye-balls sleep,
                  Or that the watcher, doubt, hath lost her keen 
                  And delicate sense of sound? We must forerun 
                  The tyrant’s fear. Follow me, ye that love 
                  The joy of glorious battle!

                  Her proud and joyful blessing, not her tears. 
                  Thou art the last of all my children,Angelo—
                  Dearest and last. Unkindness never came 
                  Betwixt us twain save once. But, had I sons 
                  As many and as brave as that old queen 
                  Who mourned her Troy in ashes, I would peril 
                  
                  Each several warrior in this cause as freely 
                  As thou, my one fair boy. Now speed thee forth,

                  Lady C.
                  His daughter.
               
               
                  Ang.
                  Poor, poor Claudia! I have left her 
                  Even on our bridal-day. But, if I fall—
                  Mother!
               
               
                  Lady C.
                  Fie! Fie! his daughter! speed thee forth 
                  To battle!—On, brave kinsmen!
               
               Exeunt, L.
            
            
               SCENE IV.
               An Apartment in the Capitol.
               Enter Rienzi, L., and Claudia, R., meeting, C.
               
                  Cla.
                  Father! 
                  At last I find thee, father!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Well, my child!
                  What wouldst thou?
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Nay, I know not. Be the guests 
                  Departed?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  All gone; and wherefore went ye
                  To the Lateran, dear father? And where loiters—
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Aspic!
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Methought a bridal should be merrier—
                  Not merrier, but happier. Angelo!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Oh, foulest ingrate! when I wed thy mother— 
                  Oh, fiend accurs’d!
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Nay, nay,—perchance he’s gone 
                  To crave his mother’s blessing. Is’t not strange 
                  That I should love so well who loves not me? 
                  But I have felt a yearning of the heart 
                  Toward that majestic lady, which hath reached 
                  Almost to painfulness. If I should kneel 
                  Before her and implore her grace—
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Thou’dst find 
                  Such welcome as the mountain cat might yield 
                  To the dappled fawn; such greeting as the wolf 
                  
                  To the curled lamb.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Oh! she would love me, father,
                  Even for the prideful love of Angelo,
                  That woke her hatred first. A mother joys 
                  To tell fond legends of her children: who,
                  Like me, would listen, with unwearied ear,
                  To tales of Angelo, and call for more
                  
                  And, when her store was ended, cry again;
                  And every day, and all day long, be fed 
                  With praise of that dear name? Why dost thou groan?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  A scorpion stung me.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Kill it, father—kill it, 
                  Before it sting again.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Alas, alas! 
                  I’ll think of him no more. 
                  Enter Camillo, followed by Alberti, L.
                  
                     Camillo, speak! 
                  Thy breathless speed and pallid cheeks have told 
                  A world of news already. Quick, Alberti! 
                  Thy tidings, man,—thy tidings!
               
               
                  Alb.
                  Good my lord, 
                  
                     Rome is begirt with foes. The barons lead 
                  Their vassals,—every palace voids a horde 
                  Of armed retainers.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  By Our Lady’s name, 
                  I have not heard so glad a sound, since that 
                  Which hailed me Tribune of the people! What!
                  These masking murderers turned to warrior knights?
                  Their mine of treason sprung! Now we shall work 
                  In daylight. Toll the bell—summon the guards!— 
                  Sweet, to thy chamber!
               
               To Claudia.
               
                  Cla.
                  
                     Angelo!
               
               
                  Alb.
                  He leads 
                  The rebel force.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  ’Tis false!
               
               
                  Alb.
                  I would it were.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Thou liest,—he is no rebel. Whom he leads,
                  Are friends to aid the Tribune. Be they not,
                  
                     Camillo? Speak, old man,—Be they not friends?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Alas! sweet lady.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Go not forth, dear father,—
                  They lie—be sure they lie,—yet go not forth! 
                  Stay here with me! Avoid him!—stay with me!
                  Leave me not here alone!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Peace, peace!
               
               
                  Cla.
                  I’ll meet him. 
                  Armed or unarmed, as friend or foe, I’ll fly 
                  To meet Lord Angelo. I am his wife—
                  His own true wife.
               
               Exit, R.

                  Entice her to her chamber, 
                  And watch that she escapes not. 
                  Exit Camillo, R.
                  
                  Now, good captain, 
                  Let the great bell, with loud and hasty tongue,
                  Summon the people, and the trumpet-sound
                  Collect the scattered guard. Be they all faithful?
               
               
                  Alb.
                  I’ll answer for them with my life.
               
               
                  Rie.
                  What, ho! 
                  My armour! See that Saladin be barbed 
                  
                  Complete in mail. By heaven, there is a joy 
                  In fronting these proud nobles,—they who deem 
                  Man valiant by descent.
               
               
                  Alb.
                  Shall we not send 
                  To guard the city gates?
               
               
                  Rie.
                  To fling them wide! 
                  Let the weak timid hare and wily fox 
                  Fence their dank earthy holes,—the lion’s den 
                  Is open. We will fight for Rome and freedom,
                  Here in Rome’s very streets, beside the hearths 
                  Of the freed citizens, the household gods
                  Worshipped in every faith. Fling wide the gates!
                  I’ll follow on the instant. Ho, my armour!

               SCENE I.
               An Apartment in the Capitol.
               
                  Rienziseated at a Table, R.— Camillo and Albertidiscovered in the front, R.
               
                  Alb.
                  My Lord Rienzi.
               
               
                  Rienzi motions them to be silent.
               
                  Cam.
                  See, he waves thee off: 
                  Trouble him not,Alberti—he is chafed, 
                  Moody, and fierce, as though this victory,
                  Which drove the noble mutineers before ye,
                  As stag-hounds chase a herd of deer, had ended 
                  In blank defeat.
               
               
                  Alb.
                  The Tribune bore him bravely
                  And we are victors.—Yet the storm is hush’d,
                  Not spent. When, after this wild night of war,
                  The sun arose, he showed a troubled scene 
                  Of death and disarray; a doubtful flight, 
                  A wavering triumph. Even at the gate 
                  
                  
                     Savelli re-collects his scattered band; 
                  The people falter; and the soldiery 
                  Mutter low curses as they fight, and yearn 
                  For their old leaders. Victors though we be, 
                  The Tribune totters. His hot pride—yet, sooth,
                  He bore him gallantly. Beneath his sword 
                  Fell the dark plotter,Ursini.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  How fared
                  The bold Colonna?
               
               
                  Alb.
                  The old valiant chief, 
                  With many a younger pillar of that high 
                  And honoured house, lies dead.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  And Angelo?
               
               
                  Alb.
                  A prisoner. As he knelt beside the corse 
                  Of his brave father, without word or blow, 
                  As easily as an o’er-wearied child, 
                  We seized him.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Lo! the Tribune!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Rising and advancing.
                  Now admit 
                  Your prisoners; we would see them. Thou,Camillo, 
                  Summon the headsman, and prepare the court 
                  For sudden execution.

                  Turning back.
                  If a true 
                  And faithful servant of the good estate,—
                  If thine old friend, great Tribune—
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Hark ye, sir! 
                  The difficult duty of supreme command 
                  Rests on my head. Obedience is thy light 
                  And easy task,—obedience swift and blind, 
                  “As yonder sword, death’s sharp-edged instrument,
                  My faithful servant, an’ thou wilt, my friend, 
                  Owes to this strong right hand.
                  Look that the headsman
                  Be ready presently.” The prisoners! 
                  
                  Exeunt Alberti and Camillo, L.
                  Ay, 
                  Even this poor simple remnant of the wars 
                  Can lead their fickle purpose. Abject changelings! 
                  Base huggers of their chains! Methought, to-day
                  These Roman Helots would have crouch’d i’ the dust 
                  At sound of their old master’s whips. I have been 
                  Too easy with the slaves. Terror, not love,
                  Strikes anchor in ignoble souls. These prisoners
                  Why could they not have died, as die thy shall.
                  
                  Was there no lance, no soldier’s glorious way 
                  To let out life, but they must wait the slow 
                  And shameful axe? Yet Angelo—

                  R.
                  Bring them to the light. The prisoners! 
                  The noble prisoners! I have seen ye, sirs, 
                  Before, at Claudia’s bridal,—you, and you, 
                  The Frangipani, and the Ursini,—
                  Ay, and the high Colonna: my allies, 
                  My friends, my subjects; ye who swore to me 
                  Allegiance at the altar; ye for whom 
                  One harlot sin is not enough,—who pile, 
                  Adulterate in crime, treason on murder,

                  I know no father, save the valiant dead
                  Who lives behind a rampart of his slain

                  Well!my foe. 
                  Thou hast seen me fling a pardon free as air, 
                  To foemen crouching at my feet; hast seen 
                  The treachery that paid me. I have lost 
                  My faith in man’s bold eye—"his earnest voice,
                  The keen grasp of his hand, the speech where truth
                  Seems gushing in each ardent word." I have known 
                  So many false, that, as a mariner 
                  Escaped from shipwreck, in the summer sea, 
                  Sparkling with gentle life, sees but the rocks 
                  On which his vessel struck, so I, in the bright 
                  And most majestic face of man, can read 
                  Nought but a smiling treason. Yet thou, Angelo, 
                  Thou art not all a lie! If I should trust—

                  To meet thee with an infant’s kiss; the eyes
                  Thou hast called so like my mother’s; eyes, that never 
                  Gazed on thee, but with looks of love.—Oh, pardon! 
                  
                  Nay, father, speak not yet: thy brows are knit

                  Make widows of their children?—send them down 
                  To the cold grave heart-broken? Tell me not 
                  Of fathers,—I have none! All else that breathes 
                  Hath known that natural love: the wolf is kind 
                  To her vile cubs; the little wren hath care 
                  For each small youngling of her brood; and thou— 
                  The word that widowed, orphaned me? Henceforth 
                  My home shall be his grave.— and yet thou canst not—

                  I should see nought

                  His weary footfall still!—I should have been 
                  In Angelo’s arms ere now.Bell sounds. Hark! hark! the bell!

                  It is the bell that thou so oft hast heard 
                  Summoning the band of liberty—"the bell 
                  That pealed its loud triumphant note, and raised
                  Its mighty voice with such a mastery
                  Of glorious power, as if the spirit of sound
                  That dwells in the viewless wind, and walks the waves
                  Of the chafed sea, and rules the thunder-cloud
                  That shrouded him in that small orb, to spread 
                  Tidings of freedom to the nations." Now 
                  It tells of present peril.

                  Swaying the inmost pulses of my heart 
                  As swings the deep vibration. ’Tis his knell.

                  That bell. The dismal noise beats on me, father, 
                  As from a thousand echoes; mixed with groans, 
                  And shrieks, and moanings in the air. Dost hear them? 
                  Dost hear, again? Be those screams real, father? 
                  Or of the gibbering concerts that salute 
                  The newly mad?

                  Wave o’er his neck with an edgy shine that cut 
                  My burning eye-balls; saw the butcher-stroke 
                  And the hot blood gush like a fountain high, 
                  From out the veins; and then I heard a voice 
                  Cry pardon! heard a shout that chorused pardon! 
                  Pardon! to that disjoined corse! Oh, deep

                  To Claudia! But the cold, cold grave—why come ye?
               
               
                  Second Cit.
                  For vengeance, perjured tyrant! for thy blood—for liberty!
                  
               
               
                  Rie.
                  For liberty! Go seek 
                  Earth’s loftiest heights, and ocean’s deepest caves;
                  
                  
                  
                  Go where the sea snake and the eagle dwell,
                  ’Midst mighty elements—where nature is,
                  And man is not, and ye may see afar, 
                  Impalpable as a rainbow on the clouds, 
                  The glorious vision! Liberty! I dream’d
                  Of such a goddess once; dream’d that yon slaves 
                  Were Romans, such as ruled the world, and I 
                  Their Tribune;—vain and idle dream! Take back 
                  The symbol and the power. What seek ye more?
               
               
                  First Cit.

                  Tyrant! thy life!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Come on. Why pause ye, cowards? 
                  I am unarmed. My breast is bare. Why pause ye?
               
               
               Enter Claudia, through the gate in the centre of the flat—Rushes forward to Rienzi.
               
                  Cla.
                  Father!
               
               
                  Sav.
                  Oh, save her!
               
               
                  Rie.
                  Drag her from my neck,
                  If ye be men! Save her! She never harmed 
                  A worm. My Claudia, bless thee! bless thee! Now—now!—
                  
               
               
                  Rienzi falls, pierced by many spears, and the people divide, leaving Claudia stretched on her father’s body.
               
                  Sav.
                  Ay, that thrust pierced to the heart; he dies
                  Even whilst I speak.
               
               
                  Cla.
                  Father!

                  Alas! poor child!
               
               
                  Sav.
                  She bleeds, I fear, to death. Go bear her in,
                  And treat the corse with reverence; for surely,
                  Though stained with much ambition, he was one 
                  Of the earth’s great spirits.
