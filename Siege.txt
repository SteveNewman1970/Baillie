ACT I. 

SCENE I. 

---A Grove near the Castle, with Part of the embattled Walls seen through the Trees: Enter Baron Baurchel and Walter Baurchel , speaking as they enter. 



Bar. 
Have done, Brother; I can bear it no longer. Hadst thou been bred in a cave of Kamschatka, instead of a mansion of civilized Europe, this savage plainness had been endurable: but--- 


Walt. 
I call a turnip a turnip, indeed, when other people say it is a peach or a nectarine; I call a pig a pig too, though they swear it is a fawn or an antelope; and they look at me, I confess, somewhat suspiciously, as if they expected to see a tail peeping from under my jerkin, or fur upon my hands like a bear.--- You would have me civilized, would you? It is too late in the day now, good sooth! 


Bar. 
Yes, the time is indeed gone by. This bachelor's life has brutified thee past all redemption. Why did you not marry Brother? 


[Page 176 ] 



Walt. 
Nay, you who have met with so many goddesses and creatures of perfection in the world, why did not you marry, Brother? I who could light upon nothing better than women--- mere women; every one of them too with some fault or failing belonging to her, as obvious as those white hairs that now look from under [25]  your peruke, was it any marvel that I did not marry? 


Bar. 
Had your wife possessed as many faults as you do wrinkles on your forehead, you would have been the better for her; she would have saved thee, as I said before, from brutification. 


Walt. 
And your's would have saved you from dupification, dotification, and as many 'fications besides, as an old sentimental, hypocritical, greedy Dulcinea, can fasten on a rhyme-writing beau, who is stepping most unwillingly, with his lace-cloaked hose, over that ungracious line of division, that marks out his grand climacteric. 


Bar. 
Hypocritical! greedy! you don't know the delicacy of her mind: nothing can be more tender, more refined, more disinterested than her attachment to me. You don't understand her. 


Walt. 
Perhaps, I don't understand the attachments of the fair sex now-a-days. An old rich neighbour of mine informed me the other night, that he is going to marry his poor friend Spendall's youngest daughter, who has actually fallen in love with him; and nothing, as he tells me, almost in your own words, can be more tender, 

[Page 177 ] 

[50]  more disinterested than her attachment. Not understanding these matters, Brother, I'll freely confess to you I did not give much credit to his story; but I may be wrong nevertheless. I dare say you believe it entirely. 


Bar. 
Ridiculous! What proofs can the fool possibly receive of her attachment? 


Walt. 
The very same which the Countess so condescendingly vouchsafes to yourself; she accepts of his presents. 


Bar. 
The very same! No, no, Walter Baurchel; very different! Does not every smile of her countenance, every look of her eyes, involuntarily express her partiality for me? 


Walt. 
Say, rather, every word of her tongue. 


Bar. 
With what generous enthusiasm did she not praise my sonnet to Sensibility. 


Walt. 
Aye, she is generous in what costs her little; for what are two or three lies, more or less, in the week's confession between her and Father Benedict? She'll scarcely eat a mouthful of partridge the less for it. 


Bar. 
O heartless infidel! Thou would'st mistrust the fond smiles of a mother caressing her rosy-faced infant. 


Walt. 
[75]  By my faith, so I would, Baron, if that same infant brought a diamond necklace or a gold snuff-box in his hand for every kiss she bestowed upon him. Every sonnet you write costs you, one with another, a hundred louis d'ors. If all the money vanity filches from rich poets could be transferred to the pockets of poor ones, verse-making 

[Page 178 ] 

would be as good a business as shoe-making, or any other handicraft in the country. 


Bar. 
Hold thy unhallowed tongue! These subjects are not for thy rude handling. What is all this grumbling intended for? Tell me what you want, and have done with it; you who pique yourself so much on your plain speaking. 


Walt. 
Well, then; I want you to let the next six sonnets you write go unpraised, and give the money that should have paid for the praising of them, six hundred louis d'ors, as I reckon, to Antonia. Is it not a shame that your own ward and heir, in love with the Lady of this castle, as you very well know, cannot urge his suit with advantage, for want of the equipage and appendages becoming his rank; while this conceited Count, by means of his disinterested mother, drains your purse so freely; and is [100]  thereby enabled to ruin the pretensions of him whom you ought to support? 


Bar. 
His pretensions are absurd, and cannot be supported. 


Walt. 
Why absurd? Is he not as brave, as well born, as handsome, too, as his rival? 


Bar. 
What signify all his good qualities? In the presence of his mistress he is an idiot. 


Walt. 
It is true, he loses all possession of himself in that situation, and therefore she despises him, while the gay confidence of the other delights her: but he should be supported and encouraged. 


Bar. 
How encouraged? Silly fellow! 


[Page 179 ] 



Walt. 
He feels too sensibly his disadvantages, and they depress him. He feels that he is not entitled to pretend to Livia, but as the probable heir of your estates; while your fantastical fondness for this woman and her son, makes it a doubtful matter whether you may not be tempted ---But hush! here she comes with her new-ruddled face, bearing her morning's potation of flattery with her, for a stomach of most wonderful digestion. 

(Enter Countess Valdemere , who, after slightly noticing Walter , runs up caressingly to the Baron .) 



Countess. 
How do you do, my dear Baron? [125]  I hope you have passed the night in sweet repose. ---Yet, why do I hope it? You scarcely deserve that I should. 


Bar. 
And why so, Belinda? 



Walt. (aside, making a lip at them) 
Belinda, too! Sweet innocents! 


Bar. 
Why should you not hope that I have passed the night in repose? 


Countess. 
Because I am vindictive, and would be revenged upon you for making me pass a very sleepless one. 



Walt. (aside) 
Will she make love to him before one's very face. 


Bar. 
Then I am a culprit indeed, but an innocent one. What kept you awake? 


Countess. 
O, those verses of yours! those dear 

[Page 180 ] 

provoking verses! they haunted me the whole night. 
( Baron bows.) 
But don't think I am going to talk to you of their beauties---those tender easy graces which they possess, in common with every thing that comes from your pen: I am going to tell you of their defects. You know well my friendship for you, my dear Baron, makes me sometimes severe. 



Bar. (aside to Walt. ) 
There now, you Churl, [150]  do you call this flattery? 
(Aloud) 
My dear Countess, your severity is kindness. 


Countess. 
Receive it then, as such; for indeed I must be very severe on the two last lines of the second stanza, which have disturbed me exceedingly. In the verses of an ordinary poet I should not find fault with them; but in a work, where every thing besides is easy, harmonious and correct, the slightest defect is conspicuous; and I must positively insist on your altering them, though you should hate me for being so fastidious. 



Bar. (aside to Walt. ) 
There now, ungracious Canker-tongue, do you call this hypocrisy? 
(Aloud) 
Madam, I kiss the rod in so fair and so friendly a hand. Nay, it is a sceptre, to which I bow with devotion. 



Countess. (to Walt. ) 
You see, good Sir, I take great liberties with the Baron, as, I doubt not, with the privilege of a brother, you yourself sometimes do. 


Walt. 
Yes, Madam, but my way of finding 

[Page 181 ] 

fault with him is somewhat different from yours. 


Countess. 
Yet you still find his generous spirit, [175]  I am sure, submissive to the rod. 


Walt. 
I can't say I do, Madam. 


Countess. 
You are unfortunate enough, perhaps, to use it unskilfully. 


Walt. 
I am fortunate at present, however, in receiving so good a lesson from you, Madam. 


Countess. 
O no! there is no skill with me. There are persons to whom one cannot say one-half of what one really thinks, without being deemed a flatterer. 


Walt. 
In this, however, I have been more fortunate than you, Madam; for I have said to him what I have really thought for these forty years past, and have entirely escaped that imputation. 


Bar. 
Aye, flattery is a sin thou wilt never do penance for. Thou can'st rub the side of a galled jade with any tender-hearted innocent in Christendom, and be mighty surprised withal that the poor devil should be so unreasonable as to winch at it. 


Countess. 
Nay, nay, Baron! say not this of so good a brother, the shrewdness and penetration of whose mind are tempered, I am sure, with many amiable qualities. 


Walt. 
Nay, pray, Madam, spare me, and deal [200]  with but one of us at a time. Such words will intoxicate a poor younger brother like myself, who is scarcely able to get a fowl for his pot, or 

[Page 182 ] 

new facings for his doublet, and cannot therefore be supposed to be accustomed to them. 


Countess. 
Sir, I understand not your insinuation. 


Bar. 
Regard him not, Madam: how should a mind, noble and delicate as your own, comprehend the unworthy thoughts of contemptible meanness?---Let me conduct you to company more deserving of you. Our fair Hostess, I suppose, is already in her grotto. 


Countess. 
No, she and my son are to follow me. But you must not go to the grotto with me now: no body is to see it till the evening. 



Bar. (offering to lead her out) 
A step or two only. 


Countess. 
O, not a step for the world! 

                                         [ Exit , Baron kissing her hand as she goes off. 



Bar. (turning fiercely upon Walt. ) 
Thy unmannerly meanness is intolerable. Still hinting at the presents she receives. Greedy as thou call'st her, she never asked a gift from me in her life, excepting my picture in miniature, which could only be valuable to her as she prized the original. 


Walt. 
[225]  Say rather, as her jeweller shall prize the goodly brilliants that surround it. 


Bar. 
What do you mean? 


Walt. 
What I should have told you before, if she had not interrupted us; that her trinket-broker is this very morning coming secretly, by appointment, to the castle, to treat with her 

[Page 183 ] 

for certain things of great value which she wishes to dispose of; and if your picture be not amongst them, I'll forfeit my head upon it. 


Bar. 
It is false. 


Walt. 
Here comes one who will confirm what I say. 

Enter Dartz . 



Walt. 
I'm glad to see you, Chevalier, for you can bear evidence to a story of mine that will not be believed else. 


Dart. 
This is a better reason for being so than most of my friends have to give. 


Walt. 
Is not Hovelberg, the jeweller, coming secretly to the castle to-day to confer with the Countess? 


Dart. 
Yes, he told me so himself; and added, with a significant smile, that she had some of her old ware to dispose of. 


Walt. 
Do you hear that, Brother? It was as [250]  much as to say, she had often had such truckings with him before. Aye; you are not the only man who has thought his own dear resemblance lapped warmly behind the stomacher of his mistress, while, stripped of its jewels, it has been tossed into the drawer of some picture-monger, to be changed into a General of the last century, or one of the Grand-dukes of Austria. As for you, Brother, they'll put a black velvet cap on your head, and make you a good sombre doctor of theology. 


[Page 184 ] 



Bar. 
You shall not, however, make me the credulous man you think of, Walter Baurchel, with all your contrivances. 


Walt. 
And you don't believe us then? 


Bar. 
Are you fool enough to imagine I do? 


Walt. 
That were foolish enough, I grant you; for though an old lover has generally a strong vein of credulity about him, the current of his belief always sets one way; carrying withered nosegays, tattered billet-doux, broken posies, and all kinds of trumpery along with it at fifteen knots by the hour. 


Bar. 
Walter Baurchel! Walter Baurchel! flesh and blood cannot endure the offensive [275]  virulence of thy tongue. 


Dart. 
He is indeed too severe with you, Baron; but what he tells you of Hovelberg is, nevertheless, very true. 


Bar. 
I'll believe neither of you: you are both hatching a story to deceive me. 

                                         [ Exit in anger. 



Walt. (shrugging his shoulders and casting up his eyes) 
What strong delusion we poor mortals may be blinded withal! That poor brother of mine believes, that the woman who refused to marry him when he was young and poor, yet smiles upon him, praises him, accepts presents from him when he is old and rich, must certainly entertain for him a most delicate, disinterested attachment; and you might as well overturn the walls of that castle with 

[Page 185 ] 

one stroke of your foot as beat this absurdity out of him. 


Dart. 
But you are too violent: it will not be beat out; it must be got out as it got in, with craft and discretion. 


Walt. 
Then devil take me for attempting it! for craft I have none, and discretion is a thing--- 


Dart. 
You will never have any thing to do with, I believe. 


Walt. 
[300]  What then is to be done? If it were not that I cannot brook to see the conceited overbearing son of this Jezebel, carrying off the mistress of Antonia, I would even let the old fool sit under the tickling of her thievish fingers, and make as great a noodle of himself as he pleases.---But it must not be.---Fie upon it, Dartz! thou hast a good head for invention, while I, heaven help me! have only a good tongue for railing; do thou contrive some plot or other to prevent the disgrace of thy friend. 


Dart. 
Plots are not easily contrived. 


Walt. 
I know this, else I should have tried it myself. 


Dart. 
Are you well acquainted with the Count? 


Walt. 
I am but just come to the castle, where I have thrust myself in, though an unwelcome guest, to look after the interest of De Bertrand; and should be glad to know something more of the man who has so much intoxicated the gay Livia. What kind of a being is he? 


[Page 186 ] 



Dart. 
It would puzzle me as much as the contriving of your plot to answer that question. There is nothing real in him. He is a mere [325]  package of pretences, poorly held together with sense and capacity enough, were it not for one defect in his nature, to make him all that he affects to be. He is a thing made up of seemings. 


Walt. 
Made up of seemings! 


Dart. 
Even so; for what in other men is reckoned the sincerest part of their character, his very self-conceit, is assumed. 


Walt. 
And what is the defect you hinted at? 


Dart. 
It has been whispered to me by an old school-fellow of his, that he is deplorably deficient in personal courage; which accounts for his mother's having placed him in the regiment of a superannuated General, and also, for the many complaints he makes of the inactivity of his commander. It is a whisper I am inclined to credit; and, if we must have a plot, it shall hinge upon this. 


Walt. 
My dear fellow! nothing can be better. Give it a turn or two in thy brains, and I'll warrant thou drawest it out again, shaped into an admirable plot. Direct all thyself, and I'll work under thee as a journey-man conspirator; for, as I said before, I have a ready tongue, but [350]  a head of no invention. 


Dart. 
We must speak of this another time. See who approaches. 


Walt. 
Ha! the man we are speaking of, and 

[Page 187 ] 

the deluded Livia. By my faith he has a specious appearance! and the young fool looks at him too, as she would not look at a worthier man, whose merit might be tarnished with a few grains of modesty. 

                                         (Enter Valdemere and Livia , followed by Jeanette carrying a basket filled with flowers, &c. 



Dart. (to Liv. ) 
Permit me, Madam, to pay you my profound homage. 


Liv. 
You are welcome here, Chevalier: what accident procures me this pleasure? 
Aside to Count ) 
He'll make one more at our midnight revel in the grotto. 



Vald. (Aside with some chagrin) 
Are there not enow of us? 


Dart. 
Being in this part of the country on military duty, I could not resist the pleasure of paying my respects at the castle: and I honestly confess I had a secondary motive for my visit, expecting to find amongst your guests, my old friend and school-fellow Antonia. 


Liv. 
Baron de Bertrand, you mean. He was here yesterday, but I really forget whether [375]  he went away or remained in the evening. 
(Affecting to yawn) 
Is he with us, or not Count? 



Walt. (aside to Dart. ) 
Meet me by-and-by in my chamber. My tongue is unruly, and I had better go while I can keep it between my teeth. 

                                         [Exit. 


[Page 188 ] 



Liv. 
Does not his amiable relation there, who steals from us so quietly, know where he is? 


Vald. 
If you are in quest of your friend, Chevalier, had you not better enquire at some of the peasants' houses in the neighbourhood? There may be some beauty in the village, perhaps, whose august presence a timid man may venture to approach, particularly if her charms should be somewhat concealed behind the friendly flax of her distaff. 


Dart. 
Pardon me, Count; I thought my friend had aspired to a beauty, whose charms would have pleased him, indeed, behind the flax of a distaff, but will not, I trust entirely intimidate him from the more brilliant situation in which fortune has placed them. Aye; that glance in your eye, and that colour in your cheek, charming Livia, tell me, I am right. 


Liv. 
[400]  They speak at random then; for it would puzzle a much wiser head than I wear on my shoulders to say what are his pretensions. He visits me, it is true, but suddenly takes his leave again, and the very next day, perhaps, as suddenly returns. 


Vald. 
Like poor puss with roasted chesnuts before her, who draws back her burnt paw every time she attempts them, but will not give up the attack. He may, however, after some more of those hasty visits, find courage for it at last. 


Dart. 
There is one attack, however, for 

[Page 189 ] 

which he never lacks courage; when the enemies of his country are before him. 


Vald. 
True; he is brave in the field, but he is fortunate also. He serves under an active Commander, while I waste my ardour in listless inactivity. 


Dart. 
Cheer up then, noble Count, I have good news to tell you upon this score. 


Vald. 
On this score! Is any change to take place? 
(In a feeble voice.) 



Dart. (after a pause) 
You are too well bred to be impatient for an answer. 


Vald. 
[425]  O no! You mistake me; I am very impatient; I am on fire to hear it. 


Dart. 
Expand then your doughty breast at thoughts of the glorious fields that are before you: your old General is set aside, and the most enterprising man in the service, Count--- himself is now your Commander. 
(After a momentary pause, and eyeing him keenly) 
Silent joy, they say, is most sincere; you are, I perceive, considerately and profoundly glad. 



Vald. (assuming suddenly great animation) 
O immeasurably so. Great news indeed!--- Strange---I mean very admirable news, if one could be sure it were true. 


Dart. 
True! Who doubts, what delights him? 


Vald. 
I thought the regiment was promised to another person; I was not prepared to hear it. 


Dart. 
So it appeared. 


[Page 190 ] 



Vald. 
But I am delighted---I can't express it:---I'm glad to a folly. Tol de rol---tol de rol--- 

                                         (Singing and skipping about affectedly.) 


Liv. 
Cruel creature! to sing at what, perhaps, will make others weep. 


Vald. 
Weep!---No I don't weep. I am [450]  happy to a folly, but I don't weep. 
(Skipping about again.) 
Tol lol de rol!---plague take these stones! this ground is abominably rough. 


Dart. 
Fie upon it! any ground is smooth enough for a happy man to skip upon. 


Liv. 
You smile, Dartz; your news is of your own invention. 


Dart. 
Not absolutely, Madam; there was such a rumour. 



Vald. (eagerly) 
A rumour! only a rumour! Why did you say it was true? 


Dart. 
To give you a moment's pleasure, Valdemere. If you have enjoyed it, you are a gainer; and the disappointment, I hope, will not break your heart. 


Vald. 
It is cruel indeed. But who can feel disappointment in this fair presence. 
(Bowing to Liv. ) 
Let us go to the grotto, charming Livia; we waste our time here with folly.---Give me thy basket, child, 
(to Jean. ) 
I'll dispose of every chaplet it contains to admiration. I'll hang them all up with mine own hand. 


Liv. 
Don't be so very active: you positively shan't follow me to the grotto: I told you so before. 


[Page 191 ] 



Vald. 
[475]  Positive is a word of no positive meaning when it enforces what we dislike. However, since you forbid it, I will not follow you; I'll go by your side, which is far better, and support your fair hand on my arm. 
(Putting Livia 's arm in his with conceited confidence.) 


Liv. 
What a sophistical explanation of my words! a heretical theologian is a joke to you. 



Vald. (Casting a triumphant look behind him to Dartz , as he leads her off) 
Good morning, Chevalier, you go in quest of your friend, I suppose. Pray tell him to take courage, and be less diffident of his own good parts, and he may at last be promoted, perhaps, to the good graces of his Quarter-Master's daughter. 


Dart. 
No body at least, who sees Count Valdemere in his present situation, will think of recommending modesty to him. 

                                         [ Exeunt Vald. and Liv. followed by Jean.) 


Dart. 
Impudent puppy! his triumph shall be short. Blind woman! are flattery and impudence so necessary in gaining your favour, that all other qualities, without them, are annihilated? He shall this very night pay dearly for his presumption. 

                                         [Exit.

ACT II. 

SCENE I. 

---A room in the Castle; enter Walter Baurchel and Dartz , by opposite Sides. 



Walt. 
Ha , my good Friend! punctual to a wish! You have got your head stored I hope with a good plot. 


Dart. 
I am at least more in the humour for it than I was. I have found his conceit and arrogance more intolerable than I imagined. I have touched him in the weak part too, and find him vulnerable. 


Walt. 
Well, but the plot. 


Dart. 
I have discovered also a trait of villainy in him, that would prick me on to the charge were I sluggish as a tortoise. 


Walt. 
So much the better. Now for the plot. 


Dart. 
As I passed just now through the little green copse near the postern, a beautiful girl crossed my way, and in tears. 


Walt. 
Tut! she has crossed thy wits too. 


Dart. 
Have patience; she'll be useful.---I questioned her gently. 


Walt. 
Aye; gently enough I doubt not. 


Dart. 
And find she is sister to that shrewd little fellow the Count's page: that her affections have been gained and betrayed by Valdemere; [25]  and she is now hovering about the castle, 

[Page 193 ] 

for an opportunity of upbraiding him, or in the vain hope, perhaps, of moving his pity. 


Walt. 
She has moved thy pity at least; what has all this to do with our plot? 


Dart. 
A great deal: I am telling you before hand what we shall have to work upon: a plot cannot, any more than a coat, be made without materials. 


Walt. 
Well, but shew me thy pattern first, and talk of the buttons and buckram afterwards. 


Dart. 
Be it so then, since you are so impatient. There is a friend of mine stationed about a league hence with his regiment; where he is to wait till he is joined by another detachment of the army, as the enemy, it is feared, may penetrate to these parts, and overrun the country. I mean to go to him immediately; make him privy to our design, and engage him to send a party of his soldiers to make a sham attack upon the castle at midnight, when we shall all be assembled at this fanciful banquet in the grotto. 



Walt. (nodding his head) 
Good. 


Dart. 
Valdemere then, as the gallant soldier [50]  he affects to be, and the favoured admirer too of the lady, must of course take upon himself the defence of her castle. 



Walt. (nodding again) 
Very good. 


Dart. 
This will quell his presumption, I trust; and expose him to Livia for the very paltry being that he is. 


[Page 194 ] 



Walt. 
Aye, so far good; you'll make some furtherance to the plot out of this. 


Dart. 
Some furtherance to the plot! Why this is the plot itself. 


Walt. 
The plot itself! Any simple man in the country might have devised as much as this comes to. 


Dart. 
It does not please you then because it is not intricate. But don't despise it entirely; though the outline is simple, tricks and contrivances to work up the mind of our victim to the state that is suited to our purpose, will enrich it as we proceed; and the Page I have mentioned, provoked by the wrongs of his sister, will be our subtle and diligent agent. Nay, should we draw Valdemere into great disgrace, we may bribe him, by concealing his dishonour, to marry the poor girl he has wronged. 


Walt. 
[75]  Ha! this indeed is something like a plot.---And Antonio's marriage with Livia, how is that to be fastened to the end of it? 


Dart. 
Nay, I have no certain hook, I confess, to hang that upon. It must depend on the Baron; for unless he declare Antonio his heir, he will never venture to propose himself as a match for the well-dowried Livia. But we shall manage matters ill, if we cannot draw the Baron into our scheme. 


Walt. 
Then a fig for your plot! It is as bare of invention as the palm of my hand. 


Dart. 
This is always the case with those who lack invention themselves: they are never 

[Page 195 ] 

pleased with that of any other person, if it be not bristled over with contrivances like a hedgehog. And I must be allowed to say, Mr. Walter Baurchel, that he who racks his brains for your service, works for a thankless master. 


Walt. 
He works for an honest one, then. 


Dart. 
Away with the honesty that cannot afford a few civil words to a friend, who is doing his best to oblige you! As much duplicity as this amounts to, would not much contaminate your virtue. 


Walt. 
[100]  Well, well, I am wrong, perhaps, but thou art as testy as myself. 


Dart. 
Because I won't bear your untoward humour. Some people find every body testy who approaches them, and marvel at their own bad luck.---But no more of this: let us think of our friend. Does the Baron believe what you told him of Hovelberg's appointment with the Countess? 


Walt. 
He makes a shew of not believing it, but I think he has his own suspicions at bottom; for his valet tells me, he has sent to desire Hovelberg to speak with him as soon as he arrives. 


Dart. 
Here comes De Bertrand; I hear his steps. 


Walt. 
Is he returned to the castle? 


Dart. 
Yes; I forgot to tell you so, you were in such a hurry for your plot. 


Walt. 
Silly fellow! he cannot stay away from his capricious mistress, though the first glance of her eye sinks him to a poltron at once. 


[Page 196 ] 

Enter Antonio . 




Ant. (to Walt. ) 
Good morning, gentle Kinsman; ---but methinks you are not very glad to see me; these are not looks of welcome. 


Walt. 
Thou art one of those that trouble me. 


Ant. 
[125]  I am of a pretty numerous class of beings then, from the kitten that gnaws at your shoestring, to the Baron, who spoils your best pen in writing love-verses to his mistress. 


Walt. 
Well; and they would torment any man. Love-verses! with such an old painted hypocrite for the object of them! 


Ant. 
His first love, you know; his Delia. 


Walt. 
His Delia! His delusion. Is there such a thing as witchcraft in the world? I believe in good earnest there is. Her dominion over him is a mystery; a more than Egyptian blindness. 


Ant. 
Nay, you have yourself in a good degree to blame for it, my good Sir. Had you encouraged his humour, harmless as it is; bestowing some praise on his verses, and less abuse on the too youthful cut of his peruke, she could never have taken possession of him as she has done. 


Walt. 
Praise his verses, and not abuse his peruke! it had been beyond the self-denial of a faint. 


Dart. 
And had you--- 



Walt. (to Dart. ) 
One assailant at a time, if [150]  you please. 


[Page 197 ] 



Dart. 
Excuse me, Sir; I must needs say, had you even paid a little attention to the Countess herself, when she first renewed her intimacy with the Baron, she would have been less anxious, perhaps, to estrange him from his old friends. 


Walt. 
Attention to her! I could not have done it to gain myself, like Mahomet, the entrance to the seventh heaven. I must tell people plainly what I think of them, though I should hang for it. 


Dart. 
Had you said starve for it, you had named the fate that more commonly attends plain speaking. 


Ant. 
And in telling people disagreeable truths to gratify your own humour too, are you surprised, my good Sir, that they should not be edified thereby? 



Walt. (to Ant. ) 
What, young Soldier, you are become a plain speaker too. 


Ant. 
Just to shew you, Sir, how agreeable it is. 


Walt. 
Ha, ha, ha! Well; thou hast the better of me now. Would thou could'st prate as briskly [175]  to thy mistress! that would do more for thee in one hour than all thy bashful tenderness in a year. 


Ant. 
I might---I should indeed---I defend not my weakness.---You promised on this point to spare me. 


Walt. 
Aye, the very sound of her name quells 

[Page 198 ] 

thy spirit, and makes thee hesitate and stammer like a culprit. It is provoking. 


Dart. 
You profess a violent detestation of conceit, my shrewd Sir; where, then, is your indulgence for modesty? 


Walt. 
You mistake the matter, Dartz. Your friend there, has a good a conceit of himself as any man: he is not modest but bashful; a weakness too that only besets him in the presence of his mistress. By this good fist of mine! it provokes me almost to the cudgelling of such an unaccountable ninny. But I would cudgel thee, and serve thee too, De Bertrand. Take courage; we have a plot in our heads to make a man of thee at last. 



Dart. (aside, pulling Walt. by the sleeve) 
Say not a word of the plot: his sense of honour is so delicate, he would recoil at it. 


Ant. 
[200]  A plot did you say? 


Walt. 
Aye, a kind of a plot;---that is to say ---What kind of a plot is it Dartz? 


Dart. 
Have you forgot your own scheme for cheating the virtuoso, when your cabinet of antiquities comes to the hammer? 


Walt. 
By my fay! this memory of mine is not worth a pinch of tobacco. 
(Seeing Ant. look at his watch) 
Art thou going any where? 


Ant. 
No;---I did think---I believe I shall take a turn on the terrace. 



Dart. (to Ant. ) 
I understand you: take a turn in the cabinet of paintings rather; that will suit your purpose better. 


[Page 199 ] 



Ant. 
May I presume to go there? 


Walt. 
Presume, Simpleton! That impudent puppy of a Count lords it in her dressing-room. Go thy ways! 
(pushing him off the stage with slight anger: Exit Antonio .) 
That fellow provokes me; yet there is something in him that goes so near my heart: he is more akin to me than his blood entitles him to be: he is like a part of myself. 


Dart. 
Not the least like it. Now that you have taught us to speak plainly, I must needs [225]  say, were he at all like yourself, you would disinherit him in the course of a month. 


Walt. 
You are right, perhaps.---But alas! he would not be much the poorer for being disinherited by me. O that old fool of a brother! I could flog him for his poetry! 


Dart. 
Have patience, and we may find a better way of dealing with him. If we could persuade him to disguise himself like a diamond merchant, and accompany Hovelberg when he visits the Countess, he would be convinced of the true nature of her regard for him. 


Walt. 
An excellent thought! This is just what was wanting to make our plot really like a plot. 


Dart. 
I'm glad it pleases you at last.---Before I leave the castle to negociate with my friend for his myrmidons, I'll find out the Baron, and endeavour to persuade him. 


Walt. 
Heaven prosper thee! but return, ere thou goest, and let me know the result. 


[Page 200 ] 



Dart. 
Depend upon it. 

                                         [ Exeunt severally. 

SCENE II. 

A Room hung with Paintings, and otherwise enriched with Carving and Ornaments, &c. Enter Valdemere and Antonio . 



Vald. 
Here are some good paintings, De Bertrand; if you have any taste for the art, they will please you. This Guido on the left is a divine thing. The Magdalen in Count Orrinberg's collection was considered as superior to it; but I always maintained this to be the best painting of the two, and the world have at last adopted my opinion. I have always decidedly thought---But you are not looking at it. Is there any thing in that door to arrest your attention? The carving on it is but indifferent. 


Ant. 
I thought I heard footsteps. She's coming. 


Vald. 
Pooh! she won't be here this half hour; so you need not yet take alarm, as if an enemy were advancing upon you. 


Ant. 
You connect the idea of alarm with an enemy; would I had firmness to face what I love! You are a happy man, Valdemere, and a bold one too, most assuredly: what would not I give for a little of your happy self-possession. 


Vald. 
Aye; it is an article of some value: he who can't possess himself, must not expect to possess his mistress. 


[Page 201 ] 



Ant. 
[25]  A very specious maxim this, from a young fellow's mouth with the manliness of well-curled whiskers to support it: yet I have seen the embarrassment of a diffident character plead its own cause more effectually than the eloquence of a brazen-browed Barrister. At least I have always felt it have more power over me. 


Vald. 
That is natural enough: it is a common selfish sympathy: one thief pities another when the rope is round his neck. Feeling for others is the consequence of our own imperfections; this is a known truth. 


Ant. 
Establish it if you can, Valdemere, for it will go well nigh to prove you immaculate. 


Vald. 
How far soever I may be from that degree of perfection, jealousy at least is not one of my faults, since I have introduced a rival into the apartments of my mistress, where he had not the courage to venture alone, and am also pointing out to him what he has not discovered for himself, that her picture is now before his eyes. 

                                         (Pointing to a picture.) 



Ant. (looking up to it eagerly) 
It is somewhat like. 


Vald. 
She sat for it at my request: no one [50]  else could prevail on her. The painter knew my taste in these matters, and has taken wonderful pains with it. 



Ant. (sighing) 
You have indeed been honoured. 


[Page 202 ] 



Vald. 
He has made the eyes to look upon you with such expression. 


Ant. 
Think you so? To me he appears to have failed in this respect; or perhaps it is because any semblance of eyes which I can thus stedfastly look upon, are not to me the eyes of Livia. 


Vald. 
I did not suspect you to be so fastidious. 


Ant. 
Not so neither. But surely eyes of such vivid expression should never be painted as looking at the spectator; for what pencil in the world can produce the effect he demands? They should be directed to some other object; and then he sees them as he has been accustomed to see them. 

Enter Livia behind them. 



Vald. 
Perhaps you are right: you talk like a connoisseur on the subject. 


Liv. 
I come in good time then; for connoisseur or not, to hear De Bertrand talk at all is a very lucky adventure. You have wronged us much, Baron, to keep us so long ignorant of [75]  your taste for the fine arts. 



Ant. (embarrassed) 
Madam, I am much honoured. I am very little--- 
(mumbling words in a confused way that are not heard.) 
I am very much obliged to you. 


Liv. 
You are grateful for slight obligations. But you are looking at my picture, I see, which was painted two years ago at the request of a 

[Page 203 ] 

good old uncle of mine; pray give me your opinion of it. 


Ant. 
It appears---it is very charming. It is---that is, I suppose, it is very finely painted. 


Liv. 
It is reckon'd so: and it certainly does more than justice to the original. 
( Ant. hesitates as if he would speak but remains silent.) 
You are of my opinion, I perceive, or at least too well bred to contradict me. Confess it freely: you are of my opinion. 


Ant. 
O entirely, Madam. 


Liv. 
You flatter me exceedingly. 


Ant. 
I meant it in simple sincerity. 


Liv. 
O, sincere enough I doubt not. 


Vald. 
And surely you will not question its simplicity. 



Liv. (to Vald. , turning from Ant. with pity and contempt) 
Don't let us be too hard upon him. [100]  Pray look at that picture of my great Aunt who was a celebrated beauty. 



Vald. (gazing with affected admiration at Livia 's picture) 
I have no eyes for any other beauty than what I now gaze upon. 


Liv. 
And do you indeed admire this picture so much? 


Vald. 
The faintest resemblance of its fair original is fascinating. Yet methinks the painter has failed in the expression of the eyes. But any eyes indeed that I can look thus stedfastly upon, are not to me the eyes of Livia. 


Liv. 
Ah! these are in truth the words of a too partial friend. 


Vald. 
Words from the heart, divine Livia, 

[Page 204 ] 

will tell from whence they came. 
(They both walk to the bottom of the stage, speaking in dumb-shew, while Ant. remains in the front.) 



Ant. (aside) 
With my own words he woos her, and before my face too.---Matchless impudence! ---And such a man as this pleases Livia! ---He whispers in her ear, and she smiles.---My heart sickens at it.---I'll look no more, lest I become envious and revengeful, and hateful to myself.---O Nature! hast thou made me of such poor stuff as this? 



Vald. (turning round from the bottom of the stage) 
Ha, De Bertrand! are you declaiming? Some speech of a tragedy, I suppose, from the [125]  vehemence of your gesture. Pray let Livia hear you: she is partial, you know, to every thing you do, and finds every exhibition you make before her particularly amusing. 



Ant. (sternly) 
Come nearer to me, Sir; the first part of my speech is for your private ear.--- Come nearer. 


Liv. 
Pray go to him: by the tone of his voice he personates some tyrant, and must be obeyed. 


Ant. 
Yes, Sir, I must be obeyed. 
Vald. shuffles up to him unwillingly, and Ant. speaks in his ear.) 
Take no more impertinent liberties with me in this lady's presence, or be prepared to justify them elsewhere. 

                                         ( Exit , looking at Vald. sternly, who remains silent.) 



Liv. (advancing to the front) 
What is the matter, Count? 


Vald. 
Nothing---nothing at all. 


[Page 205 ] 



Liv. 
Nay something unpleasant has passed between you. 


Vald. 
I believe I did wrong: I should have treated him more gently. But the strangeness of his behaviour obliged me to use threatening words, upon which he withdrew, and chose not to understand them. 


Liv. 
How ill one judges then by dumb-shew of what passes at a distance. 


Vald. 
[150]  I am always calm on these oocasions, while he assumes the fierceness of a boaster. 


Liv. 
But you will not call him out for such a trifle. 


Vald. 
Not for the world, divine Creature, if it give you uneasiness. 


Liv. 
How gentle you are! The brave are always so. 


Vald. 
How can I be otherwise with such an angel to prompt me? No; the braggard may live in safety for me; I will not harm one hair of his head. 


Liv. 
I thank you, dear Valdemere! and now to recompense your goodness, I'll shew the beautiful gem I promised you: follow me. 


Vald. 
Yes, bewitching Maid! to the world's end, to the bottom of the ocean, to the cannon's brazen mouth, I would follow thee. 

                                         [ Exeunt . 


[Page 206 ] 


SCENE III. 

The Countess's dressing Room: She enters from an inner Chamber with a small shagreen Case in her Hand, followed by Jeanetta , carrying a Casket which she sets upon a Table. 



Countess. 
Jeanetta! let me take a last look of those dear things before I part with them for ever. 


Jean. 
I'm sure, my Lady, they are so handsome, and you look so handsome when you wear them, it would go to my heart to part with them. 


Countess. 
But my dear boy must have money, Jeanetta, and I have been expensive myself. 
(Opens the casket, and looks at the jewels.) 
My diamonds, my pearls, my rubies, my darlings! for the sake of a still greater darling I must part with you all. 


Jean. 
But if I might presume to speak, my Lady; don't you indulge the young Count too much in extravagance? 


Countess. 
O no, Jeanetta; I doat upon him: it is this amiable weakness of character which all the world remarks and admires in me. And he loves me entirely too; he would sacrifice his life for my sake. 


Jean. 
He'll sacrifice nothing else, however; for he never gives up the smallest convenience of his own to oblige you. 


Countess. 
Small things are of no consequence: [25]  he would give up for me, I am confident, the 

[Page 207 ] 

thing most dear to his heart: and for him--- to see him lord of this castle and its domains, and occupying in society the brilliant place that becomes him, I would---what would I not sacrifice! 


Jean. 
Were he to live on the fortune he has, and marry where he is attach'd, he might perhaps be happier. 


Countess. 
Happier! Were he mean enough to be happy so---contemptible thought!---I would see him in his grave rather.---But no more of this: have you seen Hovelberg? You say he is waiting below. 


Jean. 
Yes, Madam, and a friend with him; an Armenian Jew-merchant, who will, he says, go halves in his purchases, and enable him to give you a better price for the jewels, as he is himself rather low in cash at present. 


Countess. 
Well; I'll object to neither Jew nor Infidel that puts money into my pocket. 
(Holding up a ruby necklace.) 
This should fetch something considerable. 


Jean. 
O la, Madam! you won't part with that surely: your neck is like alabaster under it. [50]  Did you but know how they admired you at Prince Dormach's the last time you wore it.--- I would sell the very gown from my back ere I parted with it. 


Countess. 
So they admired me at Prince Dormach's then? 


Jean. 
O dear, my Lady! the Prince's valet told me, though two young beauties from 

[Page 208 ] 

Brussels were there, nobody spoke of any one but you. 


Countess. 
Well; to please thee, then, I'll keep it. 


Jean. 
La! here is a little emerald ring, my Lady; those brokers will despise such a trifle, and give you a mere nothing for it.---La, who would think it! it fits my fingers to a hair. It must be a mort too large for your delicate hand. 


Countess. 
Keep it for thyself then, since it fits thee. He was a great fool who gave it me, and had it made of that awkward size. 


Jean. 
I thank you, my Lady; I wish you would give me every thing in this precious casket that has not been the gift of a sage. 


Countess. 
Thou art right, Child. It would put many a hundred louis-d'ors into thy pocket, [75]  and leave scarcely a marverdi for myself.---A rich Knight of Malta gave me these 
(holding up a string of pearls) 
, whose bandy legs were trick'd out most delicately in fine-clocked hose of the nicest and richest embroidery. Rest his soul! I made as much of those legs as the hosier did. 


Jean. 
I doubt it not, Madam, and deserved what you earned full as well. 



Countess. (looking again at her pearls) 
There is not a flaw in any one of them. 


Jean. 
Aye; commend me to such legs! had they been straighter, the pearls had been worse. 


Countess. 
This amber box with brilliants I had from an old croacking Marquis, who pestered 

[Page 209 ] 

every music room in the principality to the day of his death, with notes that would have frightened a peacock. As long as he sang, poor man! I considered myself as having a salary on the musical establishment at the rate of two hundred ducats per month. 


Jean. 
Aye; God send that all the old Marquises in these parts, would croak for us at this rate. 


Countess. 
I have no reason to complain: my [100]  present friend bleeds as freely as any of his predecessors. 


Jean. 
So he should, my Lady. Such nonsense as he writes ought not to be praised for a trifle. I would not do it, I'm sure. 


Countess. 
Dost thou ever praise then for profit? 


Jean. 
To be honest with you, Madam, I have done it, as who has not? But never since I entered your Ladyship's service; for why should you reward me for praising you, when all the world does it for nothing?---No, no, my Lady; you are too wise for that. 


Countess. 
There is somebody at the door. 


Jean. 
It is Hovelberg. 


Countess. 
Open then, but let nobody else in. 

( Jean. opens the door, and Hovelberg enters, followed by Baron Baurchel , disguised as an Armenian Jew.) 



Countess. 
I am happy to see you, dear Hovelberg; and this Gentleman also, 
(curtesying to the Bar. ) 
I know it is only a friend whom we 

[Page 210 ] 

may trust, that you would introduce to me on the present occasion. 


Hov. 
To be sure, Madam: a friend we may depend on. 
(Drawing Countess aside, and speaking in her ear) 
A man of few words: better to do in this quarter than this. 
(Pointing first to his pocket, and then to his head.) 
And that is a [125]  good man, you know, to be well with. 


Countess. 
O the best stuff in the world for making a friend of. 
(Returning to the Bar. ) 
Sir, I have the highest regard and esteem for you. 



Bar. (in a feigned voice) 
On vatch account, Madam? 


Countess. 
O good Sir! on every account. 


Baron. 
You lov'sh not my religion? 


Countess. 
I respect and reverence it profoundly. 


Bar. 
You lov'sh not my pershon? 


Countess. 
It is interesting and engaging, most assuredly. 


Bar. 
No body telsh me sho before. 


Countess. 
Because the world is full of envious people, who will not tell you truths that are agreeable. 



Bar. (nodding assent) 
Now I understant. 


Countess. 
Yes, dear Sir; you must do so; your understanding is unquestionable. 
(Looking archly to Hovel. ) 
And now, Gentlemen, do me the honour to be seated, and examine these jewels attentively. 


Hov. 
We would rather stand if you'll permit us. 


[Page 211 ] 




Countess. (aside to Hovel. , while the Baron examines the jewels) 
My dear Hovelberg, be [150]  liberal; for the sum I want is a large one, and those jewels would procure it for me any where; only, regarding you as my friend, I give you the first offer.---But your friend, methinks, examines every thing with great curiosity. 


Hov. 
Yes, poor man! he likes to appear as knowing as he can: this is but natural, you know, when one is deficient in the upper department. ---But he'll pay like a Prince, if you flatter and amuse him. 


Bar. 
Vasht fine stones! Vasht pretty ornaments! 
(To Countess ) 
You dishposhe of all deshe? 


Countess. 
Yes, every thing. 


Bar. 
Dere be gifsh here, no doubt, from de dear friensh. 


Hov. 
Or some favoured lover, perhaps. 



Countess. (sighing affectedly) 
Perhaps so; but I must part with them all. 



Bar. (aside to Hov. ) 
Nay, she has some tenderness for me: put her not to too severe a trial. 



Hov. (aside) 
We shall see. 



Bar. (returning to Countess ) 
You be woman; and all womansh have de affections for some one [175]  lover or frient. 


Countess. 
O how good and amiable and considerate you are! I have indeed a heart formed for tenderness. 


[Page 212 ] 




Bar. (drawing Hovel. aside again) 
She does love me, Hovelberg: tempt her not with an extravagant price for the picture. 



Hov. (aside) 
I'll take a better way of managing it. 
(Returning to the Countess ) 
My Friend desires me to say, Madam, that, if there is any thing here you particularly value, he'll advance you money upon it, which you may pay at your leisure, and you shall preserve it. 



Countess. (to Baron ) 
How generous you are, my dear Sir! Yes; there is one thing I would keep. 



Bar. (eagerly) 
One ting---dere be one ting: tish picture, perhaps. 


Countess. 
This ruby necklace. 


Bar. 
You sell tish picture, den? 


Countess. 
To be sure, if you'll purchase it. 


Hov. 
The diamonds are valuable, indeed; but you will not sell the painting? 


Countess. 
That will depend on the price you offer for it. 


Hov. 
[200]  Being a portrait, it is of no value at all, but to those who have a regard for the original. 


Jean. 
And what part of the world do they live in, Mr. Hovelberg? Can you find them out any where? 


Countess. 
Nay, peace, Jeanetta.---As a portrait, indeed, it is of no value to any body, but, as a characteristic old head, it should fetch a good price. 
(Shewing it to Baron ) 
Observe, my dear Sir, that air of conceit and absurdity 

[Page 213 ] 

over the whole figure: to those who have a taste for the whimsical and ridiculous, it would be invaluable. Don't you perceive it? 


Bar. 
Not very sure. 


Countess. 
Not sure! Look at it again. See how the eyes are turned languishingly aside, as if he were repeating, "Dear gentle idol of a heart too fond." 
(Mimicking the Baron's natural voice.) 


Hov. 
Ha, ha, ha! Your mimickry is excellent, Countess. Is it not, Friend Johnadab? 


Bar. 
O, vasht comical. 



Hov. (aside to him) 
She has a good talent. 



Bar. (aside) 
Shrewd witch! The words of my last sonnet, indeed; but I did not repeat them so. 



Hov. (aloud) 
[225]  Though you are an admirable mimick, Madam, my Friend Johnadab does not think your imitation of the Baron entirely correct. 



Countess. (alarmed) 
He knows the Baron, then; I have been very imprudent.---But pray don't suppose I meant any disrespect to the worthy Baron, whom I esteem very much. 


Bar. 
O vasht much! 


Hov. 
Be not uneasy, Madam; my Friend will be secret, and loves a joke mightily. 


Countess. 
I'll trust, then, to his honour: and since he does not like my imitation of the Baron, he shall have it from one who does it better than I. Jeanetta, amuse this worthy gentleman by repeating the Baron's last sonnet. 


[Page 214 ] 



Jean. 
Nay, my Lady, you make me do it so often, I'm tired of taking him off. 


Countess. 
Do as you are bid, Child. 

Jean. 
"Dear gentle idol of a heart too fond, 
"Why doth that eye of sweetest sympathy---" 

Hov. 
Ha, ha, ha! Excellent! 


Bar. (off his guard) 
By Heaven, this is too bad! Your servants taught to turn me into ridicule! 



Countess. (starting) 
[250]  How's this? Mercy on me! 


Hov. 
Be not alarmed, Countess; I thought he would surprise you. My Friend is the best mimick in Europe. 


Countess. 
I can scarcely recover my surprise. 
(To Baron ) 
My dear Sir, I cannot praise you enough. You have a wonderful talent. The Baron's own mouth could not utter his voice more perfectly than yours. 



Bar. (pulling off his cap and beard) 
No, Madam, not easily. 
( Jean. shrieks out, and the Countess stands in stupid amazement.) 
This disguise, Madam, has procured for me a specimen of the amiable dispositions of a heart formed for tenderness, with a sample of your talents for mimickry into the bargain; and so I wish you good day, with thanks for my morning's amusement. 



Countess. (recovering herself) 
Ha, ha, ha! You understand mumming very well, Baron, but I still better. I acted my part well. 


[Page 215 ] 



Bar. 
Better than well, Madam: it was the counter-part of my enacting the Baron. 


Jean. 
Indeed, dear Baron, the Countess knew it was you, and so did I too. Indeed, indeed [275]  we did. I'm sure it is a very good joke: I wonder we don't laugh more at it than we do. 


Bar. 
Be quiet, subordinate Imp of this arch Tempter! My thraldom is at an end; and all the jewels in that shameful heap were not too great a price for such emancipation. 
(Bowing very low to Countess ) 
Adieu most amiable, most sentimental, most disinterested of women! 

                                         [Exit. 


Countess. 
Hovelberg, you have betrayed me. 


Hov. 
How so, Madam? You told me yourself you were the most sincere woman in the world; the Baron doubted your regard for him; how could I then dissuade him from putting it to the proof, unless I had doubted your word, Madam? An insult you could never have pardoned. 


Countess. 
What, you laugh at me, too, you villain! 
(Exit Hovel. ) 
Oh! I am ruined, derided and betrayed! 
(Throws herself into a chair, covering her face with her hand, while Jeanetta endeavours to comfort her.) 


Jean. 
Be not so cast down, my Lady, there are more than one rich fool in the world, and you have a good knack at finding them out. 


Countess. 
O, that I should have been so unguarded! That I should never have suspected! 


[Page 216 ] 



Jean. 
Aye, with his vasht this, and his vasht [300]  that: it was, as he said, vasht comical that we did not. 


Countess. 
Bring not his detested words again to my ears; I can't endure the sound of them. 

Enter Valdemere . 



Vald. 
Well, Madam, you can answer my demands now, I hope: Hovelberg has been with you. Money, money, my dear mother! 
(Holding out his hand) 
There is a fair broad palm to receive it; and here 
(kissing her hand coaxingly) 
is a sweet little hand to bestow it. 



Countess. (pushing him away sternly) 
Thy inconsiderate prodigality has been most disastrous, Had'st thou been less thoughtless, less profuse--- a small portion of prudence and economy would have made us independent of every dotard's humour. 


Vald. 
Notable virtues indeed, Madam; but where was I to learn them pray? Did you ever before recommend them to me, by either precept or example? Prudence! Economy! What has befallen you? I'm sure there is something wrong, when such words come from your lips. ---Ha! in tears, too! Hovelberg has brought no money then? 


Countess. 
No, no, Barbarian! He has ruined [325]  me. 


Vald. 
How so? 


Countess. 
I cannot tell thee: it would suffocate me. 


[Page 217 ] 



Jean. 
La, Count! My Lady may well call him Barbarian. He brought the old Baron with him to purchase the jewels, disguised like an Armenian Jew; and when bargaining with her for his own picture, my Lady said something of the original not much to his liking, and so the old fool tore off his disguise and bounced out of the room in a great passion. 


Vald. 
By my faith, this is unlucky! I depended on touching 500 louis d'ors immediately. 


Countess. 
Thinking only of yourself still, when you may well guess how I am distressed.---I shall never again find such a liberal old cully as he. 


Vald. 
Yes you will, Mother: more readily than I shall find the 500 louis.---I owe half that sum to Count Pugstoff, for losses at the billiard table; all the velvet and embroidery, the defunct suits of two passing years haunt me wherever I go, in the form of unmannerly taylors: and, besides all this, there is a sweet pretty Arabian in the stables of Huckston, my [350]  jockey, that I am dying to be master of.---By my faith, it is very hard! Had you no suspicion? How came you to be so much off your guard? 


Countess. 
I believe it was fated to be so, and therefore I was blinded for the moment. I dreamt last night that I had but one tooth in my head, and it dropped on the ground at my feet. This, it is said, betokens the loss of a friend by death, and I trembled for thee, my Child; but 

[Page 218 ] 

now, too surely, my dream is explained and accomplished. 


Vald. 
And, methinks, you would have preferred the first interpretation. 


Countess. 
Ah! ungrateful Boy! You know too well how I have doated on you. 


Vald. 
I do know too well: it has done me little good, I fear. 


Countess. 
It has done me little good, I'm sure, since this is all the gratitude thou hast. I should never, but for thee, have become the flatterer of those I despise, to amass those odious jewels. 


Vald. 
Ha! the jewels are still here then! I shall have my louis' still. Thank you, dear Mother, that you did not part with them, at least. 
(Kissing her hand hastily, and running to the table) 
[375]  I'll soon dispose of them all. 



Countess. (running after him) 
No, no! not so fast, Valdemere: thou wilt not take them all. Haste thee, Jeanetta, and save some of them. 

(They all scramble round the table for the jewels, and the scene closes.) 



[Page 219 ] 


ACT III. 

Scene 1 

Scene before the Gate of the Castle. Enter Nina , who crosses the Stage timidly, stopping once or twice, and then, with hesitation, giving a gentle knock at the Gate. Enter Porter from the Gate, which he opens. 




Porter (after waiting to hear her speak) 
What do you want, young woman? Did you only knock for amusement? 


Nin. 
No, Sir; is Count Valdemere in the castle? I would speak with him, if he is at leisure. 


Port. 
He is in the castle; but as to speaking with him, no man, of less consequence than his valet, can answer that question. 
Enter Lorimore , by the opposite side. 

Here he is. You come opportunely, Mr. Lorimore; this young person would speak with your Master. 



Lor. (aside) 
O, Nina, I see. 
(Aloud) 
How do you do, my pretty Nina? You can't speak with my Master, indeed; but you may speak with the next most agreeable personage in these parts, my Master's man, as long as you please; and that, be assured, is a far better thing for your purpose, my Princess. 


[Page 220 ] 



Nin. 
Dare you insult me? You durst not once have done it.---I do not ask then to see him; but give him this letter. 



Lor. (taking the letter) 
Do you wish this precious piece to be read, Child, or to be burnt? 


Nin. 
Why ask that? To be read, certainly. 


Lor. 
[25]  I must not give it to the Count, then, but keep it to myself: and if you'll just allow me to make the slight alteration of putting Lorimore the valet for Valdemere the master, as I read, it will be a very pretty, reasonable letter, and one that may advance your honour withal. 


Nin. 
Audacious Coxcomb! Give it me again. 
(Snatches the letter from him, and turns away.) 


Lor. 
She is as proud as that little devil of a Page, her brother. 

(Enter Page behind from the gate.) 



Page. 
The more devil he be, the fitter company for you. Whom spoke you to? 
(Seeing Nina ) 
Oh, oh! Is Nina here!---Nina, Nina! 
(Running after her.) 



Nin. (returning) 
My dear Theodore, is it thee? I did not ask for thee, lest thou should'st chide me for coming to the castle. 


Page. 
I won't chide, but I'm sorry to see thee here. Fie, Woman! thou art the daughter of as brave an Officer, though a poor one, as any in the service; art thou not ashamed to come, thus meanly, after a lover who despises thee? 


[Page 221 ] 



Nin. 
He promised to marry me. 


Page. 
He promised a fiddle-stick! Poor deluded simpleton! 


Nin. 
[50]  Ah, dost thou chide me, boy as thou art? 


Page. 
Who is there to chide thee now, when both our parents are dead? But as they would have done so do I, Sister; I chide thee, and love thee too.---Go now; return to the good woman from whose house thou hast stolen away, and I'll buy thee a new gown as soon as my quarter's salary is paid me. 


Nin. 
Silly child, what care I for a new gown? But if thou hast any pity for me, give this letter to thy master. 


Page. 
I will, I will: but go thy ways now; there is a gentleman coming. And do, dear Nina, return no more to the castle till I send thee word. Good be with thee, poor Simpleton! 

[ Exit Nina , and enter Dartz by the opposite side. 



Dart. 
Is it thy sister thou hast parted from? I met her in the wood this morning; she need not avoid me now. 


Page. 
Let her go, Sir; the farther she is from the castle the better. 


Dart. 
Thou hast a letter in thy hand. 


Page. 
Yes, Sir. 


Dart. 
Which thou art to give to the Count. 


Page. 
No, Sir; I'll see him choked first. 

                                         (Tearing the letter.) 


[Page 222 ] 



Dart. 
[75]  Nay, see what it contains ere thou destroyest it. 



Page. (putting it together again and reading it) 
Only upbraiding his unkindness, and stuff of that sort, with some nonsense about a dream she has had, which makes her afraid she shall never see him again. 


Dart. 
Let me look. 
(After reading it) 
This letter may be useful. Come with me, my little friend; and we'll devise a way of revenging thy sister on her cruel seducer. 


Page. 
Will you? I'll worship you like a saint of the calendar if you do this. 



Dart. (considering) 
Is not your master somewhat superstitious? 


Page. 
Marry is he! but mightily afraid to be thought so. He laughed at me when the bad fever prevailed for wearing a charm on my breast against infection; but the very next night, when he went to bed, what should drop out think you, as he opened his vest, but the very same charm which he had procured immediately, and worn with such secrecy, that even Valet Lorimore knew nothing of the matter. 


Dart. 
This is good; come with me, and I'll instruct thee what to do with thy letter. 

                                         [Exeunt. 


[Page 223 ] 


SCENE II. 

Valdemere 's Dressing-Room: Enter Page treading softly on tiptoe, and looking about the Room. 



Page. 
Aye; the coast is clear, and the door of his chamber is a-jar; now is my time. 
(Pulling the torn letter from his pocket, and stamping on the floor as he raises his voice) 
There, cursed letter, I'll make an end of thee! Give thee to my master, indeed! I'll give thee to the devil first. 
(Pretending to tear the letter, and strew the pieces about, while Valdemere looking from the door of his chamber, steals behind him and seizes his hands with the remainder of the letter in them.) 
Mercy on me! is it you, my Lord? 


Vald. 
What art thou doing? What scares thee so? What letter is this? Let me see it. 


Page. 
O no, my Lord, I beseech you, for your own sake, don't read it. 


Vald. 
Why should not I read it, Boy? 


Page. 
Lud, I don't know! you may not mind it, perhaps; but were any body to send such a letter to me, I should be mainly terrified. To be sure, death comes, as they say, at his own time, and we can't keep him away, though we should hang ourselves; but one don't like to be told before-hand the very year or day we are to die, neither. 


Vald. 
The year and day! give me the letter: give it me immediately. 
(Snatching the fragments 

[Page 224 ] 

of the letter from him, and picking up a piece or two from the floor, which he puts together hastily on a table near the front of the stage.) 
I can't make it piece any way. 


Page. 
[25]  So much the better, my Lord: don't try to do it. 


Vald. 
It is Nina's hand, I see, but I can make no sense of it.---Aye, now it will do 
(reading) 
"I have been terrified with a dream, and fear I shall see you no more." But where is the dream; it is torn off; give it me. 


Page. 
I have it not. 


Vald. 
Thou liest! give it me, I say. 


Page. 
Lud have mercy! as I tore it off just now, your black spaniel ran away with it. 


Vald. 
No, varlet! that is a sham; go find it; thou knowest where it is well enough. 


Page. 
Indeed, my Lord, if it is not in the black spaniel's custody it is no where else that I know of. 



Vald. (reading again) 
I fear I shall see you no more! But it may be her own death as well as mine, that her dream has foretold; and therefore she may see me no more. 


Page. 
Very true, you had better think so; though it does not often happen that a woman is killed at a siege. 


Vald. 
At a siege! 


Page. 
Pest take this hasty tongue of mine; I [50]  could bite it off for the tricks it plays me. 


Vald. 
At a siege! 


Page. 
O, never mind it, Sir. It may be some 

[Page 225 ] 

lie after all: some wicked invention to make you afraid. 



Vald. (sternly) 
What sayest thou? 


Page. 
O no! I don't mean afraid; only uneasy as it were---no no! not uneasy neither; only somewhat as you feel at present, my Lord; you know best what to call it. 


Vald. 
At a siege! 


Page. 
Dear my Lord; those words are glued to your tongue. 



Vald. (not heeding him) 
My grandfather perished at a siege, and his grandfather also: is this fate decreed in our family for alternate generations? 
(Sinks into a chair by the table, and Page seeing him so much absorded, comes close to him, staring curiously in his face.) 


Vald. 
Take thy varlet's face out of my sight; why art thou so near me? Leave the room, I say. 
                                         [ Exit Page. 

                                         (Rising, and pacing to and fro as he speaks to himself.) 
A hundred dreams prove false for one that prefigures any real event.---It should not have been however: my mother should have found for me some other occupation than a military life.---Quit it? No; I can't do that: the [75]  world would cry out upon me; Livia would despise me.---'Tis a strange thing that women, who can't fight themselves, should so eagerly push us to the work.---Pooh! am I a fool that it seizes me thus?---I would this boy, however, had really destroyed the letter. 


[Page 226 ] 


                                         (Enter Dartz , looking at Vald. some time before he speaks.) 



Dart. (aside) 
This will do; it is working with him. 
(Aloud, advancing) 
My dear Count;---but don't start; I bring no bad tidings; I come to beg a favour of you. 



Vald. (recovering himself) 
Say you are come to oblige me. 


Dart. 
I thank you, Valdemere: but faith I'm ashamed to mention it; you will laugh at me for being so superstitious. 


Vald. 
Ha! somebody has been dreaming about you too. 


Dart. 
Should you deem me very credulous if a thing of this nature had power to disturb me? 


Vald. 
'Tis even so; they have been dreaming all over the house. Ha, ha, ha! And thou art really uneasy about such flummery as this: ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha! This is admirable---delightful! ---ha, ha, ha, ha! 


Dart. 
Be more moderate with your merriment: [100]  your tears and your laughter come so strangely together, one would take you for an hysterical girl. 


Vald. 
I can't chuse but laugh at your dreamers; ha, ha, ha! 


Dart. 
Don't laugh at me then; for I'm neither a dreamer, nor believer in dreams. 



Vald. (becoming serious at once) 
No; what is it then? 


Dart. 
I'm almost ashamed to tell you, yet I'll throw myself on your mercy and do it.---I am 

[Page 227 ] 

in love then, and fearful of the fortunes of war; for you know we must expect sharp fighting this ensuing campaign. 



Vald. (ruefully) 
You think so? 


Dart. 
I'm certain of it. Now, though I have no faith in dreams, I must own I have some in fortune-tellers; and there is a famous one just come to the castle, whom I would gladly consult. Will you permit me to bring him to your inner apartment there; that he may tell me of my future destiny, whatever his art may reveal to him? Laugh as you please, but refuse me not this favour; for there is no other room in the castle where I can meet him, secure from [125]  interruption. 



Vald. (smiling affectedly) 
And thou art really in earnest with this folly? 


Dart. 
When you have heard the wonderful things this wizard has foretold, you will not call it folly. 


Vald. 
Can'st thou tell me any of them? 


Dart. 
Take a turn with me on the terrace, and thou shalt hear things that will astonish thee. 


Vald. 
Ha ha! it is whimsical to see thee so serious. Such stories are pleasant amusement: I'll attend thee most willingly. 

                                         [Exeunt. 


[Page 228 ] 


ACT IV. 

SCENE I. 

---A small Room in Valdemere's Apartments; Baron Baurchel is discovered in the Disguise of a Fortune-teller, with Dartz standing by him, adjusting part of his Dress. 



Dart. 
'Twill do well enough. Stand majestically by this great chair, with your worsted robe thrown over the arm of it; it will spread out your figure, and make it more imposing.---Bravo! You assume the astrological dignity to admiration; the rolling of your eyes under that black hood almost appals me. Be as good an astrologer as you have been an Armenian Jew, Baron, and we shall be triumphant. 


Bar. 
As good, Dartz! If I am not a dolt, I shall be better: for there is no danger of losing my temper now; and being fairly engaged in it, methinks I could assume as many shapes as Proteus, to be revenged on this false Hyena and her detestible cub. 


Dart. 
Aye, that is your true spirit. But I must leave you now, and wait in the anti-room for the Count, who will be here presently. 

                                         [Exit. 



Bar. (after musing some time) 
Superlative baseness and ingratitude! That sonnet, of all the sonnets I ever wrote, is the most exquisitely feeling 

[Page 229 ] 

and tender.---When I read it to her, she wept. ---Were her tears feigned?---I can't believe it. ---Assassins will weep at a high-wrought scene of [25]  tragedy, and cut the author's throat when it is over.---Even so.---It suited her purposes better to laugh at my verses, than acknowledge their genuine effect; and so, forgetting every kindness she owed me,---O the detestable worlding! I'll---Hush, hush, hush! they are coming. 

(Re-enter Dartz , followed by Valdemere , who walks shrinkingly behind, peeping past his shoulder to the Baron , who slightly inclines his body, putting his hand with great solemnity three times to his forehead.) 




Dart. (aside to Vald. after a pause) 
Faith, Valdemere, I dare scarcely speak to him; 'tis well you are with me; will you speak to him? 


Vald. 
No; 'tis your own affair; stand to it yourself. 



Dart. (aloud) 
Learned and gifted Mortal, we come to thee. 



Vald. (aside, jogging his arm) 
Don't say we --- 'tis your own affair entirely. 


Dart. 
Well, I should say, gifted Sage, not we but I come to thee, to know what fortune is abiding me in this up-and-down world. I am a lover and a soldier, and liable, as both, to great vicissitudes. 


Bar. 
Thou say'st truly, my Son. And who is 

[Page 230 ] 

this young man so much wiser than thyself, who does not desire to look into futurity? 


Dart. 
It is my friend. 



Bar. (after examining the faces of both for some time) 
[50]  Say more than friend. 


Dart. 
How so? 



Bar. (still continuing to gaze alternately at them) 
'Tis very wonderful: in all the years of my occult experience, I never met the like before, but once. 



Vald. (aside to Dart. ) 
What does he mean? Ask him, Man. 


Dart. 
You never met the like but once! What mean you, Father? 



Bar. (answers not, but continues to look at them, while Vald. , unable to bear it longer, shrinks again behind Dart. ) 
Shrink not back, young Man: my eyes make not the fate they see, and cannot do you harm.---'Tis wonderful! There is not in your two faces one trait of resemblance, yet your fortunes in the self-same mould are cast: ye are in fate twin-brothers. 


Dart. 
Indeed! then my friend need only listen to my fortune, and he'll have his own into the bargain. 


Bar. 
Nay, nay, my Sons, be advised, and enquire not into futurity. They are the happiest men, who have fewest dealings with such miserable beings as myself. Beings who are compelled to know the impending evils of hapless humanity, without the power of averting them. Be advised, and suppress unprofitable curiosity. 


[Page 231 ] 



Dart. 
[75]  By my say, Sage! I cannot suppress it. 


Bar. 
Then let your friend go. He is wise enough not to wish to know his future fate, and I have already said, you are in this twin-brothers. 


Dart. 
Retire then, Valdemere. 



Vald. (agitated and irresolute) 
I had better, perhaps.---Yet there is within me a strange and perverse craving---I will retire 
(going to the door, and stopping short) 
. Live in fearful ignorance, fancying evils that may never be! 'Twere better to know all at once. 
(Returning.) 
Is it our general fortunes only, or is there some particular circumstance of our fate, now present to your mind, of which you advise us to be ignorant? 


Bar. 
There is--- 



Vald. (pulling Dart. by the arm) 
Come away; come away; don't hear it. 


Dart. 
I am bound by some spell; I must stay to hear it. 


Vald. 
I am certainly bound also; I know not how it is; I must hear it too. 


Baur. 
Be it as you will. 
(After writing characters on a table, with other mummeries,) 
Propose your questions. 


Dart. 
[100]  The name, age and quality, of her who is my love. 
( Bar. writes again) 
The initials of her name I protest, and her age to a day, nineteen years and a half. And her quality, good Father? 


Bar. 
Only daughter and heiress of an eminent Dutch butter-dealer. 


[Page 232 ] 



Dart. 
Nay, you are scarcely right there, Sage; you might at least have called him Burgo-master. ---But let it pass. She loves me, I hope. 
( Bur. nods.) 
I knew it. And now let me know if she shall ever be my wife; and how many children we shall have. 



Vald. (aside to Dart. ) 
Deuce take wife and children too! What is all this drivling for? 



Dart. (aside to him) 
I thought you were in love as well as myself. 


Vald. 
So I am; but be satisfied that she loves you, and pass on to things of deeper import. 



Dart. (aside) 
Can any thing be of deeper import? 
(Aloud) 
I should like very well, gifted Father, to have two or three black-haired burly knaves, and a little fair damsel to play with. 



Vald. (aside to Dart. ) 
Would they were all drowned in a horse-pond! Look how ruefully [125]  the Sage shakes his head at thee: wife or children thou wilt never have. 


Dart. 
Shall I never be married, Father? What shall prevent it? 


Bar. 
Death. 


Dart. 
Shall I lose her? 
(Turning to Vald. ) 
Do you not tremble for Livia? 


Vald. 
Is it her death? Did he say so? Ask him. 


Bar. 
Death will prevent it.---Let me leave you. 



Vald. (seizing the Baron 's robe) 
Whose death? Whose death? Is it only the Lady's? 


Bar. 
Nay, do not detain me. There is a deep depression on my mind. Good-night to 

[Page 233 ] 

you! I'll tell you the remainder when you are better prepared to hear it. 


Dart. 
No no! the present time is the best. 



Vald. (in a feeble voice) 
You had better let him go. 



Dart. (catching hold of the Bar. ) 
You must not leave us in this tremendous uncertainty. Whose death shall prevent my marriage? 


Bar. 
Let me examine, then. Stretch out your hand. 
( Dartz holds out his hand, and Vald. involuntarily does the same, but draws it back again as Bar. begins to inspect it.) 
Nay, [150]  don't draw back your hand: I must examine both palms to see if the line of death be there. 


Dart. 
The line of death must be on every man's hand. 


Bar. 
But if it be early or impending death, the waving of the shroud will lie across it. 
( Vald. shudders and turns away his head, and the Bar. , after looking at both their hands, starts back from them, and shakes his head piteously.) 


Dart. 
What is the matter, Father? What is the matter? 


Bar. 
Ask not; I will not tell what I know; nothing shall compel me. 

                                         [ Exit hastily. 



Vald. (turning round) 
Is he gone? Went he by the door? 


Dart. 
What way he went, I know not. He has vanished I believe: did you hear his steps on the floor? 


Vald. 
I heard nothing. 


[Page 234 ] 




Dart. (after a short pause) 
How do you feel, Count? 


Vald. 
Ha! do you feel it too? 


Dart. 
Feel what? 


Vald. 
As if a cold shroud were drawn over you. 


Dart. 
Aye, so I think I do.---But never mind it: we may still have some good months or weeks before us; let us go to the banquet [175]  and put a merry face upon it: a cup of wine will warm us again. What, though my grandam dreamt at my birth that I should be slain in a breach, and the weird witch of Croningberg confirmed it: I'll live and be merry while I may. 


Vald. 
Ha! and thy grandam had such a dream! 


Dart. 
Never mind it: a cup of wine will soon cheer us again. 


Vald. 
Would to God I had one now! 


Dart. 
You have no time to take wine at present: I hear a bustle below; they are going to the grotto already.---Who's at the door? 
(Opens the door.) 
Your valet with your new suit for the banquet. I'll leave you then. 
( Exit Dartz , and enter Lorimore with a suit of cloaths over his arm, followed by Page .) 


Lor. 
I have waited this half hour, my Lord, to hear your bell, and the ladies are waiting for you to go to the grotto. Look at this coat, my Lord: the fashion of it is exquisite, and it has such an air with it; there is not, besides 

[Page 235 ] 

yourself, a man in the empire that would know how to wear it. 


Page. 
His consummate valet excepted. 


Lor. 
Hold your peace, Sirrah.---Look here, [200]  my Lord; if I had not myself given the tailor a few hints, he could never have had genius enough to finish it in this style. I'd give a ducat that the Marquis De Florimel's valet could see it. He pretends---But you don't look at it, my Lord: what is the matter with you? 



Vald. (eagerly) 
Is any thing the matter? 


Lor. 
Nothing, my Lord; but the ladies are waiting for you to go with them to the grotto: won't you be pleased to put on your new coat? 


Vald. 
Put it on then. 
(Stretching out his arms to put on the coat.) 


Lor. 
But we must first take off the old coat. 


Vald. 
I forgot that. 
(Trying to pull off his coat.) 
It sticks strangely to me: d'off it if thou can'st. 



Lor. (after pulling off his coat) 
Now, my Lord, thrust your arm into this beautiful sleeve; the whole beau monde of Paris can't shew you its fellow.---That is the wrong arm, my Lord. 


Vald. 
It will do; it will do. 


Lor. 
Pardon me, my Lord; your left arm won't do for the right sleeve of the coat. 



Vald. (holding out his other arm, and fumbling some time) 
There is no hole at all to put my arm into. 


[Page 236 ] 



Lor. 
[225]  Nay you push your hand past it; here; here. 


Vald. 
Where sayest thou? 'Tis mightily perplexed. 



Page. (aside to himself) 
Either the coat or the coat's master is perplexed enough. 
(Aloud, offering him his hat) 
You won't go, my Lord, without your new hat and plume. 


Vald. 
Plume? 


Page. 
Yes, my Lord, and it will wave so handsomely too, for the company walk by torch-light in procession. 


Vald. 
Let them move on, and I'll follow. 


Page. 
No, they can't go without you, my Lord. 


Vald. 
How is it? Am I one of the pall-bearers? 


Page. 
It is not a funeral, my Lord. 


Vald. 
I forgot; the chillness of the night has bewildered me. 


Lor. 
You are not well, my Lord; what is the matter with you? 


Vald. 
Nothing, leave me alone for a little. 


Lor. 
Will you not join the company? The procession is prepared to set out. 


Vald. 
Aye, very true; tell me when they move the body, and I'll follow it. 


Page. 
[250]  He, he, he! a funeral again. 


Lor. 
Unmannerly imp; what art thou snickering at? 
(To Vald. in a loud distinct voice) 
It is not a funeral, my Lord. The Lady Livia, and 

[Page 237 ] 

the Countess your mother, are going to the grotto, and are waiting impatiently below till you join them. 



Vald. (rubbing his forehead) 
It is so: how went it out of my head? That wine after dinner must have fuddled me. I'll join them immediately. 


Lor. 
Lean on me, my Lord; you are not well, I fear. 


Vald. 
No no! the fumes of that diabolical champaign have left my head now. 


Lor. 
It must have been mixed with some black drug, I think, to produce such a sombre intoxication. 


Page. 
It may rest in the cellar long enough for me; I'll none on't. 


Lor. 
Peace, young Sir; and go before with one of these lights. 

                                         [ Exeunt , Page lighting them. 

SCENE II. 

An arched Grotto, the Roof and Sides of which are crusted over with Shells and Corals, &c.; a Banquet set out, ornamented with Lamps and Festoons of Flowers. Enter Countess , led in by Dartz , and Livia by Valdemere , two other Ladies by the Baron and Walter Baurchel , Page and Attendants following. 



Liv. 
Welcome all to my sea-nymph's hall; and do me the honour to place yourselves at 

[Page 238 ] 

table, as best pleases your fancy, without ceremony. ---If you hear any sound without, 'tis but the rolling of forty fathom water over-head; and nothing can intrude on our merriment, but a whale, or a mermaid, or a dolphin. 


Walt. 
This same sea-nymph must have an ingenious art of cultivating roses in the bottom of the ocean. 


Liv. 
It must be a perfect contrivance indeed that escapes the correct taste of Mr. Walter Baurchel. Fruit and ices perhaps may likewise be an incongruity: shall I order them away, and feast you on salt-water and limpits? 


Bar. 
Aye, pickle him up with brine, in a corner by himself; for he has a secret sympathy with every thing uncherishing and pungent. 


Liv. 
Do me the honour to take your places. I can pretty well divine which of the ladies will be your charge, gentle Baron.---But how is this? The Countess and you exchange strange looks, methinks, as if you did not know one another. 


Bar. 
[25]  Some people exchange strange looks, fair Livia, from the opposite cause. 


Liv. 
I don't comprehend you: should you have preferred being in masks? That indeed would have been a less common amusement. 


Bar. 
By no means, Madam; the Countess and I meeting one another unmasked is a very uncommon one. 


Countess. 
You know best, Baron, as far as you 

[Page 239 ] 

are yourself concerned: you always appeared to me a good and amiable man, and a most tender and elegant poet. 


Bar. 
Of which, Madam, you always took great care to inform me, as a sincere and disinterested friend. 


Liv. 
Ha! what is all this? Poo, poo! take your places together as usual: a love-quarrel never mars merry-making. 


Walt. 
Yes, tender doves! let them smooth down their ruffled feathers by one another as sweetly as they can. Why should you, Madam, give yourself any uneasiness about it.---But the Count, methinks, is less sprightly than usual: there are no more love-quarrels, I hope, in the party. 



Liv. (looking at Vald. ) 
[50]  Indeed you are very silent: I have been too much occupied to observe it before. You don't like my grotto, I fear. 


Vald. 
Pardon me! I like it very well: I like it very much. 


Liv. 
But this is not your usual manner of expressing approbation. 


Vald. 
Is it not? you do me honour to remember it. 
(Speaking confusedly as the company sit down to table) 
My spirits are very---that is to say, not altogether, but considerably--- 


Dart. 
Low, Valdemere? 



Vald. (snatching up a glass and filling a bumper of wine, which he swallows hastily) 
No, Dartz; light as a feather. My tongue was so confoundedly 

[Page 240 ] 

parch'd: this wine is excellent 
(drinking another bumper) 
. There is more beauty in these decorations than I was aware of: the effect, the taste is incomparable. 
(Drinks again.) 
It is truly exquisite. 


Walt. 
The champaign you mean, Count? I should have guess'd as much. 


Vald. 
No no; the decorations.---Is it champaign? Let me judge of its flavour more considerately 
(drinks again) 
; upon honour it is fit [75]  for the table of a god.---But our hostess is a divinity, and 'tis nectar we quaff at her board.--- Wine! common earthly wine! I'll thrust any man thro' with my rapier that says it is but wine. 


Bar. 
Keep your courage for a better cause, Count. Report says the enemy are near us; and you may soon have the honour to exert it in defence of your divinity. 


Walt. 
Which will be a sacred war, you know, and will entitle you, perhaps, to the glory of martyrdom. 


Vald. 
The enemy? 


Walt. 
Aye, report says they are near us. 


Vald. 
Be it so: I shall be prepared for them 
(drinks again) 
. 



Dart. (aside to Walt. ) 
By my faith, he will be prepared for them, for he'll fill himself mortal drunk, and frustrate our project entirely. 
(Aside to Page ) 
Go, Boy, and bid them make haste: thou understand'st me? 



Page. (aside) 
Trust me for that: the Philistines shall be upon him immediately. 


[Page 241 ] 



Countess. 
Valdemere is immeasurably fond of war and of military glory, which the tenderness of a too fearful mother has hitherto with [100]  difficulty restrained; and in your cause, charming Livia, he will be enthusiastically devoted. 


Liv. 
I claim him then as my Knight, whene'er I stand in need of his valorous arms; though it may, perhaps, prove but a troublesome honour. 


Vald. 
It is an honour I would purchase--- aye, purchase with a thousand lives---I say it, divine Livia, with a thousand lives.--- Life!---life!---What is it? but the breath of a moment: I scorn it. 
(Getting up from table, and reeling about.) 
The enemy did they say? Let an host of them come: this sword shall devour every mother's son of them.---I'm prepared for them all. 



Bar. (aside to Dart. ) 
He is too well prepared; we were foolish to let him drink so much. 



Countess. (aside to Vald. ) 
Be seated again; you disturb the company. 



Vald. (still reeling about) 
Aye, divine Livia; but the breath of a moment; I scorn it. 

                                         (An alarm without: Re-enter Page ; as if much frightened.) 


Page. 
O my Lady Livia! O my Master! O gentles all! a party of the enemy is coming to attack the castle, and they'll murder every soul of us. 


Vald. 
Speak plainer, Wretch; what said'st [125]  thou? 


[Page 242 ] 




Page. (speaking loud in his ear) 
The enemy are coming to attack the castle. 


Vald. 
Thou liest. 


Page. 
I wish I did; but he will confirm my words. 

                                         (Pointing to a Servant who now enters in alarm.) 



Ser. (to Vald. ) 
He speaks truth, my Lord; they are approaching in great strength. 


Vald. 
Approaching! are they near us then? 


Page. 
Aye marry! too near. They beat no drum, as you may guess; but the heavy sound of their march strikes from the hollow ground most fearfully. 

                                         ( Valdemere becoming perfectly sober, stands confounded.) 



Liv. (and the Ladies , much alarmed) 
What shall we do? What will become of us? 


Dart. 
Have courage, Madam; have courage, Ladies; the valiant Valdemere is your defender; you have nothing to fear. 



Liv. (and Ladies crowding close to Vald. ) 
Aye, dear Count; our safety depends on you. Save us! Save us! We have no refuge but you. 
(All clamouring at once.) 


Vald. 
Hush, hush, hush! They'll hear you. 
(In a low choked voice.) 


Dart. 
Nay, don't whisper, Valdemere; they are not so near us yet. 


Bar. 
[150]  Rouse ye, Count, and give your orders for the defence of the castle immediately. 


Dart. 
We are ready to execute them, be they ever so daring. 


[Page 243 ] 



Walt. 
There is no time to be lost; your orders, Count: do you comprehend us? 


Vald. 
My orders! 


Dart. 
Your orders quickly. 


Vald. 
I am thinking---I was thinking--- 



Page. (aside.) 
How to save yourself I believe. 


Bar. 
Well, noble Count, what are your thoughts. 


Vald. 
I---I---I am considering--- 


Walt. 
Thought and consideration become a good Commander, with some spice of activity into the bargain. 


Dart. 
There is no time to deliberate; issue your orders immediately. Under such an able commander we may stand a siege of some days. 


Vald. 
A siege!---Aye, the very thing---and so suddenly! 


Page. 
You tremble, my Lord; shall I bring you drops? 


Countess. 
Thou liest, Boy; get thee gone! [175]  
(Aside to Vald. ) 
Are you beside yourself? Tell them what to do; they wait for your orders. 


Vald. 
I order them all to the walls. Haste, haste, 
(pushing off the Ladies who stand next him) 
and man them as well as you can. 


Bar. 
Woman them, you mean, Valdemere; these are Ladies you push. 


Countess. 
Nay; you crowd upon him too much---you confuse him: he is as brave as his sword, if you would leave off confounding him so. 


[Page 244 ] 



Liv. 
Dear Valdemere! What is the matter? Rouse yourself, rouse yourself! 
(A great alarm without.) 
Hear that sound: they are at hand; what shall we do? There is a vault by the side of this grotto, where we poor miserable women may be concealed, but--- 



Vald. (eagerly) 
Where is it? My duty is to take care of you, dear Livia: come, come with me, and I'll place you in security. 
(Catches hold of the Page in his hurry, and runs off with him.) 


Countess. 
Stop, stop! That is the Page you have got. Will you leave me behind you? 

                                         (As Vald. is about to drag the Page into a recess at the side of the stage, the Boy laughs outright, and he discovers his mistake.) 


Vald. 
Off, Wretch! Where is Livia; come, come, my Life! where are you? 
(Stretching out one hand to her, while his body bends eagerly the other way.) 


Liv. 
No, Count; I will not go. Alarm [200]  overcame me for the moment; but now I will enter the castle; and if the enemy should take it, they shall find me there in a situation becoming its Mistress. 


Omnes. 
Bravely said, Lady! Let us all to the castle. 


Dart. 
With or without a commander, we'll defend it to the last extremity. 



Countess. (going to Vald. and speaking in his ear, while she pulls him along with her) 
Come 

[Page 245 ] 

with the rest, or be disgraced for ever. Did I put a sword by your side, a cockade in your hat, for this? 

                                         (A still louder alarm without, and EXEUNT in great hurry and confusion.) 

SCENE III. 

A Grove by the Castle; the Scene darkened, and moving Lights seen through the Trees from the Castle, sometimes gleaming from the Battlements, and sometimes from the Windows: Enter Nina with a Peasant's Surtout over her Dress. 



Nin. 
O, if in this disguise I could but enter the castle! Alas! the company are gone in, and the gate is now shut. I'll wait here till daybreak. ---Woe is me! He past by me quickly, and heard me not when I spoke to him.---O mercy! Soldiers coming here! 
(Hides herself amongst some bushes.) 

Enter Bounce , followed by Soldiers . 



Bounce. 
Come, let us hector it here awhile: I'll warrant ye we make a noise that might do for the siege of Troy. 


1st Sold. 
Aye, you're a book-learned man, Corporal: you're always talking of that there siege. Could they throw a bomb in those days, or fire off an eighteen-pounder any better than ourselves? 

                                         (Firing heard without.) 


[Page 246 ] 



Bounce. 
Hark! our Comrades are at it on the other side: let us to it here at the same time. I'll warrant ye we'll make the fair Lady within, and my Lady's fair gentlewomen, and the village Cure himself, should he be of the party, cast up their eyes like boiled fish, and say ten pater-noster's in a breath. 

(Voices without.) 


                                         Hallo! hallo! Comrades! 
Who goes there? 
(Enter 2d Soldier and others.) 



2d Sold. 
What makes you so quiet, an' be [25]  hanged to you! An old woman with her spinning-wheel might be stationed here to as much purpose. I could not tell where to find you. 


Bounce. 
By my faith, 'tis the first time Corporal Bounce was ever accused of not making noise enough. Come; we'll give you a round shall make the whole principality tremble. 

                                         (They prepare to fire, when 3d Soldier enters in haste.) 


3d. Sold. 
Hold, there! Spare your powder for better purpose: an advanced corps of the enemy is coming in good earnest, and marching in haste to the castle. 


Bounce. 
So, we're to have real fighting then! Faith, Comrade, valiant as I am, a little sham thunder, and a good supper after it, would have pleased my humour full as well at this present time. Pest take it! They must open the gates 

[Page 247 ] 

and let us in. What gentlemen are in the castle? We have no officer to command us. 


3d Sold. 
The Chevalier Dartz is there, and Count Valdemere. 


Bounce. 
Ah! he's but a craven-bird, that same Count: a kind of Free-mason-soldier, for parades and processions, and the like. If the young Baron de Bertrand were there, we should be nobly commanded. 


3d Sold. 
[50]  Don't stand prating here; let us give the alarm to the rest of our Comrades, and get into the castle ere the enemy come up with us. 


Bounce. 
Come, then! But what moves amongst the bushes? 
(Pulling out Nina ) 
A girl, i'faith, disguised in a countryman's surtout. 


Nin. 
O dear---O mercy! Don't be angry with me: I'm a poor harmless creature. 


Bounce. 
Blessings on thee, pretty One! thou'rt harmless enough: don't think we're afraid of thee. Come away with us: we'll lodge thee safely in the castle.

ACT V. 

SCENE I. 

                                         ---A Hall in the Castle: Enter Livia and the Baron , talking as they enter. 


Liv. 
Yes , Baron; you and your friends have, by this plot of yours, taught me a severe lesson; and I thank you for it, though my own understanding ought to have made it unnecessary. 


Bar. 
Dear Livia; why should a young woman like you be so much affronted at finding her understanding---for you are mighty fond of that word understanding ---not quite infallible? At the age of 63, an age I shall henceforth honestly own I have attained, one is not surprised at some small deficiencies even in one's own understanding. One can then, as I shall henceforth do, give up the vanity of being a wise man. 


Liv. 
And a poet, too, Baron? That were too much to give up in one day. 


Bar. 
Posterity will settle that point, Madam, and I shall give myself very little concern about the matter. 


Liv. 
Which one can easily perceive is perfectly indifferent to you. 
(Noise without) 
What encreased noise is that? Since your poor victim is already sacrified, (for they tell me he is gone, 

[Page 249 ] 

[25]  on pretence of violent illness, to the vaults under the castle,) why continue this mock-war any longer? 

Enter Servant . 



Bar. 
By this man's looks one might suppose that our mockery had turned to earnest. 



Liv. (to Serv. ) 
What is the matter? 


Serv. 
A party of the real enemy, Madam, has come to attack the castle, and is now fighting with the Chevalier's men at the gate. 


Liv. 
Why did you not open the gate to receive the Chevalier's men? 


Serv. 
They called to us to get in; but we could not distinguish them from the enemy, who were close on their heels; so we let down the portcullis, a'nt please you, and they must fight it out under the walls as they can. 


Bar. 
Is the Chevalier in the castle? 


Serv. 
O lud, no, Sir! he sallied out by the postern with Mr. Walter Baurchel and some of the domestics, and is fighting with them like a devil. But his numbers are so small, we fear he must be beaten; and--- 


Liv. 
And how can we hold out with neither men, ammunition, nor provisions. Merciful Heaven deliver us! 

(Enter Maid-servants , wringing their hands.) 



Maids. 
[50]  O lud, lud! What will become of us? What will become of us? What shall we do? 


[Page 250 ] 



Bar. 
Any thing you please but stun us with such frantic clamour. Get off to your laundries and your store-rooms, and your dressing closets, and don't encrease the confusion here. 

                                         ( Exeunt Maids , clamouring and wringing their hands.) 


Liv. 
You are rough with those poor creatures; they are very much frightened. 


Bar. 
Not half so frightened as those who make less noise. They think it necessary to raise an out-cry, because they are women and it is expected from them. I have been long enough duped in this way; I have no patience with it now.---But I must go to the walls and try to be of use 
(going) 
. 

(Voice without) 
Succour! Succour! 


Liv. 
Ha! there is a welcome cry. 

Enter Jeanetta . 

Succour did they say? 


Jean. 
Yes, my Lady: a band of men come to relieve us; and their leader is charging the enemy so furiosly sword in hand!---the Chevalier, they said, fought like a devil; but he fights like forty devils. We have been looking down upon them by torch-light from the walls; and their swords flash, and their plumes nod, and [75]  their eyes glare in the light so gallantly, I could almost sally out myself and take a bout with them. 



Bar. (to Jean. ) 
Aye, Minx; thou'rt forward enough to do any thing. 


[Page 251 ] 



Liv. 
Nay, chide her not when she brings us good news.---Heaven be praised for this timely aid! What brave man has brought it to us? Dost thou know him, Jeanetta? 


Jean. 
No, Madam: for, thank God! his back is to us, and his face to the foe; but there is a smack in his air of the Baron de Bertrand. 


Bar. 
Ha! my brave Antonio! I'll be sworn it is he. Come; let us to the ramparts, and look down on the combatants. 


Liv. 
Heaven grant there be not much bloodshed!

SCENE II. 

A dark Vault: Enter Valdemere , followed by Page , carrying a torch in one hand, and his plumed Cap in the other. 




Vald. (after hurrying some paces onward, stops short, and looks wildly round him) 
Is there no passage this way? 


Page. 
No, my Lord; but you run marvellously fast for one so ill as you are: I could scarcely keep up with you: pray stop here awhile and take breath. 


Vald. 
Stop here, and that sound still behind me! 


Page. 
What sound? 


Vald. 
Did'st thou not hear the tread of heavy steps behind us? The trampling of a whole band?

It was but the sound of my feet following you. 


Vald. 
Only that. The castle is taken thou say'st, and the ruffians are in quest of me. 


Page. 
Aye, marry are they! Their savage leader says, as the old tale-book has it, that he'll have the heart's blood of Count Valdemere on his sword before he eat or sleep. 


Vald. 
His sword! 


Page. 
Aye, my Lord, a good heavy rapier I assure you; and he swears, since you have not fought like a man on the walls, he'll kill you [25]  like a rat in your hole. 


Vald. 
I am horribly beset! 


Page. 
Aye, hot work, my Lord; the big drops fall from your forehead, like a thunder shower. 


Vald. 
Thou liest; I am cold as the damp of a sepulchre. 


Page. 
And pale too, as the thing that lies within it. 



Vald. (listening) 
Hark, hark! they are coming. 


Page. 
I hear nothing. 


Vald. 
Thou dost! thou dost! lying Varlet, with that treacherous leer upon thy face: thou hast decoyed me here for destruction. 
(Catching him by the throat.) 


Page. 
For mercy, my Lord, let go your hold! I hear nothing, as I hope to be saved, but our own voices sounding again from the vaulted roof over our heads. 


[Page 253 ] 



Vald. 
Aye, it is vaulted; thou'rt right perhaps. ---This strange ringing in my ears will not suffer me to know the sounds that really are, from those are not.---Why dost thou grin so? I have a frenzy I believe; I know I am strangely disordered. It was not so with me yesterday. I could then---Dost thou grin still? Stand [50]  some paces off: why art thou always so near me? 



Page. (retiring to the opposite side of the stage) 
I had best perhaps: his hand has the gripe of a madman. 



Vald. (leans his back against the side-scene, pressing his temples tightly with both hands, and speaking low to himself) 
This horrible tumult of nature! it knows within itself the moments that precede its destruction. 


Page. 
I must let him rest for a time. 
(Pause.) 
---It is cold here doing nothing. 
(Puts on his cap.) 
---He moves not: his eyes have a fixed ghastly stare; truly he is ill. 
(Going up to him.) 
You are very ill, my Lord. 



Vald. (starting) 
Have mercy upon me! 


Page. 
Don't start, my Lord; it was I who spoke to you. 


Vald. 
Who art thou? 


Page. 
Your Page, my Lord. 


Vald. 
Ha! only thou! thy stature seemed gigantic. 


Page. 
This half-yard of plume in my cap, and your good fancy have made it so. 


[Page 254 ] 



Vald. 
Aye; thou wert unbonnetted before. Keep by me then, but don't speak to me. 
(Putting his hand again to his temples.) 


Page. 
Nay, I must ask what is the matter. You are very ill: what is the matter with [75]  you? 


Vald. 
There is a beating within me like the pendulum of a great clock. 


Page. 
Is it in your heart or your head, my Lord? 


Vald. 
Don't speak to me: it is every where. 


Page. 
Rest here a-while; they will not discover you. You are indeed very ill.---Are you worse? 


Vald. 
Speak not; my mouth is parched like a cinder; I can't answer thee. 


Page. 
I'll fetch you some water. 
(Going.) 



Vald. (springing across the stage after him) 
Not for the universe. 



Page. (aside) 
He's strong enough still I see. 
(Turning his ear to the entry of the vault.) 


Vald. 
Thou'rt listening; thou hear'st something. 


Page. 
By my faith they are coming now. 


Vald. 
Merciful heaven! where shall I run? 


Page. 
Where you please, my Lord. 



Vald. (hurrying two or three steps on, in a kind of groping way) 
The light fails me: I don't see where I am going. 


Page. 
Nay it burns very clearly; I fear it will discover where we are. 


Vald. 
Put it out! put it out for God's sake! 

[Page 255 ] 

---Where is it? 
(Seizes on the torch, puts it out stamping on it with his feet, then laying himself on the floor) 
[100]  I am gone---I am dead; tell them so for God's sake! 


Page. 
I shall tell but half a lie when I do. 

Enter Baron and Walter Baurchel with Soldier's Cloaks thrown over them, and Livia in the same Disguise with a military Cap drawn over her Eyes, a Servant preceding them with Torches. 




Liv. (shrinking back as she enters) 
Is he dead? 

( Page nods, and winks to her significantly.) 




Bar. (in a rough voice) 
Has the Caitiff escaped my sword? Have I thirsted for his blood in vain? 



Walt. (in a rough voice also) 
Is he really dead? I'll lay my hand on his breast, and feel if his heart beats. 


Page. 
O don't do that, gracious merciful Sir! You'll but defile your worshipful fingers in touching of a dead corse, which brings bad luck with it. 


Walt. 
Well then, Boy, I will not; but there are a couple of brawny knaves without, who are burying the dead for us; they shall come forthwith, and cast him into the pit with the rest. 


Page. 
O lud, no, Sir! don't do that, please your worshipful Goodness! What if he should come alive again? 


Walt. 
Never fear that: I'll draw this rapier cross his laced cravat, and make it secure. 



Vald. (starting up upon his knees) 
Mercy, 

[Page 256 ] 

mercy! slay not a dying man; let me breathe my last breath without violence. 



Liv. (covering her eyes, and turning away her head) 
[125]  Torment him no more, I beseech you! 

(Enter Antonio , and Dartz with his arm bound up.) 



Ant. 
Nay, Gentlemen, this is unfeeling, ungenerous, unmanly. Stand upon your feet, Count Valdemere 
(raising him up), 
there are none but friends near you, if friends they may be called, who have played you such an abominable trick. 


Vald. 
How is this? Art thou Antonio? Where are those who would have butcher'd me? 

Omnes, Liv. and Ant. excepted . 
Ha, ha, ha! 
(laughing some time.) 


Bar. 
No where, Valdemere, but in your own imagination. We have put this deceit upon you to cure you of arrogance and boasting. 


Walt. 
Running the usual risk, gentle Count, of not having our services very thankfully acknowledged. 


Vald. 
You have laid a diabolical snare for me, and I have fallen into it most wretchedly.---I have been strangely overcome. I have been moved as with magic.---I have been---I ---I know not---What shall I call it? 


Walt. 
Give yourself no trouble about that, Count; we can find a name for it. 


Ant. 
Nay, good Sir; you shall not call it by any name a man would be asham--- 
(correcting 

[Page 257 ] 

himself) 
[150]  unwilling to hear. The Count, as Dartz has informed me, while I bound up his wound above stairs, has been tampered with, by dreams and fortune-telling and other devices, in a way that might have overcome many a man, who, differently circumstanced, would not have shrunk from his duty in the field. And shall we sport wantonly with a weakness of our nature in some degree common to all? We admire a brave man for overcoming it, and should pity the less brave when it overcomes him. 



Liv. (catching his hand eagerly) 
Noble Antonio! 


Ant. 
Young man, I thank you: this squeeze of the hand tells me I have you upon my side. 


Vald. 
And let me also say, "Noble Antonio!" ---And what more can I say! I have not deserved this generous treatment from you. 


Ant. 
Say nothing more: the transactions of this night shall be as if they had never been: they will never be mentioned by any of us. 


Walt. 
Speak for yourself, Antonio De Bertrand; my tongue is a free agent, and will not be bridled by another person's feelings. But there is one condition on which I consent to be silent as the grave; and the Baron and Chevalier [175]  concur with me. 


( Bar. and Dartz .) 
We do so. 

                                         [Exit Bar. 


Dart. 
We but require of Valdemere to do what, as a man of honour he is bound to do; and satisfied on this point, our silence is secured for ever. 


[Page 258 ] 

(Re-enter Bar. leading in Nina .) 




Bar. (to Vald. ) 
Look on this fair gentlewoman: her father was a respectable officer, though misfortunes prevented his promotion. You have taken advantage of her situation, being under the protection of the Countess your mother, as a God-daughter and distant relation, to use her most unworthily. Make her your wife, and receive, as her dowry, your reputation in the world untarnished. 


Walt. 
Now, good, heroic, sentimental Antonio; is this too much to require of the noble personage you plead for? 


Ant. 
On this I am compelled to be silent. 


Bar. 
Will Count Valdemere vouchsafe us an answer? Will you marry her or not, Count? 


Vald. 
I have indeed---I ought in strict justice ---She will not accept of one who has used her so unworthily. 



Page. (eagerly) 
I hope not: I would rather [200]  than a thousand crowns she would refuse him. 


Dart. 
Will you have him or not, pretty Nina? Don't be afraid to refuse him: we shan't think the worse of you if you do. 
( Nina stands silent and weeping.) 



Page. (aside to Nina ) 
Don't have him, Woman; he's a coward and a coxcomb, and a--- don't have him. 



Nina. (aside) 
Ah, you have never loved him as I have done, Brother. 


[Page 259 ] 




Page. (aloud) 
Murrain take thee and thy love too! thou hast no more spirit in thee than a worm. 


Bar. 
Bravo, Boy! thou hast enough of it, I see; and I'll put a stand of colours in thy hand as soon as thou art strong enough to carry them. Thou art my boy now; I will protect thee. 


Page. 
I thank you, Baron.---And my sister; will you protect her too? 


Bar. 
Yes, Child; both of you. 


Page. 
Refuse him then, Nina: hast thou no more pride about thee? 


Nina. 
Alas! I should have more pride: I know I should; but I have been sadly humbled. 


Page. 
Thou'lt be still more so if thou art his wife, trust me! for he'll despise thee, and cow thee, and make thee a poor slave to his will. [225]  Thou'lt tremble at every glance of his eye, and every turn of his humoursome fancy.---He'll treat thee like a very--- 


Vald. 
Stop, spiteful Wretch! I'll cherish and protect her, and turn every word thou hast uttered to a manifest and abominable falsehood. ---Give me thy hand, Nina; thou really lovest me; no one will do it but thee; and I shall have need of somebody to love me. 


Omnes. 
Well said, Count! this is done like a man! 



Ant. (to Page ) 
Faith, Boy! those sharp words of thine were worth a store of gentle persuasion. Thou hast woo'd for thy sister in a spell-like fashion as witches say their prayers backwards. I wish somebody would court my mistress for 

[Page 260 ] 

me in the same manner: 'tis the only chance have of winning her. 



Liv. (in a feigned voice) 
I'll do that for thee, gallant De Bertrand; for I know faults enough of yours to acquaint her with, besides the greatest of all faults, concealing good talents under a bushel; every tittle of which I will tell her forthwith, and she'll marry you, no doubt, out of spite. 


Ant. 
[250]  Thanks, pleasant Stripling! May thy success be equal to thy zeal! 
(Taking her hand) 
Thy name, Youth: thou hast a pretty gait in that warlike cloak of thine, but thy cap overshadows thee perversely.---Ha! this is not a boy's hand!---That ring---O Heavens! 

                                         (Retires some paces back in confusion, while Livia , taking off her cap and cloak, makes him a profound curtesey; and pauses, expecting him to speak. Finding him silent, she begins to rub her hand, and look at it affectedly.) 


Liv. 
It is not a boy's hand, Baron de Bertrand: 'tis the hand of a weak foolish woman, which shall be given to a lover of hers who is not much wiser than herself, whenever he has courage to ask it. 



Walt. (aside, jogging Ant. ) 
That is thyself: dost thou not apprehend her, Man? 



Liv. (still looking at her hand) 
Even so; whenever he has courage to ask it. That, I suppose, may happen in about five or six years from this present time. 


[Page 261 ] 




Ant. (running up to her, catching her hand, and putting his knee to the ground) 
Now, now, dear Livia! O that I could utter what I feel! ---I am a fool still;---I cannot. 


Liv. 
Nothing you can possibly say will make me more sensible of your generous worth, or more ashamed of my former injustice to it. 

                                         (All crowd round Ant. and Liv. to congratulate them, when the Countess is heard speaking angrily without.) 


Dart. 
We must pay our compliments another time; I fear there is a storm ready to burst [275]  upon us. 

Enter Countess . 



Countess. 
Yes, Gentlemen; I have heard of your plot, as you call it; a diabolical conspiracy for debasing the merit you envy. I despise you all: you are beneath my anger. 


Walt. 
Let us escape it then. 



Countess. (to Walt. ) 
Aye, snarling Cynic! who hast always a prick of thy adder's tongue to bestow upon every one whom the world admires or caresses; thou art the wicked mover of all these contrivances. 
(To the Bar. ) 
As for you, poor antiquated Rhime-maker ! had I but continued to praise your verses, you would have suffered me to ruin your whole kindred very quietly; nor had one single grain of compunction disturbed the sweet calm of your gratified vanity. 


Bar. 
Nay, Madam; I cannot charge my memory with any interruption of your goodness, 

[Page 262 ] 

in this respect, to my face: had you been as perseveringly obliging behind my back, we might indeed have remained longer friends than would have been entirely for the interests of my heir. 


Countess. 
Well, well; may every urchin of the principality learn by rote some scrap of your [300]  poetry, and mouth it at you as often as you stir abroad! 
(To Liv. ) 
And you, Madam; you are here, too, amongst this worshipful divan! This is your hospitality---your delicacy---your--- O! may you wed a tyrant for your pains, and these walls prove your odious prison!---But I spend my words vainly: where is the unhappy victim of your envious malevolence? They told me he was here. 
(Discovering Vald. and Nina retired to the bottom of the stage) 
Ha! you are here, patiently enduring their triumph, degenerate Boy! Is this the fruit of all my cares? Did I procure for you a military appointment, did I tease every creature connected with me for your promotion, did I ruin myself for your extravagant martial equipments---and has it all come to this? 


Vald. 
You put me into the army, Madam, to please your own vanity; and they who thrust their sons into it for that purpose, are not always gratified. 


Countess. 
And you answer me thus! I have spoilt you, indeed; and an indulged child, I find, does not always prove a dutiful one. Who is that you hold by the hand? 


[Page 263 ] 



Vald. 
[325]  My wife, Madam. 


Countess. 
Your wife! You do not say so: you dare not say so. Have they imposed a wife upon you also? Let go her unworthy hand. 


Vald. 
No, Madam; never. It is my hand that is unworthy to hold so much innocent affection. 


Countess. 
You are distracted: let go her hand, or I renounce you for ever.---What, will you not? 


Vald. 
I will not. 


Countess. 
Thou can'st be sturdy, I find, only for thine own ruin. They have confounded and bewildered thee: thou hast joined the conspiracy against thyself, and thy poor mother.--- O, I could hate thee more than them all!--- Heaven grant me patience! 


Walt. 
I like to hear people pray for what they really want. 


Countess. 
Insolent! Heaven grant you what you need not pray for, the detestation of every one annoyed with your pestiferous society. 

                                         [ Exit in rage. 


Dart. 
Let us be thankful this tornado is over, and the hurry of an eventful day and night so happily concluded.---I hope, charming Livia, [350]  you forgive our deceit, and regret not its consequences. 


Liv. 
The only thing to be regretted, Chevalier, is the wound you have received. 


Dart. 
Thank God! this, though but slight, is the only harm that has been done to-night, 

[Page 264 ] 

a broken pate or two excepted; and our feigned attack upon the castle has been providentially the means of defending it from a real one. Had not Antonio, however, who was not in our plot, come so opportunely to our aid, we had been beaten.---But now that I have time to enquire, how did'st thou come so opportunely? 


Ant. 
I have been in the habit of wandering after dark round the walls. Livia knows not how many nights I have watched the light gleaming from the window of her chamber. Wandering then, as usual, I discovered a corps of the enemy on their march to the castle, and went immediately for succour, which I fortunately found. We have both fought stoutly, my Friend, with our little force; but the blows have fallen to your share, and the blessing to mine. 


Dart. 
Not so; friends keep not their shares so distinctly. 


Liv. 
[375]  True, Chevalier; and you claim, besides, whatever satisfaction you may have from the gratitude of this good company, for contriving a plot that has ended so fortunately. 


Dart. 
Nay, there is, I fear, one person in this good company, from whom my claims, of this kind, are but small.---Count Valdemere, can you forgive me? 


Vald. 
Ask me not at present, Dartz. I know that my conduct to Antonio did deserve correction; but you have taken a revenge for him with merciless severity, which he would 

[Page 265 ] 

himself have been too generous, too noble to have taken. 


Dart. 
Well, Count, I confess I stand somewhat reproved and conscience-stricken before you. 



Walt. (to Dart. ) 
Why, truly, if he forgive thee, or any of us, by this day twelve-month, it will be as much as we can reasonably expect. 


Dart. 
Be it so! And now we have all pardon to ask, where, I hope, it will be granted immediately. 
(Bowing to the audience.) 

Back matter 

THE END.
