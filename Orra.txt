ACT I. SCENE I.
An open space before the walls of a castle, with wild mountains beyond it; enter Glottenbal , armed as from the lists, but bare-headed and in disorder, and his arms soiled with earth or sand, which an Attendant is now and then brushing off, whilst another follows bearing his helmet; with him enters Maurice , followed by Rudigere , who is also armed, and keeps by himself, pacing to and fro at the bottom of the stage, whilst the others come forward.
Glot.

( speaking as he enters, loud and boastingly ).
1   Ay, let him triumph in his paltry
2   honours,


[Page 236]
3   Won by mere trick and accident. Good faith!
4   It were a shame to call it strength or skill,
5   Were it not, Rudigere?


[ Calling to Rudigere , who answers not.
Maur.
6   His brow is dark, his tongue is lock'd, my lord;
7   There come no words from him; he bears it not
8   So manfully as thou dost, noble Glottenbal.

Glot.
9   Fy on't! I mind it not.

Maur.
10   And wherefore shouldst thou? This same Theobald,
11   Count and co-burgher—mixture most unseemly
12   Of base and noble,—know we not right well
13   What powers assist him? Mark'd you not, my lord,
14   How he did turn him to the witchy north,
15   When first he mounted; making his fierce steed,
16   That paw'd and rear'd and shook its harness'd neck
17   In generous pride, bend meekly to the earth
18   Its maned crest, like one who made obeisance?

Glot.
19   Ha! didst thou really see it?

Maur.
19                                            Yes, brave Glottenbal,
20   I did right truly; and besides myself,
21   Many observ'd it.

Glot.
21                                            Then 'tis manifest
22   How all this foil hath been. Who e'er before
23   Saw one with such advantage of the field,
24   Lose it so shamefully? By my good fay!
25   Barring foul play and other dev'lish turns,
26   I'd keep my courser's back with any lord,
27   Or knight, or squire, that e'er bestrode a steed.
28   Thinkst thou not, honest Maurice, that I could?

Maur.
29   Who doubts it, good my lord? This Falkenstein
30   Is but a clown to you.

Glot.
30                                            Well let him boast.
31   Boasting I scorn; but I will shortly show him
32   What these good arms, with no foul play against them,
33   Can honestly achieve.

Maur.
34   Yes, good my lord; but choose you well your day:
35   A moonless Friday luck did never bring
36   To honest combatant.

Glot.
37   Ha! blessing on thee! I ne'er thought of this:
38   Now it is clear how our mischance befell.
39   Be sure thou tell to every one thou meetst,
40   Friday and a dark moon suit Theobald.
41   Ho there! Sir Rudigere! hearst thou not this?

Rud.

( as he goes off, aside to Maur .)
42   Flatter the fool awhile and let me go,
43   I cannot join thee now.


[ Exit.
Glot.

( looking after Rud .)
44   Is he so crestfallen?

Maur.
45   He lacks your noble spirit.

Glot.
45                                            Fye upon't!
46   I heed it not. Yet, by my sword and spurs!
47   'Twas a foul turn, that for my rival earn'd
48   A branch of victory from Orra's hand.

Maur.
49   Ay, foul indeed! My blood boil'd high to see it.
50   Look where he proudly comes.


Enter Theobald armed, with attendants, having a green sprig stuck in his helmet.
Glot.

( going up to Theobald ).
51   Comest thou to face me so? Audacious burgher!
52   The Lady Orra's favour suits thee not,
53   Though for a time thou hast upon me gain'd
54   A seeming 'vantage.

Theo.
55   A seeming 'vantage!—Then it is not true,
56   That thou, unhors'd, layst rolling in the dust,
57   Asking for quarter?—Let me crave thy pardon;
58   Some strange delusion hung upon our sight
59   That we believed it so.

Glot.
59                                            Off with thy taunts!
60   And pull that sprig from its audacious perch:
61   The favour of a dame too high for thee.

Theo.
62   Too high indeed; and hadst thou also added,
63   Too good, too fair, I had assented to it.
64   Yet, be it known unto your courteous worth,
65   That were this spring a queen's gift, or receiv'd
66   From the brown hand of some poor mountain maid;
67   Yea, or bestow'd upon my rambling head,
68   As in the hairy sides of browsing kid
69   The wild rose sticks a spray, unpriz'd, unbidden,
70   I would not give it thee.

Glot.
71   Dost thou so face me out? Then I will have it.


[ Snatching at it with rage.

Enter Hartman .
Hart.

( separating them ).
72   What! Malice! after fighting in the lists
73   As noble courteous knights!

Glot.

( to Hartman ).
74   Go, paltry banneret! Such friends as thou
75   Become such lords as he, whose ruin'd state
76   Seeks the base fellowship of restless burghers;
77   Thinking to humble still, with envious spite,
78   The great and noble houses of the land.
79   I know ye well, and I defy you both,
80   With all your damned witchery to boot.


[ Exit grumbling, followed by Maurice , &c. Manent Theopald and Hartman .
Theo.
81   How fierce the creature is, and full of folly!
82   Like a shent cur to his own door retired,
83   That bristles up his furious back, and there
84   Each passenger annoys.—And this is he,
85   Whom sordid and ambitious Hughobert,
86   The guardian in the selfish father sunk,
87   Destines for Orra's husband.—O foul shame!
88   The carrion-crow and royal eagle join'd,
89   Make not so cross a match.—But thinkst thou, Hartman,
90   She will submit to it?



[Page 237]
Hart.
91   That may be as thou pleasest, Falkenstein.

Theo.
92   Away with mockery!

Hart.
92                                            I mock thee not.

Theo.
93   Nay, banneret, thou dost, Saving this favour,
94   Which every victor in these listed combats
95   From ladies' hands receives, nor then regards
96   As more than due and stated courtesy,
97   She ne'er hath honour'd me with word or look
98   Such hope to warrant.

Hart.
98                                            Wait not thou for looks.

Theo.
99   Thou wouldst not have me to a dame like this,
100   With rich domains and titled rights encompass'd,
101   These simple limbs, girt in their soldier's gear,
102   My barren hills and ruin'd tower present,
103   And say, “Accept—these will I nobly give
104   In fair exchange for thee and all thy wealth.”
105   No, Rudolph Hartman, woo the maid thyself,
106   If thou hast courage for it.

Hart.
107   Yes, Theobald of Falkenstein, I will,
108   And win her too; but all for thy behoof.
109   And when I do present, as thou hast said,
110   Those simple limbs, girt in their soldier's gear,
111   Adding thy barren hills and ruin'd tower,
112   With some few items more of gen'rous worth,
113   And native sense and manly fortitude,
114   I'll give her in return for all that she
115   Or any maid can in such barter yield,
116   Its fair and ample worth.

Theo.
116                                            So dost thou reckon.

Hart.
117   And so will Orra. Do not shake thy head.
118   I know the maid: for still she has receiv'd me
119   As one who knew her noble father well,
120   And in the bloody field in which he died
121   Fought by his side, with kind familiarity:
122   And her stern guardian, viewing these grey hairs
123   And this rough visage with no jealous eye
124   Hath still admitted it.—I'll woo her for thee.

Theo.
125   I do in truth believe thou meanst me well.

Hart.
126   And this is all thou sayst? Cold frozen words!
127   What has bewitch'd thee, man? Is she not fair?

Theo.
128   O fair indeed as woman need be form'd
129   To please and be belov'd! Though, to speak honestly,
130   I've fairer seen; yet such a form as Orra's
131   For ever in my busy fancy dwells,
132   Whene'er I think of wiving my lone state.
133   It is not this; she has too many lures;
134   Why wilt thou urge me on to meet her scorn?
135   I am not worthy of her.

Hart.

( pushing him away with gentle anger ).
136   Go to! I praised thy modesty short-wnile,
137   And now with dull and senseless perseverance,
138   Thon wouldst o'erlay me with it. Go thy ways!
139   If through thy fault, thus shrinking from the onset,
140   She should with this untoward cub be match'd,
141   'Twill haunt thy conscience like a damning sin,
142   And may it gnaw thee shrewdly!


[ Exeunt.
SCENE II.
A small apartment in the castle. Enter Rudigere musing gloomily, and muttering to himself some time before he speaks aloud.
Rud.
1   No, no; it is to formless air dissolv'd,
2   This cherish'd hope, this vision of my brain!

[ Pacing to and fro, and then stopping and musing as before.
3   I daily stood contrasted in her sight
4   With an ungainly fool; and when she smiled,
5   Methought—But wherefore still upon this thought,
6   Which was perhaps but a delusion then,
7   Brood I with ceaseless torment? Never, never!
8   O never more on me, from Orra's eye,
9   Approving glance shall light, or gentle look!
10   This day's disgrace mars all my goodly dreams.
11   My path to greatness is at once shut up.
12   Still in the dust my grov'ling fortune lies.

[ Striking his breast in despair.
13   Tame thine aspiring spirit, luckless wretch!
14   There is no hope for thee!
15   And shall I tame it? No, by saints and devils!
16   The laws have cast me off from every claim
17   Of house and kindred, and within my veins
18   Turn'd noble blood to baseness and reproach:
19   I'll cast them off: why should they be to me
20   A bar, and no protection?

[ Pacing again to and fro, and muttering low for some time before he speaks aloud .
21   Ay; this may still within my toils enthral her;
22   This is the secret weakness of her mind
23   On which I'll clutch my hold.


Enter Cathrina behind him, laying her hand upon him.
Cath.
23                                            Ha! speakst thou to thyself?

Rud.

( starting ).
24   I did not speak.

Cath.
25   Thou didst; thy busy mind gave sound to thoughts
26   Which thou didst utter with a thick harsh voice,
27   Like one who speaks in sleep. Tell me their meaning.

Rud.
28   And dost thou so presume? Be wise; be humble.

[ After a pause.
29   Has Orra oft of late requested thee
30   To tell her stories of the restless dead;
31   Of spectres rising at the midnight watch
32   By the lone trav'ller's bed?

Cath.
33   Wherefore of late dost thou so oft inquire
34   Of what she says and does?

Rud.
35   Be wise, and answer what I ask of thee;
36   This is thy duty now.



[Page 238]
Cath.
37   Alas, alas! I know that one false step
38   Has o'er me set a stern and ruthless master.

Rud.
39   No, madam; 'tis thy grave and virtuous seeming;
40   Thy saint-like carriage, rigid and demure,
41   On which thy high repute so long has stood,
42   Endowing thee with right of censorship
43   O'er every simple maid, whose cheerful youth
44   Wears not so thick a mask, that o'er thee sets
45   This ruthless master. Hereon rests my power:
46   I might expose, and therefore I command thee.

Cath.
47   Hush, hush! approaching steps!
47                                            They'll find me here!
48   I'll do whate'er thou wilt.

Rud.
49   It is but Maurice: hie thee to thy closet,
50   Where I will shortly come to thee. Be thou
51   My faithful agent in a weighty matter,
52   On which I now am bent, and I will prove
53   Thy stay and shelter from the world's contempt.

Cath.
54   Maurice to find me here! Where shall I hide me?

Rud.
55   Nowhere, but boldly pass him as he enters.
56   I'll find some good excuse; he will be silent:
57   He is my agent also.

Cath.
57                                            Dost thou trust him?

Rud.
58   Avarice his master is, as shame is thine:
59   Therefore I trust to deal with both.—Away!


Enter Maurice , passing Cathrina as she goes out.
Maur.
60   What, doth the grave and virtuous Cathrina
61   Vouchsafe to give thee of her company?

Rud.
62   Yes, rigid saint! she has bestow'd upon me
63   Some grave advice to bear with pious meekness
64   My late discomfiture.

Maur.
64                                            Ay, and she call'd it,
65   I could be sworn! heaven's judgment on thy pride.

Rud.
66   E'en so: thou'st guess'd it.—Shall we to the ramparts
67   And meet the western breeze?


[ Exeunt.
SCENE III.
A spacious apartment. Enter Hughobert and Urston .
Hugh.

( speaking with angry gesticulation as he enters ).
1   I feed and clothe these drones, and in return
2   They cheat, deceive, abuse me; nay, belike,
3   Laugh in their sleeve the while. By their advice,
4   This cursed tournay I proclaim'd; for still
5   They puff'd me up with praises of my son—
6   His grace, his skill in arms, his horsemanship—
7   Count Falkenstein to him was but a clown—
8   And so in Orra's eyes to give him honour,
9   Full surely did I think—I'll hang them all:
10   I'll starve them in a dungeon shut from light:
11   I'll heap my boards no more with dainty fare
12   To feed false flatterers.

Urst.
12                                            That indeed were wise:
13   But art thou sure, when men shall speak the truth,
14   That thou wilt feed them for it? I but hinted
15   In gentle words to thee, that Glottenbal
16   Was praised with partial or affected zeal,
17   And thou receiv'dst it angrily.

Hugh.
18   Ay, true indeed: but thou didst speak of him
19   As one bereft of all capacity.
20   Now though, God wot! I look on his defects
21   With no blind love, and even in my ire
22   Will sometimes call him fool; yet ne'ertheless,
23   He still has parts and talents, though obscur'd
24   By some untoward failings.—Heaven be praised!
25   He wants not strength at least and well turn'd limbs,
26   Had they but taught him how to use them. Knaves!
27   They have neglected him.
Enter Glottenbal , who draws back on seeing his father.

28   Advance, young sir: art thou afraid of me,
29   That thus thou shrinkest like a skulking thief
30   To make disgrace the more apparent on thee?

Glot.
31   Yes, call it then disgrace, or what you please;
32   Had not my lance's point somewhat awry
33   Glanced on his shield—

Hugh.
33                                            E'en so; I doubt it not;
34   Thy lance's point, and every thing about thee
35   Hath glanced awry. Go, rid my house, I say,
36   Of all those feasting flatterers that deceive thee;
37   They harbour here no more: dismiss them quickly.

Glot.
38   Do it yourself, my lord; you are, I trow,
39   Angry enough to do it sharply.

Hugh.

( turning to Urston ).
39                                            Faith!
40   He gibes me fairly here; there's reason in't;
41   Fools speak not thus.
( To Glottenbal .)
Go to ! if I am angry,
42   Thou art a graceless son to tell me so.

Glot.
43   Have you not bid me still to speak the truth?

Hugh.

( to Urston ).
44   Again thou hearst he makes an apt reply.

Urst.
45   He wants not words.

Hugh.
45                                            Nor meaning neither, father.
Enter Eleanora .

46   Well, dame; where hast thou been?

El.
46                                            I came from Orra.

Hugh.
47   Hast thou been pleading in our son's excuse?
48   And how did she receive it?

El.
49   I tried to do it, but her present humour
50   Is jest and merriment. She is behind me,


[Page 239]
51   Stopping to stroke a hound, that in the corridor
52   Came to her fawningly to be caress'd.

Glot.

( listening ).
53   Ay, she is coming; light and quick her steps;
54   So sound they when her spirits are unruly:
55   But I am bold; she shall not mock me now.
Enter Orra , tripping gaily, and playing with the folds of her scarf.

56   Methinks you trip it briskly, gentle dame.

Orra.
57   Does it offend you, noble knight?

Glot.
57                                            Go to!
58   I know your meaning. Wherefore smile you so?

Orra.
59   Because, good sooth! with tired and aching sides
60   I have not power to laugh.

Glot.
61   Full well I know why thou so merry art.
62   Thou thinkst of him to whom thou gav'st that sprig
63   Of hopeful green, his rusty casque to grace,
64   While at thy feet his honour'd glave he laid.

Orra.
65   Nay, rather say, of him, who at my feet,
66   From his proud courser's back, more gallantly
67   Laid his most precious self: then stole away,
68   Through modesty, unthank'd, nor left behind
69   Of all his gear that flutter'd in the dust,
70   Or glove, or band, or fragment of torn hose,
71   For dear remembrance-sake, that in my sleeve
72   I might have placed it. O! thou wrongst me much,
73   To think my merriment a ref'rence hath
74   To any one but him.


( Laughing. )
El.
75   Nay, Orra; these wild fits of uncurb'd laughter,
76   Athwart the gloomy tenor of your mind,
77   As it has low'r'd of late, so keenly cast,
78   Unsuited seem and strange.

Orra.
79   O nothing strange, my gentle Eleanora!
80   Didst thou ne'er see the swallow's veering breast,
81   Winging the air beneath some murky cloud
82   In the sunn'd glimpses of a stormy day,
83   Shiver in silv'ry brightness:
84   Or boatman's oar, as vivid lightning flash
85   In the faint gleam, that like a spirit's path
86   Tracks the still waters of some sullen lake:
87   Or lonely tower, from its brown mass of woods,
88   Give to the parting of a wintry sun
89   One hasty glance in mockery of the night
90   Closing in darkness round it? — Gentle friend!
91   Chide not her mirth, who was sad yesterday,
92   And may be so to-morrow.

Glot.
93   And wherefore art thou sad, unless it is
94   From thine own wayward humour? Other dames,
95   Were they so courted, would be gay and happy.

Orra.
96   Wayward it needs must be, since I am sad
97   When such perfection woos me.
97                                            Pray, good Glottenbal,
98   How didst thou learn with such a wondrous grace
99   So high in air to toss thine armed heels,
100   And clutch with outspread hands the slipp'ry sand?
101   I was the more amaz'd at thy dexterity,
102   As this, of all thy many gallant feats
103   Before-hand promised, most modestly
104   Thou didst forbear to mention.

Glot.
104                                            Gibe away!
105   I care not for thy gibing. With fair lists,
106   And no black arts against me—

Hugh.

( advancing angrily from the bottom of the stage to Glottenbal ).
106                                            Hold thy peace!

( To Orra .)
107   And, madam, be at least somewhat restrain'd
108   In your unruly humour.

Orra.
109   Pardon, my lord; I knew not you were near me.
110   My humour is unruly; with your leave,
111   I will retire till I have curb'd it better.

( To Eleanora .)
112   I would not lose your company, sweet countess.

El.
113   We'll go together, then.


[ Exeunt Orra and Eleanora . Manet Hughobert ; who paces angrily about the stage, while Glottenbal stands on the front, thumping his legs with his sheathed rapier.
Hugh.
114   There is no striving with a forward girl,
115   Nor pushing on a fool. My harass'd life
116   Day after day more irksome grows. Curs'd bane!
117   I'll toil no more for this untoward match.


Enter Rudigere , stealing behind, and listening.
Rud.
118   You are disturb'd, my lord.

Hugh.
119   What, is it thou? I am disturb'd in sooth.

Rud.
120   Ay, Orra has been here; and some light words
121   Of girlish levity have mov'd you. How!
122   Toil for this match no more! What else remains,
123   If this should be abandon'd, noble Aldenberg,
124   That can be worth your toil?

Hugh.
125   I'll match the cub elsewhere.

Rud.
126   What call ye matching?

Hugh.
127   Surely for him some other virtuous maid
128   Of high descent, though not so richly dower'd,
129   May be obtain'd.

Rud.
129                                            Within your walls, perhaps,
130   Some waiting gentlewoman, who perchance
131   May be some fifty generations back
132   Descended from a king, he will himself
133   Ere long obtain, without your aid, my lord.

Hugh.
134   Thou mak'st me mad! the dolt! the senseless dolt!
135   What can I do for him? I cannot force
136   A noble maid entrusted to my care:
137   I, the sole guardian of her helpless youth!

Rud.
138   That were indeed unfit; but there are means
139   To make her yield consent.

Hugh.
140   Then by my faith, good friend, I'll call thee wizard,
141   If thou canst find them out. What means already,


[Page 240]
142   Short of compulsion, have we left untried?
143   And now the term of my authority
144   Wears to its close.

Rud.
145   I know it well; and therefore powerful means,
146   And of quick operation, must be sought.

Hugh.
147   Speak plainly to me.

Rud.
147                                            I've watch'd her long.
148   I've seen her cheek, flush'd with the rosy glow
149   Of jocund spirits, deadly pale become
150   At tale of nightly sprite or apparition,
151   Such as all hear, 'tis true, with greedy ears,
152   Saying, “Saints save us!” but forget as quickly.
153   I've marked her long; she has with all her shrewdness
154   And playful merriment, a gloomy fancy,
155   That broods within itself on fearful things.

Hugh.
156   And what doth this avail us?

Rud.
156                                            Hear me out.
157   Your ancient castle in the Suabian forest
158   Hath, as too well you know, belonging to it,
159   Or false or true, frightful reports. There hold her
160   Strictly confin'd in sombre banishment;
161   And doubt not but she will, ere long, full gladly
162   Her freedom purchase at the price you name.

Hugh.
163   On what pretence can I confine her there?
164   It were most odious.

Rud.
164                                            Can pretence be wanting?
165   Has she not favour shown to Theobald,
166   Who in your neighbourhood, with his sworn friend
167   The Banneret of Basle, suspiciously
168   Prolongs his stay? A poor and paltry count,
169   Unmect to match with her. And want ye then
170   A reason for removing her with speed
171   To some remoter quarter? Out upon it!
172   You are too scrupulous.

Hugh.
173   Thy scheme is good, but cruel.


[ Glottenbal has been drawing nearer to them, and attending to the last part of their discourse.
Glot.
174   O much I like it, dearly wicked Rudigere!
175   She then will turn her mind to other thoughts
176   Than scornful gibes at me.

Hugh.
177   I to her father swore I would protect her:
178   I must fulfil his will.

Rud.
179   And, in that will, her father did desire
180   She might be match'd with this your only son:
181   Therefore you're firmly bound all means to use
182   That may the end attain.

Hugh.
183   Walk forth with me, we'll talk of this at large.


[ Exeunt Hugh . and Rud . Manet Glottenbal , who comes forward from the bottom of the stage with the action of a knight advancing to the charge.
Glot.
184   Yes, thus it is; I have the sleight o't now;
185   And were the combat yet to come, I'd show them
186   I'm not a whit behind the bravest knight,
187   Cross luck excepted.


Enter Maurice .
Maur.
188   My lord, indulge us of your courtesy.

Glot.
189   In what, I pray?

Maur.
189                                            Did not Fernando tell you?
190   We are all met within our social bower;
191   And I have wager'd on your head, that none
192   But you alone, within the count's domains,
193   Can to the bottom drain the chased horn.
194   Come do not linger here when glory calls you.

Glot.
195   Thinkst thou that Theobald could drink so stoutly?

Maur.
196   He, paltry chief! he herds with sober burghers;
197   A goblet, half its size, would conquer him.


[ Exeunt.
ACT II. SCENE I.
A garden with trees, and shrubs, &c. Orra, Theobald , and Hartman , are discovered in a shaded walk at the bottom of the stage, speaking in dumb show, which they cross, disappearing behind the trees; and are presently followed by Cathrina and Alice , who continue walking there. Orra, Theo ., and Hart . then appear again, entering near the front of the stage.
Orra

( talking to Hart . as she enters ).
1   And so, since fate has made me, woe the day!
2   That poor and good-for-nothing, helpless being.
3   Woman yclept, I must consign myself
4   With all my lands and rights into the hands
5   Of some proud man, and say, “Take all, I pray,
6   And do me in return the grace and favour
7   To be my master.”

Hart.
8   Nay, gentle lady, you constrain my words.
9   And load them with a meaning harsh and foreign
10   To what they truly bear.—A master! No;
11   A valiant gentle mate, who in the field
12   Or in the council will maintain your right:
13   A noble, equal partner.

Orra

( shaking her head ).
13                                            Well I know,
14   In such a partnership, the share of power
15   Allotted to the wife. See, noble Falkenstein
16   Hath silent been the while, nor spoke one word
17   In aid of all your specious arguments.

( To Theo .)
18   What's your advice, my lord?

Theo.
18                                            Ah, noble Orra,
19   'Twere like self-murder to give honest counsel;
20   Then urge me not. I frankly do confess
21   I should be more heroic than I am.

Orra.
22   Right well I see thy head approves my plan,
23   And by-and-bye so will thy gen'rous heart.
24   In short, I would, without another's leave,
25   Improve the low condition of my peasants,
26   And cherish them in peace. E'en now, methinks,
27   Each little cottage of my native vale


[Page 241]
28   Swells out its earthen sides, up-heaves its roof,
29   Like to a hillock mov'd by lab'ring mole,
30   And with green trail-weeds clamb'ring up its walls,
31   Roses and ev'ry gay and fragrant plant,
32   Before my fancy stands, a fairy bower:
33   Ay, and within it too do fairies dwell.

[ Looking playfully through her fingers like a show-glass.
34   Peep through its wreathed window, if indeed
35   The flowers grow not too close, and there within
36   Thou'lt see some half a dozen rosy brats
37   Eating from wooden bowls their dainty milk;—
38   Those are my mountain elves. Seest thou not
39   Their very forms distinctly?

Theo.
40   Distinctly; and most beautiful the sight!
41   A sight which sweetly stirreth in the heart
42   Feelings that gladden and ennoble it,
43   Dancing like sun-beams on the rippled sea;
44   A blessed picture! Foul befall the man
45   Whose narrow, selfish soul would shade or mar it!

Hart.
46   To this right heartily I say Amen!
47   But if there be a man whose gen'rous soul

[ Turning to Orra .
48   Like ardour fills; who would with thee pursue
49   Thy gen'rous plan; who would his harness don—

Orra

( putting her hand on him in gentle interruption ).
50   Nay, valiant banneret, who would, an't please you,
51   His harness doff: all feuds, all strife forbear,
52   All military rivalship, all lust
53   Of added power, and live in steady quietness,
54   A mild and fost'ring lord. Know you of one
55   That would so share my task?—You answer not;
56   And your brave friend, methinks, casts on the ground
57   A thoughtful look: wots he of such a lord?


[ To Theo .
Theo.
58   Wot I of such a lord? No, noble Orra,
59   I do not; nor does Hartman, though perhaps
60   His friendship may betray his judgment. No;
61   None such exist: we are all fierce, contentious,
62   Restless and proud, and prone to vengeful feuds;
63   The very distant sound of war excites us,
64   Like the curb'd courser list'ning to the chase,
65   Who paws, and frets, and bites the rein. Trust none
66   To cross thy gentle, but most princely purpose,
67   Who hath on head a circling helmet worn,
68   Or ever grasp'd a glave.—But ne'ertheless
69   There is—I know a man.— Might I be bold?

Orra.
70   Being so honest, boldness is your right.

Theo.
71   Permitted then, I'll say, I know a man,
72   Though most unworthy Orra's lord to be,
73   Who, as her champion, friend, devoted soldier,
74   Might yet commend himself; and, so received,
75   Who would at her command, for her defence
76   His sword right proudly draw. An honour'd sword,
77   Like that which at the gate of Paradise
78   From steps profane the blessed region guarded.

Orra.
79   Thanks to the gen'rous knight! I also know
80   The man thou wouldst commend; and when my state
81   Such service needeth, to no sword but his
82   Will I that service owe.

Theo.
83   Most noble Orra! greatly is he honour'd;
84   And will not murmur that a higher wish,
85   Too high, and too presumptuous, is repress'd.


[ Kissing her hand with great respect.
Orra.
86   Nay, Rudolph Hartman, clear that cloudy brow,
87   And look on Falkenstein and on myself
88   As two co-burghers of thy native city
89   (For such I mean ere long to be), and claiming
90   From thee, as cadets from an elder born,
91   Thy cheering equal kindness.


Enter a Servant.
Serv.
92   The count is now at leisure to receive
93   The lord of Falkenstein, and Rudolph Hartman.

Hart.
94   We shall attend him shortly.
[ Exit servant.

( Aside to Theo .)

94                                            Must we now
95   Our purpos'd suit to some pretended matter
96   Of slighter import change?

Theo.

( to Hart . aside ).
96                                            Assuredly.—
97   Madam, I take my leave with all devotion.

Hart.
98   I with all friendly wishes.


[ Exeunt Theo . and Hart. Cathrina and Alice now advance through the shrubs, &c. at the bottom of the stage, while Orra remains, wrapped in thought, on the front.
Cath.
99   Madam, you're thoughtful; something occupies
100   Your busy mind.

Orra.
101   What was't we talk'd of, when the worthy banneret
102   With Falkenstein upon our converse broke?

Cath.
103   How we should spend our time, when in your castle
104   You shall maintain your state in ancient splendour,
105   With all your vassals round you.

Orra.
106   Ay, so it was.

Al.
106                                            And you did say, my lady,
107   It should not be a cold unsocial grandeur:
108   That you would keep, the while, a merry house.

Orra.
109   O doubt it not! I'll gather round my board
110   All that heav'n sends to me of way-worn folks,
111   And noble travellers, and neighb'ring friends,
112   Both young and old. Within my ample hall,
113   The worn-out man of arms (of whom too many,
114   Nobly descended, rove like reckless vagrants
115   From one proud chieftain's castle to another,
116   Half chid, half honour'd) shall o' tiptoe tread,
117   Tossing his grey locks from his wrinkled brow
118   With cheerful freedom, as he boasts his feats
119   Of days gone by.—Music we'll have; and oft
120   The bick'ring dance upon our oaken floors
121   Shall, thund'ring loud, strike on the distant ear
122   Of'nighted trav'llers, who shall gladly bend
123   Their doubtful footsteps tow'rds the cheering din.
124   Solemn, and grave, and cloister'd, and demure
125   We shall not be. Will this content ye, damsels?



[Page 242]
Al.
126   O passing well! 'twill be a pleasant life;
127   Free from all stern subjection; blithe and fanciful;
128   We'll do whate'er we list.

Cath.
129   That right and prudent is, I hope thou meanest.

Al.
130   Why ever so suspicious and so strict?
131   How couldst thou think I had another meaning?

( To Orra .)
132   And shall we ramble in the woods full oft
133   With hound and horn?—that is my dearest joy.

Orra.
134   Thou runn'st me fast, good Alice. Do not doubt
135   This shall be wanting to us. Ev'ry season
136   Shall have its suited pastime: even Winter
137   In its deep noon, when mountains piled with snow,
138   And chok'd up valleys from our mansion bar
139   All entrance, and nor guest, nor traveller
140   Sounds at our gate; the empty hall forsaking,
141   In some warm chamber, by the crackling fire
142   We'll hold our little, snug, domestic court,
143   Plying our work with song and tale between.

Cath.
144   And stories too, I ween, of ghosts and spirits,
145   And things unearthly, that on Michael's eve
146   Rise from the yawning tombs.

Orra.
147   Thou thinkest then one night o'th' year is truly
148   More horrid than the rest.

Cath.
149   Perhaps 'tis only silly superstition:
150   But yet it is well known the count's brave father
151   Would rather on a glacier's point have lain,
152   By angry tempests rock'd, than on that night
153   Sunk in a downy couch in Brunier's castle.

Orra.
154   How, pray? What fearful thing did scare him so?

Cath.
155   Hast thou ne'er heard the story of Count Hugo,
156   His ancestor, who slew the hunter-knight?

Orra

( eagerly ).
157   Tell it, I pray thee.

Al.
158   Cathrina, tell it not; it is not right:
159   Such stories ever change her cheerful spirits
160   To gloomy pensiveness; her rosy bloom
161   To the wan colour of a shrouded corse.

( To Orra .)
162   What pleasure is there, lady, when thy hand,
163   Cold as the valley's ice, with hasty grasp
164   Seizes on her who speaks, while thy shrunk form
165   Cow'ring and shiv'ring stands with keen turn'd ear
166   To catch what follows of the pausing tale?

Orra.
167   And let me cow'ring stand, and be my touch
168   The valley's ice: there is a pleasure in it.

Al.
169   Sayst thou indeed there is a pleasure in it?

Orra.
170   Yea, when the cold blood shoots through every vein:
171   When every pore upon my shrunken skin
172   A knotted knoll becomes, and to mine ears
173   Strange inward sounds awake, and to mine eyes
174   Rush stranger tears, there is a joy in fear.

[ Catching hold of Cathrina .
175   Tell it, Cathrina, for the life within me
176   Beats thick, and stirs to hear
177   He slew the hunter-knight?

Cath.
178   Since I must tell it, then, the story goes
179   That grim Count Aldenberg, the ancestor
180   Of Hughobert, and also of yourself,
181   From hatred or from envy, to his castle
182   A noble knight, who hunted in the forest,
183   Well the Black Forest named, basely decoy'd,
184   And there, within his chamber, murder'd him—

Orra.
185   Merciful Heaven! and in my veins there runs
186   A murderer's blood. Saidst thou not, murder'd him?

Cath.
187   Ay; as he lay asleep, at dead of night.

Orra.
188   A deed most horrible!

Cath.
189   It was on Michael's eve; and since that time,
190   The neighb'ring hinds oft hear the midnight yell
191   Of spectre-hounds, and see the spectre shapes
192   Of huntsmen on their sable steeds, with still
193   A noble hunter riding in their van
194   To cheer the chase, shown by the moon's pale beams,
195   When wanes its horn in long October nights.

Orra.
196   This hath been often seen?

Cath.
196                                            Ay, so they say.
197   But, as the story goes, on Michael's eve,
198   And on that night alone of all the year,
199   The hunter-knight himself, having a horn
200   Thrice sounded at the gate, the castle enters;
201   And, in the very chamber where he died,
202   Calls on his murd'rer, or in his default
203   Some true descendant of his house, to loose
204   His spirit from its torment; for his body
205   Is laid i' the earth unbless'd, and none can tell
206   The spot of its interment.

Orra.
207   Call on some true descendant of his race!
208   It were to such a fearful interview.
209   But in that chamber, on that night alone—
210   Hath he elsewhere to any of the race
211   Appeared? or hath he power—

Al.
211                                            Nay, nay, forbear:
212   See how she looks.
( To Orra .)
I fear thou art not well.

Orra.
213   There is a sickly faintness come upon me.

Al.
214   And didst thou say there is a joy in fear?

Orra.
215   My mind of late has strange impressionsg ta'en.
216   I know not how it is.

Al.
216                                            A few nights since,
217   Stealing o' tiptoe, softly through your chamber,
218   Towards my own—

Orra.
219   O heaven defend us! didst thou see aught there?

Al.
220   Only your sleeping self. But you appear'd
221   Distress'd and troubled in your dreams; and once
222   I thought to wake you ere I left the chamber,
223   But I forbore.

Orra.
223                                            And glad I am thou didst.
224   It is not dreams I fear; for still with me
225   There is an indistinctness o'er them cast,
226   Like the dull gloom of misty twilight, where
227   Before mine eyes pass all incongruous things,
228   Huge, horrible, and strange, on which I stare
229   As idiots do upon this changeful world,


[Page 243]
230   With nor surprise nor speculation. No;
231   Dreams I fear not: it is the dreadful waking,
232   When, in deep midnight stillness, the roused fancy
233   Takes up th' imperfect shadows of its sleep,
234   Like a marr'd speech snatch'd from a bungler's mouth,
235   Shaping their forms distinctively and vivid
236   To visions horrible:—this is my bane;—
237   It is the dreadful waking that I fear.

Al.
238   Well, speak of other things. There in good time
239   Your ghostly father comes with quicken'd steps,
240   Like one who bears some tidings good or ill.
241   Heaven grant they may be good!


Enter Urston .
Orra.
242   Father, you seem disturb'd.

Urst.
243   Daughter, I am in truth disturb'd. The count
244   All o' the sudden, being much enraged
245   That Falkenstein still lingers near these walls,
246   Resolves to send thee hence, to be awhile
247   In banishment detain'd, till on his son
248   Thou lookst with better favour.

Orra.
248                                            Ay, indeed!
249   That is to say perpetual banishment:
250   A sentence light or heavy, as the place
251   Is sweet or irksome he would send me to.

Urst.
252   He will contrive to make it, doubt him not,
253   Irksome enough. Therefore I would advise thee
254   To feign at least, but for a little time,
255   A disposition to obey his wishes.
256   He's stern, but not relentless; and his dame,
257   The gentle Eleanor, will still befriend you,
258   When fit occasion serves.

Orra.
258                                            What saidst thou, father?
259   To feign a disposition to obey!
260   I did mistake thy words.

Urst.
260                                            No, gentle daughter;
261   So press'd, thou mayest feign and yet be blameless.
262   A trusty guardian's faith with thee he holds not,
263   And therefore thou art free to meet his wrongs
264   With what defence thou hast.

Orra

( proudly ).
265   Nay, pardon me; I, with an unshorn crown,
266   Must hold the truth in plain simplicity,
267   And am in nice distinctions most unskilful.

Urst.
268   Lady, have I deserv'd this sharpness? oft
269   Thine infant hand has strok'd this shaven crown:
270   Thou'st ne'er till now reproach'd it.

Orra

( bursting into tears ).
271   Pardon, O pardon me, my gentle Urston!
272   Pardon a wayward child, whose eager temper
273   Doth sometimes mar the kindness of her heart.
274   Father, am I forgiven?


( Hanging on him. )
Urst.
274                                            Thou art, thou art:
275   Thou art forgiven; more than forgiven, my child.

Orra.
276   Then lead me to the count, I will myself
277   Learn his stern purpose.

Urst.
277                                            In the hall he is,
278   Seated in state, and waiting to receive you.


[ Exeunt.
SCENE III.
A spacious apartment, or baron's hall, with a chair of state. Hughobert, Eleanora , and Glottenbal enter near the front, speaking as they enter; and afterwards enter Vassals and Attendants, who range themselves at the bottom of the stage.
Hugh.
1   Cease, dame! I will not hear; thou striv'st in vain
2   With thy weak pleadings. Orra hence must go
3   Within the hour, unless she will engage
4   Her plighted word to marry Glottenbal.

Glot.
5   Ay, and a mighty hardship, by the mass!

Hugh.
6   I've summon'd her in solemn form before me,
7   That these my vassals should my act approve,
8   Knowing my right of guardianship; and also
9   That her late father, in his dying moments,
10   Did will she should be married to my son;
11   Which will, she now must promise to obey,
12   Or take the consequence.

El.
12                                            But why so hasty?

Hugh.
13   Why, sayst thou? Falkenstein still in these parts
14   Lingers with sly intent. Even now he left me,
15   After an interview of small importance,
16   Which he and Hartman, as a blind pretence
17   For seeing Orra, formally requested.
18   I say again she must forthwith obey me,
19   Or take the consequence of wayward will.

El.
20   Nay, not for Orra do I now entreat
21   So much as for thyself. Bethink thee well
22   What honour thou shalt have, when it is known
23   Thy ward from thy protecting roof was sent;
24   Thou who shouldst be to her a friend, a father.

Hugh.
25   But do I send her unprotected? No!
26   Brave Rudigere conducts her with a band
27   Of trusty spearmen. In her new abode
28   She will be safe as here.

El.
28                                            Ha! Rudigere!
29   Putst thou such trust in him? Alas, my lord!
30   His heart is full of cunning and deceit.
31   Wilt thou to him the flower of all thy race
32   Rashly intrust? O be advised, my lord!

Hugh.
33   Thy ghostly father tells thee so, I doubt not.
34   Another priest confesses Rudigere,
35   And Urston likes him not. But canst thou think,
36   With aught but honest purpose, he would chose
37   From all her women the severe Cathrina,
38   So strictly virtuous, for her companion?
39   This puts all doubt to silence. Say no more,
40   Else I shall think thou pleadst against my son,
41   More with a step-dame's than a mother's feelings.



[Page 244]
Glot.
42   Ay, marry does she, father! And forsooth!
43   Regards me as a fool. No marvel then
44   That Orra scorns me; being taught by her,—
45   How should she else?—So to consider me!

Hugh.

( to Glottenbal ).
46   Tut! hold thy tongue.

El.
47   He wrongs me much, my lord.

Hugh.
48   No more, for here she comes.


Enter Orra , attended by Urston, Alice and Cathrina , whilst Hughobert seats himself in his chair of state, the vassals, &c. ranging themselves on each side.
Hugh.

( to Orra ).
49   Madam and ward, placed under mine authority,
50   And to my charge committed by my kinsman,
51   Ulric of Aldenberg, thy noble father:
52   Having all gentle means essay'd to win thee
53   To the fulfilment of his dying will,
54   That did decree his heiress should be married
55   With Glottenbal my heir; I solemnly
56   Now call upon thee, ere that rougher means
57   Be used for this good end, to promise truly
58   Thou wilt, within a short and stated time,
59   Before the altar give thy plighted faith
60   To this my only son. I wait thine answer.
61   Orra of Aldenberg, wilt thou do this?

Orra.
62   Count of the same, my lord and guardian,
63   I will not.

Hugh.
63                                            Have a care, thou froward maid!
64   'Tis thy last opportunity: ere long
65   Thou shalt, within a dreary dwelling pent,
66   Count thy dull hours, told by the dead man's watch,
67   And wish thou hadst not been so proudly wilful.

Orra.
68   And let my dull hours by the dead man's watch
69   Be told; yea, make me too the dead man's mate,
70   My dwelling place the nailed coffin; still
71   I would prefer it to the living lord
72   Your goodness offers me.

Hugh.
72                                            Art thou bewitch'd?
73   Is he not young, well featured and well form'd?
74   And dost thou put him in thy estimation
75   With bones and sheeted clay?
76   Beyond endurance is thy stubborn spirit.
77   Right well thy father knew that all thy sex
78   Stubborn and headstrong are; therefore, in wisdom,
79   He vested me with power that might compel thee
80   To what he will'd should be.

Orra.
80                                            O not in wisdom!
81   Say rather in that weak, but gen'rous faith,
82   Which said to him, the cope of heaven would fall
83   And smother in its cradle his swath'd babe,
84   Rather than thou. his mate in arms, his kinsman,
85   Who by his side in many a field had fought,
86   Shouldst take advantage of his confidence
87   For sordid ends.—
87                                            My brave and noble father!
88   A voice comes from thy grave and cries against it,
89   And bids me to be bold. Thine awful form
90   Rises before me,—and that look of anguish
91   On thy dark brow!—O no! I blame thee not.

Hugh.
92   Thou seemst beside thyself with such wild gestures
93   And strangely-flashing eyes. Repress these fancies,
94   And to plain reason listen. Thou hast said,
95   For sordid ends I have advantage ta'en.
96   Since thy brave father's death, by war and compact,
97   Thou of thy lands hast lost a third; whilst I,
98   By happy fortune, in my heir's behalf,
99   Have doubled my domains to what they were
100   When Ulric chose him as a match for thee.

Orra.
101   O, and what speaketh this, but that my father
102   Domains regarded not; and thought a man
103   Such as the son should be of such a man
104   As thou to him appear'dst, a match more honourable
105   Than one of ampler state. Take thou from Glottenbal
106   The largely added lands of which thou boastest,
107   And put, in lieu thereof, into his stores
108   Some weight of manly sense and gen'rous worth,
109   And I will say thou keepst faith with thy friend:
110   But as it is, although a king's domains
111   Increas'd thy wealth, thou poorly wouldst deceive him.

Hugh.

( rising from his chair in anger ).
112   Now, madam, be all counsel on this matter
113   Between us closed. Prepare thee for thy journey.

El.
114   Nay, good my lord! consider.

Hugh.

( to Eleanora ).
114                                            What, again!
115   Have I not said thou hast an alien's heart
116   From me and mine. Learn to respect my will:
117   —Be silent, as becomes a youthful dame.

Urst.
118   For a few days may she not still remain?

Hugh.
119   No, priest; not for an hour. It is my pleasure
120   That she for Brunier's castle do set forth
121   Without delay.

Orra

( with a faint starting movement ).
121                        In Brunier's castle!

Hugh.
121                                            Ay;
122   And doth this change the colour of thy cheek,
123   And give thy alter'd voice a feebler sound?

[ Aside to Glottenbal .
124   She shrinks, now to her, boy; this is thy time.

Glot.

( to Orra ).
125   Unless thou wilt, thou needst not go at all.
126   There is full many a maiden would right gladly
127   Accept the terms we offer, and remain.

( A pause. )
128   Wilt thou not answer me?

Orra.
128                                            I heard thee not.—
129   I heard thy voice, but not thy words. What saidst thou?

Glot.
130   I say, there's many a maiden would right gladly
131   Accept the terms we offer, and remain.


[Page 245]
132   The daughter of a king hath match'd ere now
133   With mine inferior. We are link'd together
134   As 'twere by right and natural property.
135   And as I've said before I say again,
136   I love thee too: what more couldst thou desire?

Orra.
137   I thank thee for thy courtship, though uncouth;
138   For it confirms my purpose: and my strength
139   Grows as thou speakst, firm like the deep-bas'd rock.

( To Hughobert ).
140   Now for my journey when you will, my lord!
141   I'm ready.

Hugh.
141                                            Be it so! on thine own head
142   Rest all the blame!

[ Going from her.
142                                            Perverse past all belief!

[ Turning round to her sternly.
143   Orra of Aldenberg, wilt thou obey me?

Orra.
144   Count of that noble house, with all respect,
145   Again I say I will not.


[ Exit Hughobert in anger, followed by Glottenbal, Urston , &c. Manent anly Eleanora, Cathrina, Alice , and Orra , who keeps up with stately pride till Hughobert and all attendants are gone out, and then throwing herself into the arms of Eleanora , gives vent to her feelings.
El.
146   Sweet Orra! be not so depress'd; thou goest
147   For a short term, soon to return again;
148   The banishment is mine, who stays behind.
149   But I will beg of heaven with ceaseless prayers
150   To have thee soon restored: and, when I dare,
151   Will plead with Hughobert in thy behalf;
152   He is not always stern.

Orra.
153   Thanks, gentle friend! Thy voice to me doth ring
154   Like the last tones of kindly nature; dearly
155   In my remembrance shall they rest.—What sounds,
156   What sights, what horrid intercourse I may,
157   Ere we shall meet again, be doom'd to prove,
158   High heaven alone doth know.—If that indeed
159   We e'er shall meet again!


[ Falls on her neck and weeps.
El.
160   Nay, nay! come to my chamber. There awhile
161   Compose your spirits. Be not so depress'd.
[ Exeunt.

[ Rudigere , who has appeared, during the last part of the above scene, at the bottom of the stage, half concealed, as if upon the watch, now comes forward, speaking as he advances.

162   Hold firm her pride till fairly from these walls
163   Our journey is begun; then fortune hail!
164   Thy favours are secured.

[ Looking off the stage.
165   Ho, Maurice there!

Enter Maurice .
166   My faithful Maurice, I would speak with thee.
167   I leave thee here behind me; to thy care,
168   My int'rests I commit; be it thy charge
169   To counteract thy lady's influence,
170   Who will entreat her lord the term to shorten
171   Of Orra's absence, maiming thus my plan,
172   Which must, belike, have time to be effected.
173   Be vigilant, be artful; and be sure
174   Thy services I amply will repay.

Maur.
175   Ay, thou hast said so, and I have believ'd thee.

Rud.
176   And dost thou doubt?

Maur.
176                                            No; yet meantime, good sooth!
177   If somewhat of thy bounty I might finger,
178   'Twere well: I like to have some actual proof.
179   Didst thou not promise it?

Rud.
179                                            'Tis true I did,
180   But other pressing calls have drain'd my means.

Maur.
181   And other pressing calls my ebbing faith
182   May also drain, and change my promis'd purpose.

Rud.
183   Go to! I know thou art a greedy leech,
184   Though ne'ertheless thou lov'st me.

[ Taking a small case from his pocket, which he opens.
184                                            Seest thou here?
185   I have no coin; but look upon these jewels:
186   I took them from a knight I slew in battle.
187   When I am Orra's lord, thou shalt receive,
188   Were it ten thousand crowns, whate'er their worth
189   Shall by a skilful lapidary be
190   In honesty esteem'd.


[ Gives him the jewels.
Maur.
191   I thank thee, but methinks their lustre's dim.
192   I've seen the stones before upon thy breast
193   In gala days, but never heard thee boast
194   They were of so much value.

Rud.
195   I was too prudent: I had lost them else.
196   To no one but thyself would I entrust
197   The secret of their value.


Enter Servant.
Serv.
198   Sir Rudigere, the spearmen are without,
199   Waiting your further orders, for the journey.

Rud.

( to servant ).
200   I'll come to them anon.

[ Exit servant.
201   Before I go, I'll speak to thee again.


[ Exeunt severally.
ACT III. SCENE I
A forest with a half-ruined castle in the background, seen through the trees by moonlight. Franko and several Outlaws are discovered sitting on the ground, round a fire, with flagons, &c. by them, as if they had been drinking.
Song of several voices. 1   The chough and crow to roost are gone,
2      The owl sits on the tree,


[Page 246]
3   The hush'd wind wails with feeble moan,
4      Like infant charity.
5   The wild-fire dances on the fen,
6      The red star sheds its ray,
7   Uprouse ye, then, my merry men!
8      It is our op'ning day.

9   Both child and nurse are fast asleep,
10      And clos'd is every flower,
11   And winking tapers faintly peep
12      High from my lady's bower;
13   Bewilder'd hinds with shorten'd ken
14      Shrink on their murky way,
15   Uprouse, ye, then, my merry men!
16      It is our op'ning day.

17   Nor board nor garner own we now,
18      Nor roof nor latched door,
19   Nor kind mate, bound by holy vow
20      To bless a good man's store;
21   Noon lulls us in a gloomy den,
22      And night is grown our day,
23   Uprouse ye, then, my merry men!
24      And use it as ye may.

Franko

( to 1 st out. ).
25   How lik'st thou this, Fernando?

1 st out.
26   Well sung i' faith! but serving ill our turn,
27   Who would all trav'llers and benighted folks
28   Scare from our precincts. Such sweet harmony
29   Will rather tempt invasion.

Franko.
30   Fear not, for mingled voices, heard afar,
31   Through glade and glen and thicket, stealing on
32   To distant list'ners, seem wild-goblin-sounds;
33   At which the lonely trav'ller checks his steed,
34   Pausing with long-drawn breath and keen-turn'd ear,
35   And twilight pilferers cast down in haste
36   Their ill-got burthens, while the homeward hind
37   Turns from his path, full many a mile about,
38   Through bog and mire to grope his blund'ring way.
39   Such, to the startled ear of superstition,
40   Were seraph's song, could we like seraphs sing.


Enter 2 d outlaw, hastily.
2 d out.
41   Disperse ye diff'rent ways: we are undone.

Franko.
42   How sayst thou, shrinking poltroon? we undone!
43   Outlaw'd and ruin'd men, who live by daring!

2 d out.
44   A train of armed men, some noble dame
45   Escorting (so their scatter'd words discover'd
46   As, unperceiv'd, I hung upon their rear),
47   Are close at hand, and mean to pass the night
48   Within the castle.

Franko.
48                                            Some benighted travellers,
49   Bold from their numbers, or who ne'er have heard
50   The ghostly legend of this dreaded place.

1 out.
51   Let us keep close within our vaulted haunts;
52   The way to which is tangled and perplex'd,
53   And cannot be discover'd: with the morn
54   They will depart.

Franko.
55   Nay, by the holy mass! within those walls
56   Not for a night must trav'llers quietly rest,
57   Or few or many. Would we live securely,
58   We must uphold the terrors of the place:
59   Therefore, let us prepare our midnight rouse.
60   See, from the windows of the castle gleam

[ Lights seen from the castle.
61   Quick passing lights, as though they moved within
62   In hurried preparation; and that bell,

[ Bell heard.
63   Which from yon turret its shrill 'larum sends,
64   Betokens some unwonted stir. Come, hearts!
65   Be all prepared, before the midnight watch,
66   The fiend-like din of our infernal chace
67   Around the walls to raise.—Come; night advances.


[ Exeunt.
SCENE II.
A Gothic room in the castle, with the stage darkened. Enter Cathrina , bearing a light, followed by Orra .
Orra

( catching her by the robe and pulling her back ).
1   Advance no further: turn, I pray! This room
2   More dismal and more ghastly seems than that
3   Which we have left behind. Thy taper's light,
4   As thus aloft thou wav'st it to and fro,
5   The fretted ceiling gilds with feeble brightness;
6   While over-head its carved ribs glide past
7   Like edgy waves of a dark sea, returning
8   To an eclipsed moon its sullen sheen.

Cath.
9   To me it seems less dismal than the other.
10   See, here are chairs around the table set,
11   As if its last inhabitants had left it
12   Scarcely an hour ago.


[ Setting the light upon the table.
Orra.
13   Alas! how many hours and years have past
14   Since human forms around this table sat,
15   Or lamp or taper on its surface gleam'd!
16   Methinks I hear the sound of time long past
17   Still murm'ring o'er us in the lofty void
18   Of those dark arches, like the ling'ring voices
19   Of those who long within their graves have slept.
20   It was their gloomy home; now it is mine.
[ Sits down, resting her arm upon the table, and covering her eyes with her hand.

Enter Rudigere , beckoning Cathrina to come to him; and speaks to her in a low voice at the corner of the stage.

21   Go and prepare thy lady's chamber; why
22   Dost thou for ever closely near her keep?



[Page 247]
Cath.
23   She charged me so to do.

Rud.
23                                            I charge thee also
24   With paramount authority, to leave her:
25   I for awhile will take thy station here.
26   Thou art not mad? Thou dost not hesitate?


[ Fixing his eyes on her with a fierce threatening look, from which she shrinks. Exit Cath .
Orra.
27   This was the home of bloody lawless power.
28   The very air rests thick and heavily
29   Where murder hath been done.

( Sighing heavily. )
30   There is a strange oppression in my breast:
31   Dost thou not feel a close unwholesome vapour?

Rud.
32   No; ev'ry air to me is light and healthful,
33   That with thy sweet and heavenly breath is mix'd.

Orra

( starting up ).
34   Thou here!
( Looking round. )
Cathrina gone?

Rud.
35   Does Orra fear to be alone with one,
36   Whose weal, whose being on her favour hangs?

Orra.
37   Retire, Sir Knight. I choose to be alone.

Rud.
38   And dost thou choose it, here, in such a place,
39   Wearing so near the midnight hour?—Alas!
40   How loath'd and irksome must my presence be!

Orra.
41   Dost thou deride my weakness?

Rud.
41                                            I deride it!
42   No, noble maid! say rather that from thee
43   I have a kindred weakness caught. In battle
44   My courage never shrank, as my arm'd heel
45   And crested helm do fairly testify:
46   But now when midnight comes, I feel by sympathy,
47   With thinking upon thee, fears rise within me
48   I never knew before.

Orra

( in a softened kindlier voice ).
48                                            Ha! dost thou too
49   Such human weakness own?

Rud.
49                                            I plainly feel
50   We are all creatures, in the wakeful hour
51   Of ghastly midnight, form'd to cower together,
52   Forgetting all distinctions of thé day,
53   Beneath its awful and mysterious power.


[ Stealing closer to her as he speaks, and putting his arms round her.
Orra

( breaking from him ).
54   I pray thee hold thy parley further off:
55   Why dost thou press so near me?

Rud.
56   And art thou so offended, lovely Orra?
57   Ah! wherefore am I thus presumptuous deem'd?
58   The blood that fills thy veins enriches mine;
59   From the same stock we spring; though by that glance
60   Of thy disdainful eye, too well I see
61   My birth erroneously thou countest base.

Orra.
62   Erroneously!

Rud.
62                                            Yes, I will prove it so.
63   Longer I'll not endure a galling wrong
64   Which makes each word of tenderness that bursts
65   From a full heart, bold and presumptuous seem,
66   And severs us so far.

Orra.
66                                            No, subtile snake!
67   It is the baseness of thy selfish mind,
68   Full of all guile, and cunning, and deceit,
69   That severs us so far, and shall do ever.

Rud.
70   Thou prov'st how far my passion will endure
71   Unjust reproaches from a mouth so dear.

Orra.
72   Out on hypocrisy! who but thyself
73   Did Hughobert advise to send me hither?
74   And who the jailor's hateful office holds
75   To make my thraldom sure?

Rud.
76   Upbraid me not for this: had I refused,
77   One less thy friend had ta'en th' ungracious task.
78   And, gentle Orra! dost thou know a man,
79   Who might in ward all that his soul holds dear
80   From danger keep, yet would the charge refuse,
81   For that strict right such wardship doth condemn?
82   O! still to be with thee; to look upon thee;
83   To hear thy voice, makes even this place of horrors,—
84   Where, as 'tis said, the spectre of a chief,
85   Slain by our common grandsire, haunts the night,
86   A paradise—a place where I could live
87   In penury and gloom, and be most bless'd.
88   Ah! Orra! if there's misery in thraldom,
89   Pity a wretch who breathes but in thy favour:
90   Who till he look'd upon that beauteous face,
91   Was free and happy.—Pity me or kill me!


[ Kneeling and catching hold of her hand.
Orra.
92   Off, fiend! let snakes and vipers cling to me
93   So thou dost keep aloof.

Rud.

( rising indignantly ).
94   And is my love with so much hatred met?
95   Madam, beware lest scorn like this should change me
96   E'en to the baleful thing your fears have fancied.

Orra.
97   Dar'st thou to threaten me?

Rud.
98   He, who is mad with love and gall'd with scorn,
99   Dares any thing.—But O! forgive such words
100   From one who rather, humbled at your feet,
101   Would of that gentleness, that gen'rous pity,
102   The native inmate of each female breast,
103   Receive the grace on which his life depends.
104   There was a time when thou didst look on me
105   With other eyes.

Orra.
105                                            Thou dost amaze me much.
106   Whilst I believ'd thou wert an honest man,
107   Being no fool, and an adventurous soldier,
108   I look'd upon thee with good-will; if more
109   Thou didst discover in my looks than this,
110   Thy wisdom with thine honesty, in truth,
111   Was fairly match'd.

Rud.
112   Madam, the proud derision of that smile
113   Deceives me not. It is the lord of Falkenstein,
114   Who better skill'd than I in tournay-war,
115   Though not in th' actual field more valiant found,
116   Engrosses now your partial thoughts. And yet
117   What may he boast which, in a lover's suit,
118   I may not urge? He's brave, and so am I.


[Page 248]
119   In birth I am his equal; for my mother,
120   As I shall prove, was married to Count Albert,
121   My noble father, though for reasons tedious
122   Here to be stated, still their secret nuptials
123   Were unacknowledg'd, and on me hath fallen
124   A cruel stigma which degrades my fortunes.
125   But were I—O forgive th' aspiring thought!—
126   But were I Orra's lord, I should break forth
127   Like the unclouded sun, by all acknowledg'd
128   As ranking with the highest in the land.

Orra.
129   Do what thou wilt when thou art Orra's lord;
130   But being as thou art, retire and leave me:
131   I choose to be alone.


( Very proudly. )
Rud.
131                                            Then be it so.
132   Thy pleasure, mighty dame, I will not balk.
133   This night, to-morrow's night, and every night,
134   Shalt thou in solitude be left; if absence
135   Of human beings can secure it for thee.

[ Pauses and looks on her, while she seems struck and disturbed.
136   It wears already on the midnight hour;
137   Good night!

[ Pauses again, she still more disturbed.
138   Perhaps I understood too hastily
139   Commands you may retract.

Orra

( recovering her state ).
140   Leave me, I say; that part of my commands
141   I never can retract.

Rud.
141                                            You are obey'd.


[ Exit.
Orra

( paces up and down hastily for some time, then stops short, and after remaining a little while in a thoughtful posture ).
142   Can spirit from the tomb, or fiend from hell,
143   More hateful, more malignant be than man—
144   Than villanous man? Although to look on such,
145   Yea, even the very thought of looking on them,
146   Makes natural blood to curdle in the veins,
147   And loosen'd limbs to shake,
148   There are who have endur'd the visitation
149   Of supernatural beings.—O forefend it!
150   I would close couch me to my deadliest foe
151   Rather than for a moment bear alone
152   The horrors of the sight.
153   Who's there? who's there?

[ Looking round.
154   Heard I not voices near? That door ajar
155   Sends forth a cheerful light. Perhaps my women,
156   Who now prepare my chamber. Grant it be!


[ Exit, running hastily to a door from which a light is seen.
SCENE III.
A chamber, with a small bed or couch in it. Enter Rudigere and Cathrina , wrangling together.
Rud.
1   I say begone, and occupy the chamber
2   I have appointed for thee: here I'm fix'd,
3   And here I pass the night.

Cath.
3                                            Thou saidst my chamber
4   Should be adjoining that which Orra holds?
5   I know thy wicked thoughts: they meditate
6   Some dev'lish scheme; but think not I'll abet it.

Rud.
7   Thou wilt not!—angry, restive, simple fool!
8   Dost thou stop short and say, “I'll go no further?”
9   Thou, whom concealed shame hath bound so fast,—
10   My tool,—my instrument?—Fulfil thy charge
11   To the full bent of thy commission, else
12   Thee, and thy bantling too, I'll from me cast
13   To want and infamy.

Cath.
13                                            O, shameless man!
14   Thou art the son of a degraded mother
15   As low as I am, yet thou hast no pity.

Rud.
16   Ay, and dost thou reproach my bastardy
17   To make more base the man who conquer'd thee,
18   With all thy virtue, rigid and demure?
19   Who would have thought less than a sovereign prince
20   Could e'er have compass'd such achievement? Mean
21   As he may be, thou'st given thyself a master,
22   And must obey him.—Dost thou yet resist?
23   Thou know'st my meaning.


[ Tearing open his vest in vehemence of action.
Cath.
24   Under thy vest a dagger!—Ah! too well,
25   I know thy meaning, cruel, ruthless man!

Rud.
26   Have I discovered it?—I thought not of it:
27   The vehemence of gesture hath betray'd me.
28   I keep it not for thee, but for myself;
29   A refuge from disgrace. Here is another:
30   He who with high, but dangerous fortune grapples,
31   Should he be foil'd, looks but to friends like these.

[ Pulling out two daggers from his vest.
32   This steel is strong to give a vig'rous thrust;
33   The other on its venom'd point hath that
34   Which, in the feeblest hand, gives death as certain,
35   As though a giant smote the destin'd prey.

Cath.
36   Thou desp'rate man! so arm'd against thyself!

Rud.
37   Ay; and against myself with such resolves,
38   Consider well how I shall deal with those
39   Who may withstand my will or mar my purpose.
40   Thinkst thou I'll feebly—

Cath.
40                                            O be pacified.
41   I will begone: I am a humbled wretch
42   On whom thou tramplest with a tyrant's cruelty.


[ Exit.
Rud.

( looks after her with a malignant laugh, and then goes to the door of an adjoining chamber, to the lock of which he applies his ear ).
43   All still within—I'm tired and heavy grown:
44   I'll lay me down to rest. She is secure:
45   No one can pass me here to gain her chamber.
46   If she hold parley now with any thing,
47   It must in truth be ghost or sprite.—Heigh ho!
48   I'm tir'd, and will to bed.


[ Lays himself on the couch and falls asleep.

[Page 249]
The cry of hounds is then heard without at a distance, with the sound of a horn; and presently Orra enters, bursting from the door of the adjoining chamber, in great alarm.
Orra.
49   Cathrina! sleepest thou? Awake! awake!

[ Running up to the couch and starting back on seeing Rudigere .
49                                            That hateful viper here!
50   Is this my nightly guard? Detested wretch!
51   I will steal back again.

[ Walks softly on tiptoe to the door of her chamber, when the cry of hounds, &c. is again heard without, nearer than before.
51                                            O no! I dare not.
52   Though sleeping, and most hateful when awake,
53   Still he is natural life and may be rous'd.

[ Listening again.
54   'Tis nearer now: that dismal thrilling blast!
55   I must awake him.

[ Approaching the couch and shrinking back again.
55                                            O no! no, no!
56   Upon his face he wears a horrid smile
57   That speaks bad thoughts.

[ Rud . speaks in his sleep.
57                                            He mutters too my name.—
58   I dare not do it.

[ Listening again.
59   The dreadful sound is now upon the wind,
60   Sullen and low, as if it wound its way
61   Into the cavern'd earth that swallow'd it.
62   I will abide in patient silence here;
63   Though hateful and asleep, I feel me still
64   Near something of my kind.

[ Crosses her arms, and leans in a cowering posture over the back of a chair at a distance from the couch; when presently the horn is heard without, louder than before, and she starts up.
65   O it returns! as though the yawning earth
66   Had given it up again, near to the walls.
67   The horribly mingled din! 'tis nearer still:
68   'Tis close at hand: 'tis at the very gate!

[ Running up to the couch.
69   Were he a murd'rer, clenching in his hands
70   The bloody knife, I must awake him.—No!
71   That face of dark and subtle wickedness!
72   I dare not do it.
( Listening again. )
Ay; 'tis at the gate—
73   Within the gate.—
73                                            What rushing blast is that
74   Shaking the doors? Some awful visitation
75   Dread entrance makes! O mighty God of Heav'n!
76   A sound ascends the stairs.
76                                            Ho, Rudigere!
77   Awake, awake! Ho! wake thee, Rudigere!

Rud.

( waking ).
78   What cry is that so terribly strong? — Ha! Orra!
79   What is the matter?

Orra.
80   It is within the walls. Didst thou not hear it?

Rud.
81   What? The loud voice that called me?

Orra.
82   No, it was mine.

Rud.
82                                            It sounded in my ears
83   With more than human strength.

Orra.
83                                            Did it so sound?
84   There is around us, in this midnight air,
85   A power surpassing nature. List, I pray:
86   Although more distant now, dost thou not hear
87   The yell of hounds; the spectre-huntsman's horn?

Rud.
88   I hear, indeed, a strangely mingled sound:
89   The wind is howling round the battlements.
90   But rest secure where safety is, sweet Orra!
91   Within these arms, nor man nor fiend shall harm thee.


[ Approaching her with a softened winning voice, while she pushes him off with abhorrence.
Orra.
92   Vile reptile! touch me not.

Rud.
93   Ah! Orra! thou art warp'd by prejudice,
94   And taught to think me base; but in my veins
95   Lives noble blood, which I will justify.

Orra.
96   But in thy heart, false traitor! what lives there?

Rud.
97   Alas! thy angel-faultlessness conceives not
98   The strong temptations of a soul impassion'd
99   Beyond control of reason.—At thy feet—

[ Kneeling.
100   O spurn me not!


Enter several Servants, alarmed.
Rud.
101   What, all these fools upon us! Staring knaves,
102   What brings ye here at this untimely hour?

1 st serv.
103   We have all heard it—'twas the yell of hounds
104   And clatt'ring steeds, and the shrill horn between.

Rud.
105   Out on such folly!

2 d serv .
106   In very truth it pass'd close to the walls;
107   Did not your honour hear it?

Rud.
108   Ha! sayst thou so? thou art not wont to join
109   In idle tales.—I'll to the battlements
110   And watch it there: it may return again.


[ Exeunt severally , Rudigere followed by servants, and Orra into her own chamber.
SCENE IV.
The Outlaws' cave. Enter Theobald .
Theo.

( looking round ).
1   Here is a place in which some traces are
2   Of late inhabitants. In yonder nook
3   The embers faintly gleam, and on the walls
4   Hang spears and ancient arms: I must be right
5   A figure through the gloom moves towards me.
6   Ho! there! Whoe'er you are: Holla! good friend!


Enter an Outlaw.
Out.
7   A stranger! Who art thou, who art thus bold,
8   To hail us here unbidden?



[Page 250]
Theo.
9   That thou shalt shortly know. Thou art, I guess,
10   One of the outlaw'd band who haunt this forest.

Out.
11   Be thy conjecture right or wrong, no more
12   Shalt thou return to tell where thou hast found us.
13   Now for thy life!


[ Drawing his sword.
Theo.
13                                            Hear me, I do entreat thee.

Out.
14   Nay, nay! no foolish pleadings; for thy life
15   Is forfeit now; have at thee!


[ Falls fiercely upon Theobald , Who also draws and defends himself bravely, when another outlaw enters and falls likewise upon him. Theo . then recedes fighting, till he gets his back to the wall of the cavern, and there defends himself stoutly.

Enter Franko .
Franko.
16   Desist, I charge you! Fighting with a stranger,
17   Two swords to one—a solitary stranger!

1 st out.
18   We are discover'd; had he master'd me,
19   He had return'd to tell his mates above
20   What neighbours in these nether caves they have.
21   Let us despatch him.

Franko.
21                                            No, thou hateful butcher!
22   Despatch a man alone and in our power!
23   Who art thou, stranger, who dost use thy sword
24   With no mean skill; and in this perilous case
25   So bold an air and countenance maintainest?
26   What brought thee hither?

Theo.
27   My name is Theobald of Falkenstein;
28   To find the valiant captain of these bands,
29   And crave assistance of his gen'rous arm:
30   This is my business here.

Franko

( struck and agitated, to his men ).
31   Go, join your comrades in the further cave.

[ Exeunt outlaws.
32   And thou art Falkenstein? In truth thou art.
33   And who thinkst thou am I?

Theo.
34   Franko, the gen'rous leader of those outlaws.

Franko.
35   So am I call'd, and by that name alone
36   They know me. Sporting on the mountain's side,
37   Where Garva's wood waves green, in other days,
38   Some fifteen years ago, they call'd me Albert.

Theo.

( rushing into his arms ).
39   Albert; my playmate Albert! Woe the day!
40   What cruel fortune drove thee to this state?

Franko.
41   I'll tell thee all! but tell thou first to me
42   What is the aid thou camest here to ask.

Theo.
43   Ay, thou wert ever thus: still forward bent
44   To serve, not to be serv'd.
44                                            But wave we this.
45   Last night a lady to the castle came,
46   In thraldom by a villain kept, whom I
47   E'en with my life would rescue. Of armed force
48   At present destitute, I come to thee
49   Craving thy aid in counsel and in arms.

Franko.
50   When didst thou learn that outlaws harbour here,
51   For 'tis but lately we have held these haunts?

Theo.
52   Not till within the precincts of the forest,
53   Following the traces of that villain's course,
54   One of your band I met, and recogniz'd
55   As an old soldier, who, some few years back,
56   Had under my command right bravely serv'd.
57   Seeing himself discover'd, and encouraged
58   By what I told him of my story, freely
59   He offer'd to conduct me to his captain.
60   But in a tangled path some space before me,
61   Alarm'd at sight of spearmen through the brake,
62   He started from his way, and so I miss'd him,
63   Making my way alone to gain your cave.

Franko.
64   Thou'rt welcome here: and gladly I'll assist thee,
65   Though not by arms, the force within the castle
66   So far out-numbering mine.
67   But other means may serve thy purpose better.

Theo.
68   What other means, I pray?

Franko.
69   From these low caves, a passage under ground
70   Leads to the castle—to the very tower
71   Where, as I guess, the lady is confin'd.
72   When sleep has still'd the house, we'll make our way.

Theo.
73   Ay, by my faith it is a noble plan!
74   Guarded or not, we well may overcome
75   The few that may compose her midnight guard.

Franko.
76   We shall not shrink from that.—But by my fay!
77   To-morrow is St. Michael's eve: 'twere well
78   To be the spectre-huntsman for a night,
79   And bear her off, without pursuit or hindrance.

Theo.
80   I comprehend thee not.

Franko.
80                                            Thou shalt ere long.
81   But stand not here; an inner room I have,
82   Where thou shalt rest and some refreshment take,
83   And then we will more fully talk of this,
84   Which, slightly mention'd, seems chimerical.
85   Follow me.

[ Turning to him as they go out.
85                                            Hast thou still upon thine arm
86   That mark which from mine arrow thou receiv'dst
87   When sportively we shot? The wound was deep,
88   And gall'd thee much, but thou mad'st light of it.

Theo.
89   Yes, here it is.


[ Pulling up his sleeve as they go out, and Exeunt.
ACT IV. SCENE I.
The ramparts of the castle. Enter Orra and Cathrina .
Cath.

( after a pause, in which Orra walks once or twice across the stage, thoughtfully ).
1   Go in, I pray; thou wand'rest here too long.

[ A pause again.


[Page 251]
2   The air is cold; behind those further mountains
3   The sun is set. I pray thee now go in.

Orra.
4   Ha! sets the sun already? Is the day
5   Indeed drawn to its close?

Cath.
5                                            Yes, night approaches.
6   See, many a gather'd flock of cawing rooks
7   Are to their nests returning.

Orra

( solemnly ).
7                                            Night approaches!—
8   This awful night which living beings shrink from;
9   All now of every kind scour to their haunts,
10   While darkness, peopled with its hosts unknown,
11   Awful dominion holds. Mysterious night!
12   What things unutterable thy dark hours
13   May lap!—What from thy teeming darkness burst
14   Of horrid visitations, ere that sun
15   Again shall rise on the enlighten'd earth!


[ A pause.
Cath.
16   Why dost thou gaze intently on the sky?
17   Seest thou aught wonderful?

Orra.
18   Look there, behold that strange gigantic form
19   Which yon grim cloud assumes; rearing aloft
20   The semblance of a warrior's plumed head,
21   While from its half-shaped arm a streamy dart
22   Shoots angrily! Behind him too, far stretch'd,
23   Seems there not, verily, a serried line
24   Of fainter misty forms?

Cath.
24                                            I see, indeed,
25   A vasty cloud, of many clouds composed,
26   Towering above the rest; and that behind
27   In misty faintness seen, which hath some likeness
28   To a long line of rocks with pine-wood crown'd:
29   Or, if indeed the fancy so incline,
30   A file of spearmen, seen through drifted smoke.

Orra.
31   Nay, look how perfect now the form becomes:
32   Dost thou not see?—Ay, and more perfect still.
33   O thou gigantic lord, whose robed limbs
34   Beneath their stride span half the heavens! art thou
35   Of lifeless vapour formed? Art thou not rather
36   Some air-clad spirit—some portentous thing—
37   Some mission'd being—Such a sky as this
38   Ne'er usher'd in a night of nature's rest.

Cath.
39   Nay, many such I've seen; regard it not.
40   That form, already changing, will ere long
41   Dissolve to nothing. Tarry here no longer.
42   Go in, I pray.

Orra.
42                                            No; while one gleam remains
43   Of the sun's blessed light, I will not go.

Cath.
44   Then let me fetch a cloak to keep thee warm,
45   For chilly blows the breeze.

Orra.
45                                            Do as thou wilt.


[ Exit Cath .

Enter an Outlaw, stealing softly behind her.
Out.

( in a low voice ).
46   Lady!—the Lady Orra!

Orra

( starting ).
46                                            Heaven protect me!
47   Sounds it beneath my feet, in earth or air?

[ He comes forward.
48   Welcome is aught that wears a human face.
49   Didst thou not hear a sound?

Out.
49                                            What sound, an't please you?

Orra.
50   A voice which call'd me now: it spoke, methought,
51   In a low, hollow tone, suppress'd and low,
52   Unlike a human voice.

Out.
52                                            It was my own.

Orra.
53   What wouldst thou have?

Out.
53                                            Here is a letter, lady.

Orra.
54   Who sent thee hither?

Out.
55   It will tell thee all.

[ Gives a letter.
56   I must begone, your chieftain is at hand.


[ Exit.
Orra.
57   Comes it from Falkenstein? It is his seal.
58   I may not read it here. I'll to my chamber.


[ Exit hastily, not perceiving Rudigere , who enters by the opposite side, before she has time to go off.
Rud.
59   A letter in her hand, and in such haste!
60   Some secret agent here from Falkenstein?
61   It must be so.


[ Hastening after her, Exit.
SCENE II.
The Outlaws cave. Enter Theobald and Franko by opposite sides.
Theo.
1   How now, good captain; draws it near the time?
2   Are those the keys?

Franko.
2                                            They are: this doth unlock
3   The entrance to the staircase, known alone
4   To Gomez, ancient keeper of the castle,
5   Who is my friend in secret, and deters
6   The neighb'ring peasantry with dreadful tales
7   From visiting by night our wide domains.
8   The other doth unlock a secret door,
9   That leads us to the chamber where she sleeps.

Theo.
10   Thanks, gen'rous friend! thou art my better genius.
11   Didst thou not say, until the midnight horn
12   Hath sounded thrice, we must remain conceal'd?

Franko.
13   Even so. And now I hear my men without
14   Telling the second watch.

Theo.
14                                            How looks the night?

Franko.
15   As we could wish: the stars do faintly twinkle
16   Through sever'd clouds, and shed but light sufficient
17   To show each nearer object closing on you
18   In dim unshapely blackness. Aught that moves
19   Across your path, or sheep or straggling goat,
20   Is now a pawing steed or grizzly bull,
21   Large and terrific; every air-mov'd bush
22   Or jutting crag, some strange gigantic thing.

Theo.
23   Is all still in the castle?

Franko.
24   There is an owl sits hooting on the tower,


[Page 252]
25   That answer from a distant mate receives,
26   Like the faint echo of his dismal cry;
27   While a poor houseless dog by dreary fits
28   Sits howling at the gate. All else is still.

Theo.
29   Each petty circumstance is in our favour,
30   That makes the night more dismal.

Franko.
31   Ay, all goes well; as I approach'd the walls,
32   I heard two sentinels—for now, I ween,
33   The boldest spearman will not watch alone—
34   Together talk in the deep hollow voice
35   Of those who speak at midnight, under awe
36   Of the dead stillness round them.

Theo.
37   Then let us put ourselves in readiness,
38   And heaven's good favour guide us!


[ Exeunt.
SCENE III.
A gloomy apartment. Enter Orra and Rudigere .
Orra

( aside ).
1   The room is darken'd: yesternight a lamp
2   Did shed its light around on roof and walls,
3   And made the dreary space appear less dismal.

Rud.

( overhearing her, and calling to a servant without ).
4   Ho! more lights here!

[ Servant enters with a light and exit.
5   Thou art obey'd: in aught
6   But in the company of human kind,
7   Thou shalt be gratified. Thy lofty mind
8   For higher superhuman fellowship,
9   If such there be, may now prepare its strength.

Orra.
10   Thou ruthless tyrant! They who have in battle
11   Fought valiantly, shrink like a helpless child
12   From any intercourse with things unearthly.
13   Art thou a man? And bearst thou in thy breast
14   The feelings of a man? It cannot be!

Rud.
15   Yes, madam; in my breast I bear too keenly
16   The feelings of a man—a man most wretched:
17   A scorn'd, rejected man.—Make me less miserable;
18   Nay rather should I say, make me most blest;
19   And then—

Attempting to take her hand, while she steps back from him, drawing herself up with an air stately and determined, and looking steadfastly in his face.
20   I too am firm. Thou knowst my fix'd resolve:
21   Give me thy solemn promise to be mine.
22   This is the price, thou haughty, scornful maid,
23   That will redeem thee from the hour of terror!
24   This is the price—

Orra.
24                                            Which never shall be paid.


[ Walks from him to the further end of the apartment.
Rud.

( after a pause ).
25   Thou art determin'd, then.
26   Be not so rash:
27   Bethink thee well what flesh and blood can bear:
28   The hour is near at hand.

[ She, turning round, waves him with her hand to leave her.
28                                            Thou deignst no answer.
29   Well; reap the fruits of thine unconquer'd pride.


[ Exit.

Manet Orra .
Orra.
30   I am alone: that closing door divides me
31   From every being owning nature's life.—
32   And shall I be constrain'd to hold communion
33   With that which owns it not?

[ After pacing to and fro for a little while.
34   O that my mind
35   Could raise its thoughts in strong and steady fervour
36   To Him , the Lord of all existing things,
37   Who lives, and is where'er existence is;
38   Grasping its hold upon His skirted robe,
39   Beneath whose mighty rule angels and spirits,
40   Demons and nether powers, all living things,
41   Hosts of the earth, with the departed dead
42   In their dark state of mystery, alike
43   Subjected are!—And I will strongly do it.—
44   Ah! would I could! Some hidden powerful hindrance
45   Doth hold me back, and mars all thought.—

[ After a pause, in which she stands fixed with her arms crossed on her breast.
46   Dread intercourse!
47   O! if it look on me with its dead eyes!
48   If it should move its lock'd and earthy lips,
49   And utt'rance give to the grave's hollow sounds!
50   If it stretch forth its cold and bony grasp—
51   O horror, horror!

[ Sinking lower at every successive idea, as she repeats these four last lines, till she is quite upon her knees on the ground.
52   Would that beneath these planks of senseless matter
53   I could, until the dreadful hour is past,
54   As senseless be!

[ Striking the floor with her hands.
55   O open and receive me,
56   Ye happy things of still and lifeless being,
57   That to the awful steps which tread upon ye
58   Unconscious are!

Enter Cathrina behind her.
59   Who's there? Is't any thing?

Cath.
60   'Tis I, my dearest lady; 'tis Cathrina.

Orra

( embracing her ).
61   How kind! such blessed kindness keep thee by me;
62   I'll hold thee fast; an angel brought thee hither.
63   I needs must weep to think thou art so kind
64   In mine extremity.—Where wert thou hid?

Cath.
65   In that small closet, since the supper hour,
66   I've been conceal'd. For searching round the chamber,
67   I found its door and enter'd. Fear not now,
68   I will not leave thee till the break of day.



[Page 253]
Orra.
69   Heaven bless thee for it! Till the break of day!
70   The very thought of daybreak gives me life.
71   If but this night were past, I have good hope
72   That noble Theobald will soon be here
73   For my deliv'rance.

Cath.
73                                            Wherefore thinkst thou so?

Orra.
74   A stranger, when thou leftst me on the ramparts,
75   Gave me a letter, which I quickly open'd,
76   As soon as I, methought, had gain'd my room
77   In privacy; but close behind me came
78   That demon, Rudigere, and, snatching at it,
79   Forced me to cast it to the flames, from which,
80   I struggling with him still, he could not save it.

Cath.
81   You have not read it then?

Orra.
81                                            No; but the seal
82   Was Theobald's, and I could swear ere long
83   He will be here to free me from this thraldom.

Cath.
84   God grant he may!

Orra.
85   If but this night were past! How goes the time?
86   Has it not enter'd on the midnight watch?

Cath.

( pointing to a small slab at the corner of the stage on which is placed a sand-glass ).
87   That Glass I've set to measure it. As soon
88   As all the sand is run, you are secure;
89   The midnight watch is past.

Orra

( running to the glass, and looking at it eagerly ).
90   There is not much to run; O an't were finish'd!
91   But it so slowly runs!

Cath.
91                                            Yes; watching it,
92   It seemeth slow. But heed it not; the while,
93   I'll tell thee some old tale, and ere I've finish'd,
94   The midnight watch is gone. Sit down, I pray.

[ They sit , Orra drawing her chair close to Cathrina .
95   What story shall I tell thee?

Orra.
96   Something, my friend, which thou thyself hast known,
97   Touching the awful intercourse which spirits
98   With mortal men have held at this dread hour.
99   Didst thou thyself e'er meet with one whose eyes
100   Had look'd upon the spectred dead—had seen
101   Forms from another world?

Cath.
101                                            Never but once.

Orra

( eagerly ).
102   Once then thou didst. O tell it! tell it me!

Cath.
103   Well, since I needs must tell it, once I knew
104   A melancholy man, who did aver,
105   That journeying on a time o'er a wild waste,
106   By a fell storm o'erta'en, he was compell'd
107   To pass the night in a deserted tower,
108   Where a poor hind, the sole inhabitant
109   Of the sad place, prepared for him a bed:
110   And, as he told his tale, at dead of night,
111   By the pale lamp that in his chamber burn'd
112   As it might be an arm's-length from his bed—

Orra.
113   So close upon him?

Cath.
113                                            Yes.

Orra.
113                        Go on; what saw he?

Cath.
114   An upright form, wound in a clotted shroud—
115   Clotted and stiff, like one swath'd up in haste
116   After a bloody death.

Orra.
116                                            O horrible!

Cath.
117   He started from his bed and gazed upon it.

Orra.
118   And did he speak to it?

Cath.
118                                            He could not speak.
119   Its visage was uncover'd, and at first
120   Seem'd fix'd and shrunk, like one in coffin'd sleep;
121   But, as he gaz'd, there came, he wist not how,
122   Into its beamless eyes a horrid glare,
123   And turning towards him, for it did move—
124   Why dost thou grasp me thus?

Orra.
125   Go on, go on!

Cath.
126   Nay, heaven forefend! Thy shrunk and sharpen'd features
127   Are of the corse's colour, and thine eyes
128   Are full of tears. How's this?

Orra.
128                                            I know not how.
129   A horrid sympathy jarr'd on my heart,
130   And forced into mine eyes these icy tears.
131   A fearful kindredship there is between
132   The living and the dead—an awful bond!
133   Woe's me! that we do shudder at ourselves—
134   At that which we must be!—A dismal thought!
135   Where dost thou run? thy story is not told.


[ Seeing Cath . go towards the sand-glass.
Cath.

( showing the glass ).
136   A better story I will tell thee now;
137   The midnight watch is past.

Orra.
138   Ha! let me see.

Cath.
138                                            There's not one sand to run.

Orra.
139   But it is barely past.

Cath.
139                                            'Tis more than past.
140   For I did set it later than the hour,
141   To be assur'dly sure.

Orra.
142   Then it is gone indeed. O heaven be praised!
143   The fearful gloom gone by!

[ Holding up her hands in gratitude to heaven, and then looking round her with cheerful animation.
143                                            In truth, already
144   I feel as if I breath'd the morning air;
145   I'm marvellously lighten'd.

Cath.
145                                            Ne'ertheless,
146   Thou art forespent; I'll run to my apartment,
147   And fetch some cordial drops that will revive thee.

Orra.
148   Thou needst not go; I've ta'en thy drops already;
149   I'm bold and buoyant grown.


[ Bounding lightly from the floor.
Cath.
149                                            I'll soon return;
150   Thou art not fearful now?



[Page 254]
Orra.
150                                            No; I breathe lightly;
151   Valour within me grows most powerfully,
152   Wouldst thou but stay to see it, gentle Cathrine!

Cath.
153   I will return to see it, ere thou canst
154   Three times repeat the letters of thy name.


[ Exit hastily by the concealed door.
Orra.

( alone ).
155   This burst of courage shrinks most shamefully.
156   I'll follow her.—

[ Striving to open the door.
156                                            'Tis fast; it will not open.
157   I'll count my footsteps as I pace the floor
158   Till she return again.
[ Paces up and down, muttering to herself, when a horn is heard without, pausing and sounding three times, each time louder than before.

[ Orra runs again to the door.

159   Despair will give me strength; where is the door?
160   Mine eyes are dark, I cannot find it now.
161   O God! protect me in this awful pass!

[ After a pause, in which she stands with her body bent in a cowering posture, with her hands locked together, and trembling violently, she starts up and looks wildly round her.
162   There's nothing, yet I felt a chilly hand
163   Upon my shoulder press'd. With open'd eyes
164   And ears intent I'll stand. Better it is
165   Thus to abide the awful visitation,
166   Than cower in blinded horror, strain'd intensely
167   With ev'ry beating of my goaded heart.

[ Looking round her with a steady sternness, but shrinking again almost immediately.
168   I cannot do it: on this spot I'll hold me
169   In awful stillness.

[ Bending her body as before; then, after a momentary pause, pressing both her hands upon her head.
170   The icy scalp of fear is on my head;
171   The life stirs in my hair; it is a sense
172   That tells the nearing of unearthly steps,
173   Albeit my ringing ears no sounds distinguish.


[ Looking round, as if by irresistible impulse, to a great door at the bottom of the stage, which bursts open, and the form of a huntsman, clothed in black, with a horn in his hand, enters and advances towards her. She utters a loud shriek, and falls senseless on the ground.
Theo.

( running up to her, and raising her from the ground ).
174   No semblance, but real agony of fear.
175   Orra, oh, Orra! knowst thou not my voice?
176   Thy knight, thy champion, the devoted Theobald?
177   Open thine eyes and look upon my face:

[ Unmasking.
178   I am no fearful waker from the grave.
179   Dost thou not feel? 'Tis the warm touch of life.
180   Look up, and fear will vanish.—Words are vain!
181   What a pale countenance of ghastly strength
182   By horror chang'd! O idiot that I was
183   To hazard this—The villain hath deceiv'd me:
184   My letter she has ne'er receiv'd. O fool!
185   That I should trust to this!


[ Beating his head distractedly.

Enter Franko , by the same door.
Franko.
186   What is the matter? what strange turn is this?

Theo.
187   O cursed sanguine fool! could I not think—
188   She moves, she moves!—rouse thee, my gentle Orra!
189   'Tis no strange voice that calls thee; 'tis thy friend.

Franko.
190   She opens now her eyes.

Theo.
191   But, oh, that look!

Franko.
192   She knows thee not, but gives a stifled groan,
193   And sinks again in stupor.
194   Make no more fruitless lamentation here,
195   But bear her hence: the cool and open air
196   May soon restore her. Let us, while we may,
197   Occasion seize, lest we should be surprised.


[ Exeunt : Orra borne off in a state of insensibility.
ACT V. SCENE I.
The great hall of the castle. Enter Rudigere, Cathrina , and Attendants, by different doors.
Rud.

( to attend. )
1   Return'd again! Is any thing discover'd?
2   Or door or passage, garment dropt in haste,
3   Or footstep's track, or any mark of flight?

1 st att.
4   No, by my faith! though we have search'd the castle
5   From its high turret to its deepest vault.

Cath.
6   'Tis vain to trace the marks of trackless feet.
7   If that in truth it hath convey'd her hence,
8   The yawning earth has yielded them a passage,
9   Or else, through rifted roofs, the buoyant air.

Rud.
10   Fools! search again. I'll raze the very walls
11   From their foundations, but I will discover
12   If door or pass there be to us unknown.
13   Ho! Gomez, there!

[ Calling off the stage.
13                                            He keeps himself aloof:
14   Nor aids the search with true and hearty will.
15   I am betray'd—Ho! Gomez, there, I say!
16   He shrinks away: go, drag the villain hither,
17   And let the torture wring confession from him.

[ A loud knocking heard at the gate.
18   Ha! who seeks entrance at this early hour
19   In such a desert place?

Cath.
19                                            Some hind, perhaps,
20   Who brings intelligence. Heaven grant it be!



[Page 255]

Enter an armed Vassal.
Rud.
21   Ha! one from Aldenberg! what brings thee hither?

Vass.

( seizing Rud .)
22   Thou art my prisoner.
( To attendants. )
Upon you peril,
23   Assist me to secure him.

Rud.
24   Audacious hind! by what authority
25   Speakst thou such bold commands? Produce thy warrant.

Vass.
26   'Tis at the gate, and such as thou must yield to:
27   Count Hughobert himself, with armed men,
28   A goodly band, his pleasure to enforce.


[ Secures him.
Rud.
29   What sudden freak is this? am I suspected
30   Of aught but true and honourable faith?

Vass.
31   Ay, by our holy saints! more than suspected.
32   Thy creature Maurice, whom thou thought'st to bribe
33   With things of seeming value, hath discover'd
34   The cunning fraud; on which his tender conscience,
35   Good soul! did o' the sudden so upbraid him,
36   That to his lord forthwith he made confession
37   Of all the plots against the Lady Orra,
38   In which thy wicked arts had tempted him
39   To take a wicked part. All is discover'd.

Cath.

( aside ).
40   All is discover'd! Where then shall I hide me?

( Aloud to vass. )
41   What is discover'd?

Vass.
41                                            Ha! most virtuous lady!
42   Art thou alarm'd? Fear not: the world well knows
43   How good thou art; and to the countess shortly,
44   Who with her lord is near, thou wilt no doubt
45   Give good account of all that thou hast done.

Cath.

( aside, as she retires in agitation ).
46   O heaven forbid! What hole o' th' earth will hide me!


[ Exit.

Enter by the opposite side , Hughobert, Eleanora, Alice, Glottenbal, Urston, Maurice , and Attendants.
Hugh.

( speaking as he enters ).
47   Is he secured?

Vass.
47                                            He is, my lord; behold!


[ Pointing to Rud .
Hugh.

( to Rud .)
48   Black, artful traitor! Of a sacred trust,
49   Blindly reposed in thee, the base betrayer
50   For wicked ends; full well upon the ground
51   Mayst thou decline those darkly frowning eyes,
52   And gnaw thy lip in shame.

Rud.
53   And rests no shame with him, whose easy faith
54   Entrusts a man unproved; or, having proved him,
55   Lets a poor hireling's unsupported testimony
56   Shake the firm confidence of many years?

Hugh.
57   Here the accuser stands; confront him boldly,
58   And spare him not.


[ Bringing forward Maurice .
Maur.

( to Rud .)
59   Deny it if thou canst. Thy brazen front,
60   All brazen as it is, denies it not.

Rud.

( to Maur .)
61   Fool! that of prying curiosity
62   And av'rice art compounded! I in truth
63   Did give to thee a counterfeited treasure
64   To bribe thee to a counterfeited trust;
65   Meet recompense! Ha, ha! Maintain thy tale,
66   For I deny it not.


[ With careless derision.
Maur.
66                                            O, subtle traitor!
67   Dost thou so varnish it with seeming mirth?

Hugh.
68   Sir Rudigere, thou dost, I must confess,
69   Outface him well. But call the Lady Orra;
70   If towards her thou hast thyself comported
71   In honesty, she will declare it freely.

( To attendant. )
72   Bring Orra hither.

1 st att.
73   Would that we could; last night i' the midnight watch
74   She disappear'd; but whether man or devil
75   Hath borne her hence, in truth we cannot tell.

Hugh.
76   O both! Both man and devil together join'd.

( To Rud . furiously. )
77   Fiend, villain, murderer! Produce her instantly.
78   Dead or alive, produce thy hapless charge.

Rud.
79   Restrain your rage, my lord; I would right gladly
80   Obey you, were it possible: the place,
81   And the mysterious means of her retreat,
82   Are both to me unknown.

Hugh.
82                                            Thou liest! thou liest!

Glot.

( coming forward ).
83   Thou liest, beast, villain, traitor! thinkst thou still
84   To fool us thus? Thou shalt be forced to speak.

( To Hugh .)
85   Why lose we time in words when other means
86   Will quickly work? Straight to those pillars bind him,
87   And let each sturdy varlet of your train
88   Inflict correction on him.

Maur.
89   Ay, this alone will move him.

Hugh.
89                                            Thou sayst well:
90   By heaven it shall be done!

Rud.
91   And will Count Hughobert degrade in me
92   The blood of Aldenberg to shame himself?

Hugh.
93   That plea avails thee not; thy spurious birth
94   Gives us full warrant, as thy conduct varies,
95   To reckon thee or noble or debased.

( To att. )
96   Straight bind the traitor to the place of shame.


[ As they are struggling to bind Rud . he gets one of his hands free, and, pulling out a dagger from under his clothes, stabs himself.
Rud.
97   Now, take your will of me, and drag my corse


[Page 256]
98   Through mire and dust; your shameless fury now
99   Can do me no disgrace.

Urston

( advancing ).
100   Rash, daring, thoughtless wretch! dost thou so close
101   A wicked life in hardy desperation?

Rud.
102   Priest, spare thy words: I add not to my sins
103   That of presumption, in pretending now
104   To offer up to heaven the forced repentance
105   Of some short moments for a life of crimes.

Urst.
106   My son, thou dost mistake me: let thy heart
107   Confession make—

Glot.

( interrupting Urst. )
107                                            Yes, dog! Confession make
108   Of what thou'st done with Orra; else I'll spurn thee,
109   And cast thy hateful carcass to the kites.

Hugh.

( pulling back Glot . as he is going to spurn Rud . with his foot, who is now fallen upon the ground ).
110   Nay, nay, forbear; such outrage is unmanly.


[ Eleanora , who with Alice had retired from the shocking sight of Rudigere , new comes forward to him.
El.
111   Oh, Rudigere! thou art a dying man,
112   And we will speak to thee without upbraiding.
113   Confess, I do entreat thee, ere thou goest
114   To thy most awful change, and leave us not
115   In this our horrible uncertainty.
116   Is Orra here conceal'd?

Al.
116                                            Thou hast not slain her?
117   Confession make, and heaven have mercy on thee!

Rud.
118   Yes, ladies; with these words of gentle meekness
119   My heart is changed; and that you may perceive
120   How greatly changed, let Glottenbal approach me;
121   Spent am I now, and can but faintly speak—
122   E'en unto him in token of forgiveness
123   I'll tell what ye desire.

El.
123                                            Thank heaven, thou art so changed!

Hugh.

( to Glot .)
124   Go to him, boy.


[ Glottenbal goes to Rudigere , and stooping over him to hear what he has to say , Rudigere , taking a small dagger from his bosom, strikes Glottenbal on the neck.
Glot.
125   Oh, he has wounded me!—Detested traitor!
126   Take that and that; would thou hadst still a life
127   For every thrust.


[ Killing him.
Hugh.

( alarmed ).
128   Ha! has he wounded thee. my son?

Glot.
128                                            A scratch;
129   'Tis nothing more. He aim'd it at my throat,
130   But had not strength to thrust.

Hugh.
130                                            Thank God, he had not!

[ A trumpet sounds without.
131   Hark! martial notice of some high approach!

( To attendants. )
132   Go to the gate.


[ Exeunt attendants.
El.
133   Who may it be? This castle is remote
134   From every route which armed leaders take.


Enter a Servant.
Serv.
135   The Banneret of Basle is at the gate.

Hugh.
136   Is he in force?

Serv.
137   Yes, through the trees his distant bands are seen
138   Some hundreds strong, I guess; though with himself
139   Two followers only come.


Enter Hartman attended.
Hugh.
140   Forgive me, banneret, if I receive thee
141   With more surprise than courtesy. How is it?
142   Com'st thou in peace?

Hart.
143   To you, my lord, I frankly will declare
144   The purpose of my coming: having heard it,
145   It is for you to say if I am come,
146   As much I wish, in peace.

( To El .)
147   Countess, your presence much emboldens me
148   To think it so shall be.

Hugh.

( impatiently ).
148                                            Proceed, I beg.
149   When burghers gentle courtesy affect,
150   It chafes me more than all their sturdy boasting.

Hart.
151   Then with a burgher's plainness, Hughobert,
152   I'll try my tale to tell,—nice task I fear!
153   So that it may not gall a baron's pride.
154   Brave Theobald, the lord of Falkenstein,
155   Co-burgher also of our ancient city,
156   Whose cause of course is ours, declares himself
157   The suitor of thy ward, the Lady Orra;
158   And learning that within these walls she is,
159   By thine authority, in durance kept,
160   In his behalf I come to set her free;
161   As an oppressed dame, such service claiming
162   From ev'ry gen'rous knight. What is thy answer?
163   Say, am I come in peace? Wilt thou release her?

Hugh.
164   Ah, would I could! In faith thou gall'st me shrewdly.

Hart.
165   I've been inform'd of all that now disturbs you,
166   By one who held me waiting at the gate.
167   Until the maid be found, if 'tis your pleasure,
168   Cease enmity.

Hugh.
169   Then let it cease. A traitor has deceived me,
170   And there he lies.


[ Pointing to the body of Rud .
Hart.

( looking at the body ).
171   A ghastly smile of fell malignity
172   On his distorted face death has arrested.

[ Turning again to Hugh .
173   And has he died, and no confession made?
174   All means that may discover Orra's fate
175   Shut from us?

Hugh.
176   Ah! the fiend hath utter'd nothing
177   That could betray his secret. If she lives—



[Page 257]
El.
178   Alas, alas! think you he murder'd her?

Al.
179   Merciful heaven forefend!


Enter a Soldier in haste.
Sold.
180   O, I have heard a voice, a dismal voice!

Omnes.
181   What hast thou heard?

El.
181                        What voice?

Sold.
181                                            The Lady Orra's.

El.
182   Where? Lead us to the place.

Hugh.
183   Where didst thou heart it, soldier?

Sold.
184   In a deep-tangled thicket of the wood,
185   Close to a ruin'd wall, o'ergrown with ivy,
186   That marks the ancient outworks of the castle.

Hugh.
187   Haste; lead the way.


[ Exeunt all eagerly, without order, following the soldier , Glottenbal and one attendant excepted.
Att.
188   You do not go, my lord?

Glot.
189   I'm sick, and strangely dizzy grows my head,
190   And pains shoot from my wound. It is a scratch,
191   But from a devil's fang.—There's mischief in it.
192   Give me thine arm, and lead me to a couch:
193   I'm very faint.

Att.
194   This way, my lord; there is a chamber near.


[ Exit Glottenbal , Supported by the attendant.
SCENE II.
The forest near the castle; in front a rocky bank crowned with a ruined wall overgrown with ivy, and the mouth of a cavern shaded with bushes. Enter Franko , conducting Hughobert, Hartman, Eleanora, Alice , and Urston , the Soldier following them.
Franko

( to Hugh .).
1   This is the entry to our secret haunts.
2   And now, my lord, having inform'd you truly
3   Of the device, well meant, but most unhappy,
4   By which the Lady Orra from her prison
5   By Falkenstein was ta'en, myself, my outlaws,
6   Unhappy men—who better days have seen,
7   Driv'n to this lawless life by hard necessity,
8   Are on your mercy cast.

Hugh.
9   Which shall not fail you, valiant Franko. Much
10   Am I indebted to thee: hadst thou not
11   Of thine own free good will become our guide,
12   As wand'ring here thou foundst us, we had ne'er
13   The spot discover'd; for this honest soldier,
14   A stranger to the forest, sought in vain
15   To thread the tangled path.

El.

( to Franko ).
16   She is not well, thou sayst, and from her swoon
17   Imperfectly recover'd.

Franko.
17                                            When I left her,
18   She so appear'd.—But enter not, I pray,
19   Till I give notice.—Holla, you within!
20   Come forth and fear no ill.


[ A shriek heard from the cave.
Omnes.
21   What dismal shriek is that?

Al.
21                                            'Tis Orra's voice.

El.
22   No, no! it cannot be! It is some wretch,
23   In maniac's fetters bound.

Hart.
24   The horrid thought that bursts into my mind!
25   Forbid it, righteous Heaven!


[ Running into the cave, he is prevented by Theobald , who rushes out upon him.
Theo.
26   Hold, hold! no entry here but o'er my corse,
27   When ye have master'd me.

Hart.
27                                            My Theobald,
28   Dost thou not know thy friends?

Theo.
29   Ha! thou, my Hartman! Art thou come to me?

Hart.
30   Yes, I am come. What means that look of anguish?
31   She is not dead!

Theo.
31                                            Oh, no! it is not death!

Hart.
32   What meanst thou? Is she well?

Theo.
32                                            Her body is.

Hart.
33   And not her mind?—Oh! direst wreck of all!
34   That noble mind!—But 'tis some passing seizure,
35   Some powerful movement of a transient nature;
36   It is not madness?

Theo.

( shrinking from him, and bursting into tears ).
37   'Tis heaven's infliction; let us call it so;
38   Give it no other name.


[ Covering his face.
El.

( to Theo .)
39   Nay, do not thus despair: when she beholds us,
40   She'll know her friends, and, by our kindly soothing,
41   Be gradually restored.

Al.
42   Let me go to her.

Theo.
42                                            Nay, forbear, I pray thee;
43   I will myself with thee, my worthy Hartman,
44   Go in and lead her forth.


[ Theobald and Hartman go into the cavern, while those without wait in deep silence, which is only broken once or twice by a scream from the cavern and the sound of Theobald ' s voice speaking soothingly, till they return, leading forth Orra , with her hair and dress disordered, and the appearance of wild distraction in her gait and countenance.
Orra

( shrinking back as she comes from under the shade of the trees, &c. and dragging Theobald and Hartman back with her ).
45   Come back, come back! The fierce and fiery light!

Theo.
46   Shrink not, dear love! it is the light of day.

Orra.
47   Have cocks crow'd yet?

Theo.
47                                            Yes; twice I've heard already
48   Their matin sound. Look up to the blue sky;


[Page 258]
49   Is it not daylight there? And these green boughs
50   Are fresh and fragrant round thee: every sense
51   Tells thee it is the cheerful early day.

Orra.
52   Ay, so it is; day takes his daily turn,
53   Rising between the gulfy dells of night
54   Like whiten'd billows on a gloomy sea;
55   Till glow-worms gleam, and stars peep through the dark,
56   And will-o'-the-wisp his dancing taper light,
57   They will not come again.

[ Bending her ear to the ground.
58   Hark, hark! Ay, hark!
59   They are all there: I hear their hollow sound
60   Full many a fathom down.

Theo.
61   Be still, poor troubled soul! they'll ne'er return:
62   They are for ever gone. Be well assured
63   Thou shalt from henceforth have a cheerful home
64   With crackling faggots on thy midnight fire,
65   Blazing like day around thee; and thy friends—
66   Thy living, loving friends still by thy side,
67   To speak to thee and cheer thee.—See, my Orra!
68   They are beside thee now; dost thou not know them?


( Pointing to Eleanora and Alice. )
Orra

( gazing at them with her hand held up to shade her eyes ).
69   No, no! athwart the wav'ring garish light,
70   Things move and seem to be, and yet are nothing.

El.

( going near her ).
71   My gentle Orra! hast thou then forgot me?
72   Dost thou not know my voice?

Orra.
73   'Tis like an old tune to my ear return'd.
74   For there be those, who sit in cheerful halls,
75   And breathe sweet air, and speak with pleasant sounds;
76   And once I liv'd with such; some years gone by;
77   I wot not now how long.

Hugh.
78   Keen words that rend my heart!—Thou hadst a home,
79   And one whose faith was pledged for thy protection.

Urst.
80   Be more composed, my lord, some faint remembrance
81   Returns upon her with the well-known sound
82   Of voices once familiar to her ear.
83   Let Alice sing to her some fav'rite tune,
84   That may lost thoughts recall.


[ Alice sings an old tune, and Orra , who listens eagerly and gazes on her while she sings, afterwards bursts into a wild laugh.
Orra.
85   Ha, ha! the witched air sings for thee bravely.
86   Hoot owls through mantling fog for matin birds?
87   It lures not me. — I know thee well enough:
88   The bones of murder'd men thy measure beat,
89   And fleshless heads nod to thee.—Off, I say!
90   Why are ye here?—That is the blessed sun.

El.
91   Ah, Orra! do not look upon us thus!
92   These are the voices of thy loving friends
93   That speak to thee: this is a friendly hand
94   That presses thine so kindly.


[ Putting her hand upon Orra ' s, who gives a loud shriek, and shrinks from her with horror.
Hart.
95   O grievous state.
( Going up to her. )
What terror seizes thee?

Orra.
96   Take it away! It was the swathed dead!
97   I know its clammy, chill, and bony touch.

[ Fixing her eyes fiercely on Eleanora .
98   Come not again; I'm strong and terrible now:
99   Mine eyes have look'd upon all dreadful things;
100   And when the earth yawns, and the hell-blast sounds,
101   I'll 'bide the trooping of unearthly steps
102   With stiff-clench'd, terrible strength.


[ Holding her clenched hands over her head with an air of grandeur and defiance.
Hugh.

( beating his breast ).
103   A murd'rer is a guiltless wretch to me.

Hart.
104   Be patient; 'tis a momentary pitch;
105   Let me encounter it.


[ Goes up to Orra , and fixes his eyes upon her, which she, after a moment, shrinks from and seeks to avoid, yet still, as if involuntarily, looks at him again.
Orra.
106   Take off from me thy strangely-fasten'd eye:
107   I may not look upon thee, yet I must.

[ Still turning from him, and still snatching a hasty look at him as before.
108   Unfix thy baleful glance: art thou a snake?
109   Something of horrid power within thee dwells.
110   Still, still that powerful eye doth such me in
111   Like a dark eddy to its wheeling core.
112   Spare me! O spare me, being of strange power,
113   And at thy feet my subject head I'll lay!


[ Kneeling to Hartman and bending her head submissively.
El.
114   Alas the piteous sight! to see her thus;
115   The noble generous, playful, stately Orra!

Theo.

( running to Hartman , and pushing him away with indignation ).
116   Out on thy hateful and ungenerous guile!
117   Thinkst thou I'll suffer o'er her wretched state
118   The slightest shadow of a base control?

[ Raising Orra from the ground.
119   No, rise thou stately flower with rude blasts rent:
120   As honour'd art thou with thy broken stem,
121   And leaflets strew'd, as in thy summer's pride.
122   I've seen thee worshipp'd like a regal dame
123   With every studied form of mark'd devotion,
124   Whilst I in distant silence, scarcely proffer'd
125   E'en a plain soldier's courtesy; but now,
126   No liege-man to his crowned mistress sworn,
127   Bound and devoted is, as I to thee;
128   And he who offers to thy alter'd state
129   The slightest seeming of diminish'd revirence,
130   Must in my blood—
( To Hartman .)
O pardon me, my friend!
131   Thou'st wrung my heart.

Hart.
132   Nay, do thou pardon me: I am to blame:
133   Thy nobler heart shall not again be wrung.


[Page 259]
134   But what can now be done? O'er such wild ravings
135   There must be some control.

Theo.
136   O none! none, none! but gentle sympathy
137   And watchfulness of love.
137                                            My noble Orra!
138   Wander where'er thou wilt; thy vagrant steps
139   Shall follow'd be by one, who shall not weary,
140   Nor e'er detach him from his hopeless task;
141   Bound to thee now as fairest, gentlest beauty
142   Could ne'er have bound him.

Al.
143   See how she gazes on him with a look,
144   Subsiding gradually to softer sadness.
145   Half saying that she knows him.

El.
146   There is a kindness in her changing eye.
147   Yes, Orra, 'tis the valiant Theobald,
148   Thy knight and champion, whom thou gazest on.

Orra.
149   The brave are like the brave; so should it be.
150   He was a goodly man—a noble knight.

( To Theobald .)
151   What is thy name, young soldier?—Woe is me!
152   For prayers of grace are said o'er dying men,
153   Yet they have laid thy clay in unblest earth—
154   Shame! shame! not with the still'd and holy dead.
155   This shall be rectified; I'll find it out;
156   And masses shall be said for thy repose;
157   Thou shalt not troop with these.

El.
158   'Tis not the dead, 'tis Theobald himself,
159   Alive and well, who standeth by thy side.

Orra

( looking wildly round ).
160   Where, where? All dreadful things are near me. round me,
161   Beneath my feet and in the loaded air.
162   Let him begone! The place is horrible!
163   Baneful to flesh and blood.—The dreadful blast!
164   Their hounds now yell below i' the centre gulph;
165   They may not rise again till solemn bells
166   Have giv'n the stroke that severs night from morn.

El.
167   O rave not thus! Dost thou not know us, Orra?

Orra

( hastily ).
168   Ay, well enough I know ye.

Urst.
169   Ha! think ye that she does?

El.
170   It is a terrible smile of recognition,
171   If such it be.

Hart.
172   Nay, do not thus your restless eye-balls move,
173   But look upon us steadily, sweet Orra.

Orra.
174   Away! your faces waver to and fro;
175   I'll know you better in your winding-sheets,
176   When the moon shines upon you.

Theo.
177   Give o'er, my friends; you see it is in vain;
178   Her mind within itself holds a dark world
179   Of dismal phantasies and horrid forms!
180   Contend with her no more.


Enter an attendant in an abrupt disturbed manner.
Att.

( to Eleanora , aside ).
181   Lady, I bring to you most dismal news:
182   Too grievous for my lord, so suddenly
183   And unprepar'd to hear.

El.

( aside ).
183                                            What is it? Speak.

Att.

( aside to El )
184   His son is dead, all swell'd and rack'd withpain;
185   And on the dagger's point, which the sly traitor
186   Still in his stiffen'd grasp retains, foul stains,
187   Like those of limed poison, show full well
188   The wicked cause of his untimely death.

Hugh.

( overhearing them ).
189   Who speaks of death? What didst thou whisper there?
190   How is my son?—What look is that thou wearst?
191   He is not dead?—Thou dost not speak! O God!
192   I have no son.

[ After a pause.
192                                            I am bereft!—But this!
193   But only him!—Heaven's vengeance deals the stroke.

Urst.
194   Heaven oft in mercy smites, e'en when the blow
195   Is most severe.

Hugh.
195                                            I had no other hope.
196   Fell is the stroke, if mercy in it be!
197   Could this—could this alone atone my crime?

Urst.
198   Submit thy soul to Heaven's all-wise decree.
199   Perhaps his life had blasted more thy hopes
200   Than e'en his grievous end.

Hugh.
201   He was not all a father's heart could wish;
202   But, oh! he was my son!—my only son:
203   My child—the thing that from his cradle grew,
204   And was before me still.—Oh, oh! Oh, oh!


[ Beating his breast and groaning deeply.
Orra

( running up to him ).
205   Ha! dost thou groan, old man? art thou in trouble?
206   Out on it! though they lay him in the mould,
207   He's near thee still.—I'll tell thee how it is:
208   A hideous burst hath been: the damn'd and holy,
209   The living and the dead, together are
210   In horrid neighbourship—'Tis but thin vapour,
211   Floating around thee, makes the wav'ring bound.
212   Pooh! blow it off, and see th' uncurtain'd reach.
213   See! from all points they come; earth casts them up!
214   In grave-clothes swath'd are those but new in death;
215   And there be some half bone, half cased in shreds
216   Of that which flesh hath been; and there be some
217   With wicker'd ribs, through which the darkness scowls.
218   Back, back!—They close upon us.—Oh! the void
219   Of hollow unball'd sockets staring grimly,
220   And lipless jaws that move and clatter round us
221   In mockery of speech!—Back, back, I say!
222   Back, back!


[ Catching hold of Hughobert and Theobald , and dragging them back with her in all the wild strength of frantic horror, whilst the curtain drops.
