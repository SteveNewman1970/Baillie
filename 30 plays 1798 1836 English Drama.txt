Main text ACT I SCENE I. —A Room at an Inn.—Bells Ringing. Enter Mrs. Bell , R. Mrs. B. Here I am.—Susan!
Enter Susan , L. Sus. Here I am, ma'am.
Mrs. B. And where's the rest of you? Don't you hear Mr. Sandford's bell?
Sus. Thomas is gone, ma'am.
Mrs. B. And where's Billy?
Sus. Lord, ma'am, I don't know where he is—not I! In some corner, I suppose, reading his stupid novels, as usual.
Mrs. B. He grows worse and worse! I must turn over a new leaf with him, or he'll positively be good for nothing. If we hadn't had him from a babby , there would be no enduring him. But he's like one of the family now, poor lad!
Sus. He does no honor to it, I'm sure.
Mrs. B. Why, what has he done to you, Susan? You've been setting your cap at him, I suppose?
Sus. Ma'am, he has plagued me enough, with his love, and foolish speeches out of the library books. I wonder you don't burn 'em, madam,—he's grown quite an oaf with 'em;—and now, all of a sudden, he's taken to follow Fanny —I beg pardon, Miss Fanny, I should have said—your fine ladyfied niece, ma'am.
Mrs. B. And she'll treat him as he deserves, as you should do. Who listens to over-grown boys? Mind your [25]   business, girl, and don't let the fellows make a fool of you.
Sus. He sha'n't make a fool of me, that I promise him!
                                         [Exit, L.
[Page 6]
Mrs. B. You may as well wean a child from the rattle as the wenches from the fellows, say what you will. So it always was, and so it always will be. I am much afraid Mr. Franklin's wife, my newly adopted niece, will set the house in a ferment before the frolic's at an end. Poor soul! she's in an awkward situation, that's certain. Heaven send her safe out of it!
Cha. (without, L.) Why, house! where's Mrs. Bell? How's my father?
Enter Susan , L. Mrs. B. What's that, Susan?
Sus. The London coach, ma'am. Young Mr. Franklin's arrived—I'll wait on him.
                                         [Exit Susan . Mrs. B. I thought we should soon see him.
Cha. (without, L.) Where is she?
Enter Charles , L. Cha. Ah!
Mrs. B. Mr. Charles!—
Cha. My dear Mrs. Bell!—how happy I am to see you! You're the very best friend I have in the world!
Mrs. B. One of the best I ought to be, for I am one of the oldest. Ah! you used to be a sad pickle—a sad plague to the girls, Mr. Charles!
Cha. Ay, but I am reformed now—a staid, sober, married man. Well, and how do you come on? How does our [50]   masquerade succeed? How is my father? How is my cousin? And how does my dear little wife?
Mrs. B. Why, your father is as well as can be expected. Your cousin that is—your wife that expects to be—you faithless man!
Cha. Ah!
Mrs. B. She is as well as can be expected.
Cha. I am very happy to hear it.
Mrs. B. And your dear little wife that is —she is—
Cha. As well as can be expected, too, I hope?
Mrs. B. Better! Better than your best hopes. She is now attending your father in his morning walk, and at his own express desire!
Cha. Excellent! Then she is really making an impression!
Mrs. B. Impression? Take care, Mr. Charles, he is actually becoming your rival!
Cha. Ha, ha, ha! I suspected it.
Mrs. B. He'll be attended by nobody else. The offices of
[Page 7]
his niece, his valet,—in short, every assistance he can have from Fanny, he shifts upon her in preference.
Cha. So far, all goes on as we could wish;—but the disclosure—that's the great point. There will be the trial, Mrs. Bell!
Mrs. B. How so? You make it a good match?
Cha. An excellent one, nobody can deny it! Eugenia is [75]   good, rich, and beautiful! and who could resist her? Her father was my friend—my father's friend—whom he had a thousand times lamented to have quarreled with. In his dying hours I attended him to the last! With a grateful heart, he seemed to commit his daughter to my protection. And, after his death, there I lingered, falling deeper and deeper in love with her; and constantly reminded, in my father's letters, of my engagement with my cousin Laura.
Mrs. B. Ah! it was a trying scene, Mr. Charles.
Cha. It was; indeed it was, Mrs. Bell; and when, at last, I talked, as it was high time I should, of fixing a period for returning home, in the tender simplicity of her heart, “Oh, Mr. Franklin!” said she, “I wish it was worth your while never to part from me.”
Mrs. B. What could you say to that?
Cha. Not a word; my honour, my principle, forbad it. I merely gazed at her in silence, until my heart was bursting; then took her to my arms, wept over her for an hour, and married her the next morning.
Mrs. B. And what a happy creature you must have made her?
Cha. Yes; but what a wretch I've made my poor cousin.
Mrs. B. I'm not sure of that.
Cha. Oh! but I am. I have heard, from the best authority, that her head is full of nothing else but her approaching [100]   marriage. A first love, you know—it's very natural— Heaven grant her patience!
Mrs. B. Amen! with all my heart.
Cha. To have married her and have loved Eugenia, would only have made matters worse; and could I help loving her?
Mrs. B. Ay! or how could one help showing it, when you landed your wife here. It was lucky for you, your father sent you off to London, or, with your unguarded feelings, you would most certainly have betrayed yourself before the time.
Cha. Nothing more likely. I wish you could tell when would be the time?
Mrs. B. Ask your wife. I'm not afraid: the Admiral
[Page 8]
has been a generous master to me. When I married, he set me up in this hotel; aye! and he'll be a generous father to you.
Cha. That he has been, Mrs. Bell.
Mrs. B. He has an excellent heart.
Cha. Yes; but, unfortunately, a devilish strong head. Whoever turns him from his humour works a miracle.
Mrs. B. It will be no miracle to your Eugenia, take my word for it; but, to prevent your taking her by surprise, I'll go and give her a hint of your coming, that you may understand each other before your father.
                                         (Crosses to L.) Cha. [125]   My dear Mrs. Bell, I'm so much obliged to you.
Mrs. B. Keep up your spirits, Mr. Charles, and fear nothing.
                                         [Exit Mrs. Bell , L. Cha. That's a very good little woman; but say what she will, we're in a very devilish predicament: let Eugenia win upon him ever so, as Fanny, the chambermaid, the very deception we have practised may possibly aggravate his humour against us. And then, poor Laura! How shall I meet her—how break the secret—how soften to her such merciless intelligence?
                                         [Exit Charles , R. SCENE II. —The Garden of the Inn, with a View of the Sea—the Villa of the Admiral , in an unfinished state, R. —the Entrance of the Inn, L. Billy Lackaday discovered, reading.— “The moment Anna Maria entered the room, the Captain started—the blood rushed into his face—his eyes swam in his head—his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth—his knees quivered—his heart palpitated, and his whole frame was in a state of uncountable confusion.”—Oh!—“He approached, and knelt before her; Anna Maria sighed, and, with a flood of tears, rushed into his arms!” I can't bear to read any more. Oh, if ever I should be in such a condition with Miss Fanny!
Enter Curtis, R. Thus it is, at any time, to serve a young master; though mine, certainly, till within these few days, united all the steadiness of threescore with the good-humour of five-and-twenty: now, 'tis quite another thing; I guess what ails him; he has fallen in love with this young lady, the admiral's niece, and there is some great objection to his paying his addresses; however, if we are to take our departure, the
[Page 9]
sooner I light on Mrs. Bell, the better. There's that blockhead greasing the leaves of some novel, as usual, instead of minding his business; and when the circulating library puts him out of spirits, he flies to the cellar for consolation: an odd compound of grief and grog. Hollo, Billy!
Bil. Oh! I'll trouble you not to—Be gentle, old gentleman, my nerves are delicate.
Cur. Delicate! Your mistress spoils you; you want a [25]   good master to set you to rights, Mr. Billy.—What business have you to read?
Bil. Because Miss Biddy Bell says, it humanizes one— this here corresponds with my situation.
Cur. Yes, and a lively correspondence it seems to be; and poor Mrs. Bell pays the postage, I suppose.
Bil. Ah! Mr. Curtis, Mr. Curtis! Human nature, human nature, Mr. Curtis!
Cur. Well!
Bil. When spring comes in all its wernal beauty, and the primroses peep out, and the birds begin to sing, don't you feel all over I don't know how like?
Cur. I used to feel very loving; but now, I've learned to mind my business.
Bil. Why, true, it's nigh time you did; you're in the wale o' years.
Cur. What!
Bil. You're in the wale o' years—winter's a-spreading her charms a-top o' your head.
Cur. What do you mean? Where do you see any signs of snow?
Bil. (examining.) No, no, it's but a sort of sleet,—half white, and half black.
Cur. You're an impudent fellow!
Bil. You does me wrong! sure, love is always modest: [50]   Fanny, that 'ere black-eyed beauty, the moment I set eyes on her, the blood rushes into my face—my eyes begin a-swimming in my head—my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth—my knees totter—my nerves quiver—my heart palpitates—
Cur. Heydey! what the devil!—
Bil. And my whole frame is in a state of uncountable confusion!
Cur. Enough to confuse any one's frame.
Bil. Ah! Mr. Curtis, sometimes I sits in the laylock bower, and sighs by the hour together.
Cur. Ah! that's when you're muzzy, I suppose?
Bil. Muzzy! Ah! Mr. Curtis, don't think that I am ever
[Page 10]
intoxicated. It's all grief and melancholy; I'm very, very unhappy, and your features tell me you're a man of feeling.
Cur. Not I.
Bil. Ah, yes! I'm sure you're a pitiful person—a moral and ineffectual character, and looks upon a wretch like me as your brother.
Cur. Heaven forbid!
Bil. I'll tell you my story.
Cur. No; I won't trouble you.
Bil. I'll pour out all my sorrows, and expose myself before you.
Cur. You've done that quite enough already. Where's your mistress?
Bil. [75]   I don't keep none, Mr. Curtis.
Cur. Mrs. Bell, I mean.
Bil. (significantly.) Mrs. Bell! Oh! Ay, Mrs. Bell!
Cur. Ay, Mrs. Bell.
Bil. You're as deep an old jockey as I know, in spite of them black and white locks; you've got a wernal touch upon you—you haven't lost your liquorish tooth yet, Mr. Curtis.
Cur. You foolish fellow, what do you mean?
Bil. Oh! my wenerable friend, you know som'at of the laylock as well as I do.
Cur. I?
Bil. Yes, you insinivating chap; who was you whispering to last night?—I'm up to snuff—Mrs. Bell's the hobject— you was hunfolding to her your interior secrets, I suppose?
Cur. Why, you stupid hound!
Bill. Law! what of it? I give you credit for it; if I could only ketch Miss Fanny in one of them tett-a-tetts .
                                         (Bell rings, L.) Cur. Don't you hear the bell?
Bil. To be sure I do.
Cur. And don't you mean to go?
Bil. If they perseveres: but, sometimes, after once or twice, they come down, and that saves a deal of trouble.
Cur. Well, you're a pleasant fellow.
Bil. Besides, that's the Admiral's bell, and he and I don't [100]   gee together. Miss Fanny always goes to him; and, what's very odd, she never let's nobody else. She's like you, Mr. Curtis, one of the Fancy, and knows the length of his gouty toe.
                                         (Bell rings.) Cur. There's another: you had better be going.
Bil. Yes, I ham a-going—going out of a world I'd better have never have come to. Miss Fanny's a-settling my business—she's
[Page 11]
a-killing me by hinches; and, maybe, she'll never drop a tear for me!
Cur. Likely enough.
Bil. Nor plant a daisy on my grave!
Cur. Nor pluck a buttercup off it, I warrant.
Bil. My days is numbered, like my napkins.—I languishes and pines away. Fate calls, and— (Bell rings.) —I'm coming!
                                         [Exit Billy , into pavilion, L. Cur. Mr. Billy, with all his nonsense, is more knave than fool. He has seen through my design on little Mrs. Bell. Well, let all the world know it—it's a fair match. Here's my master, come to scold, I'm afraid. Well, he's grown amorous, too, and I must expect to feel the consequences.
Enter Sandford , R. San. Curtis! Loitering in the garden—how's that? Have you packed up—paid the bill—ensured our berths? Didn't you understand me? I have determined upon sailing by the very next packet.
Cur. The very next, sir?
San. [125]   The very next, sir.
                                         (Crosses to L. Cur. Very well, sir! but as it's soon done, sir, suppose we wait till the evening?
San. Why so, sir?
Cur. Why, sir, I have packed up and unpacked three or four times already—not that I mind trouble, but it tumbles the things so—and who knows, but you may change your mind?
San. Why, hark'ye, Curtis! You're an old and faithful servant of the family: my father looked upon you as a friend—and so do I. Miss Laura is beautiful as an angel: full of charms, full of allurements, but utterly regardless of the use she makes of them. She will ensnare men's hearts only to trifle with their miseries. Why should she join her uncle in persuading me to stay?
Cur. I can't say, sir;—perhaps she may prefer you to the man she is engaged to;—but, if you don't love her, what does all that signify?
San. Nothing! nothing at all! it can signify nothing! She's contracted to another man.
Cur. Oh! that settles the matter at once. We must up directly.
San. Stay, Curtis. I understand Franklin's arrived?
Cur. So they say, sir.
San. Inquire after him, will you? I'll just shake him [150]   by the hand, and then—you may pack up immediately.

[Page 12]
Cur. The sooner the better, sir.
                                         [Exit Curtis , R. San. To trifle with my feelings any longer, would be inexcusable. I was just about to start upon my travels. To be stopped on my native shore—by what?—a trifler! who, with an engagement on her hands, attacks my heart; and, when she feels her success, seems one moment overcome with pity for my despair, and at another laughs at my embarrassment.
Enter Laura , R. Lau. I beg pardon! I disturb your solitude.
San. You are too apt, madam, to disturb my solitude; and yet well know, that I prize your society too highly.
Lau. Better than it deserves, you mean; and yet so little, that I vow, of late you seem determined to avoid me.
San. In shunning you, madam, I deserve your acknowledgments: your cousin is arrived, Charles Franklin, the son of your uncle, and, as you say, the son of your benefactor; I have no business here, and you ought to commend my discretion.
Lau. I do admire it, above all things. I protest, a more discreet young man I never met with.
San. It comes a little out of season; but my error is not irreparable; to-morrow I set sail.
Lau. Set sail!
San. You cannot be surprised, madam?
Lau. [175]   Indeed, but I am very much surprised.
San. Impossible! there are dangers to avoid. Your wedding is approaching, madam: some of the family would probably be kind enough to send me an invitation which would be—equally painful for me to refuse or accept.
Lau. But if I were to ask you to my wedding?
San. I should think you more unfeeling than I do at present.
Lau. You are very polite, sir, and extremely charitable; but, go, sir!—go, by all means.—Travel the wide world over; amuse yourself, and forget the friends you leave behind; find better, if you can; and when you've taught them to value and regret you, leave them, as you leave us, without a pang at parting.
San. Madam! madam! for Heaven's sake, why address me in terms like these? why force from me an avowal it is almost dishonourable to utter? Forget you—never! From my soul I love you, and with an ardour that defies fortitude!
Lau. Why this is excellent! This is speaking plainly, and to the purpose. Now I am satisfied.

[Page 13]
San. (surprised.) Madam!
Lau. This is all I desire.
San. And is this, madam, all the satisfaction I am to expect?
Lau. [200]   And what satisfaction do you expect, Mr. Sandford? You know my situation; my uncle has explained it repeatedly in your hearing. What satisfaction?—why, would you have me break my poor cousin's heart?
San. You should have considered that, madam, when first we met. Adieu!
Lau. Mr. Sandford!
San. What would you say, madam?
Lau. Simply this:—It strikes me that you love me, at least as well as my cousin Franklin; and, as one of you must be rejected, he, I think, is the man that will bear disappointment best.
San. Can you think him indifferent?
Lau. Indifferent!—no, poor wretch! that's quite out of the question. That he has set his heart upon me, I have no doubt in the world; and then he is so gay, so buoyant, so good-humoured, that when he finds I prefer another, don't think he'll travel the wide world over in search of consolation.
San. Are you so generous, so condescending? Oh, let me kneel!—
Lau. No, don't kneel; you'll set the family in confusion. Recollect your friend—the suddenness of the discovery;— we must deal with him very, very gently indeed.
San. I am your slave for ever!—to your direction I submit [225]   implicitly.
Lau. I'll watch my opportunity; and, whatever may be the result, recollect that true lovers' path to happiness is ever 'tangled with briars.
San. While my fate is uncertain, it is impossible to forget it.
                                         [Exit, R. Enter Eugenia and the Admiral , L.;— Admiral lame of the Gout— Eugenia assisting him. Eug. This way if you please, sir; you'll find the walk much smoother here.
Adm. Yes, it's a great deal smoother, and a great deal more level and soft, and I'm very much obliged to you, indeed.
Eug. Obliged to me, sir! Law, sir! not at all, sir; I'm sure it's quite a pleasure to be of any use to such a kind, agreeable, good-natured gentleman as you are.

[Page 14]
Adm. Why you dear, pretty-behaved, engaging rogue— why you don't say so?
Eug. I wouldn't say so if I didn't think so.
Adm. Well, I believe so; and I do protest there's nobody manages me so well as you: there's my son, and my niece, Mrs. Bell, and the family, they are all very kind to me, to be sure; but, when compared to you, my dear, they are so curst awkward.
Eug. Ring for me whenever you want me, sir.
Adm. I will. And you say you are Mrs. Bell's niece, don't you?
Eug. [250]   Yes, sir, just come up from the country.
Adm. Just come up from the country? Well, I declare you look as if you had. And your name's Fanny Bell?
Eug. Yes, sir, Fanny Bell.
Adm. And do you know, Fanny Bell, that I have a great mind to take you all to myself, to charm away the fits of the gout? What d'ye say, Fanny Bell?
Eug. Law, sir, do you think I could do you any good?
Adm. (aside.) I'll be damned if you couldn't. The very sight of you, Fanny Bell, is a restorative. But you are not in your proper place here, depend upon it.
Eug. Not when I'm near you?
Adm. Yes, yes, that's very true. But, Fanny Bell, how could those beautiful, bright brown, sparkling eyes agree with lighting young fellows up to bed—ay, egad, or old ones either?—then, again, those delicate taper fingers—they were never made for brass warming-pans and flat candlesticks;—with the ceremony of lighting up, and showing in, and turning down, and tucking up, and the devil's own cajolery?
Eug. Don't be afraid, sir, I shall wait upon nobody else while you stay here.
Adm. Why, won't you? that's kind; and, to prevent all risks afterwards, suppose I carry you off with me?
Eug. And if you do, sir, put me in the little round-house [275]   belonging to your new villa.
Adm. Put you in the round-house, my dear? Oh! you— What, my observatory?
Eug. Yes; there, sir,— (pointing,) —all among your maps and telescopes: you gave me the key, you know, sir, and I have been setting them all to rights. When you go, you'll find everything in apple-pie order.
Adm. No!—why you're quite a little angel;— (aside) — the wench has certainly taken a fancy to me.
Eug. And afterwards I looked through your little peep-bo-window, and had a beautiful view of the ocean.

[Page 15]
Adm. A view of the ocean! there's a style for a rustic! what a fine natural taste she has! And you are fond of the sea, are you?
Eug. Ah! that I am! To see the waves running mountains high, and the big men-of-war rolling up and down!
Adm. (in rapture.) Ay, and the signal guns firing!
Eug. Frighting the ravens and the sea-gulls, and setting them all screaming over your heads!
Adm. Ay, isn't it inspiring?
Eug. And, then, in calm weather, when it's all so calm and so smooth, and the little boats sailing about, and the waves come gliding so gently upon the beach, as if they had never wrecked a noble ship, but were the most quiet, innocent things in the world—paddle, paddle, paddle!
                                         (Imitating.) Adm. [300]   Ha, ha, ha! Why, you fanciful, fascinating, jade! You shall marry a sailor, and go a sea-voyage with your husband.
Eug. (aside.) That I've done already.
Enter Billy , from Pavilion, unobserved. Bil. (aside.) There she is, entertaining that sea-monster!
Adm. She's a noble wench! and why should not I be the man?— (Aside.)
Eug. (aside.) If he should propose himself!
Bil. What a lovely fair one!
Adm. I'll put her to the proof. You dear, beautiful— (turns upon Billy , who has advanced, and is by this time between them) —What the devil do you want?
Bil. I come to tell you— (glancing at Eugenia , and laying his hand upon his head) —I shall speak presently.
Adm. If you don't, sirrah, I shall—
Bil. Forget the gout, and kick me out.
Adm. What do you want, you odious baboon?
Bil. Your breakfast is waiting.
Adm. Enough! Get out! or I sha'n't be able to swallow a mouthful.
Bil. He's as undelicate as a porpoise. Oh, Miss Fanny!
Eug. Another of my new admirers!
Bil. I wish I was old and gouty.
Adm. Another word, and I—
Bil. I'm going.— (Kisses the hem of her apron.)
Adm. [325]   Insolent!
Bil. I adores the ground she walks upon.
                                         [Exit into Pavilion. Adm. Shall I beg your arm into the Pavilion, my dear?
Eug. Certainly, sir.

[Page 16]
Adm. I'm not always in this crazy condition, Fanny.
Eug. I hope not, sir.
Adm. When I'm free from the gout, I'm quite another man. You wouldn't know me again!—gay, vigorous, full of life and spirits! Do you know, that I have been mistaken for my son? You'll be for keeping your distance then, I promise you!
Eug. Oh! not the more for that, sir.
Adm. Wo'n't you! you pretty, little, tempting— (kisses her hand.)
Enter Charles , L. Cha. Hem!
Adm. Who's that? Eh, Charles! have you arrived?
Cha. Just arrived, sir. Sorry to see you so lame still; the fit seemed so slight, I was in hopes you would have shaken it off before my return, sir.
Adm. No, Charles; it sticks to me. I was just making use of this young creature's arm—
Cha. Yes, and of her hand, too, I observed, sir? Somebody you have hired, I presume?
Adm. Hired! No, sir; she belongs to the house. It's Miss Fanny Bell, sir! the landlady's niece.
Cha. A pleasant, comely wench, faith, sir!
Adm. [350]   Comely wench! None of your impertinent familiarities! they're quite out of place here, take my word for it. This is a respectable young woman; and I desire you will respect her, for her own sake, as well as for your cousin's sake; or, in other words, for your wife's sake.
Cha. By all means, sir. For my wife's sake I will respect her: or, if you please, sir, for your sake.
Adm. Ay, sir, and for my sake! What do you mean by that? Come to breakfast; and none of your undutiful jokes, if you please.
Cha. Allow me, sir?— (Offers to help him.)
Adm. No, sir, I shall not allow you; you are a clumsy fellow; and Fanny shall assist me.— (Takes her arm, and going, turns to R., which brings Eugenia next to Charles , and gives him an opportunity of kissing her hand. Admiral still holding her by the arm, comes round to his former situation.) —Have you seen your cousin yet?
Cha. No, sir.
Adm. No, sir! Then look for her immediately, sir: and tell her breakfast is waiting. You'll find her in the garden: — (Charles crosses to R.) —and, d'ye hear,—now you are come, see that you make her a very attentive lover, and a good husband, when you've the good fortune to marry her.

[Page 17]
Cha. Immediately, sir.
                                         (Kisses Eugenia's hand.) Adm. (turning round.) Why then, go, sir.
Cha. Yes, sir. How I long to jump into her arms!
                                         [Exit, R. Adm. (at door of the pavilion.) Thank ye, Fanny; I'm afraid I shall soon trouble you again?
Eug. [375]   I shall be ready, sir.
Adm. And hark ye,—if that puppy of mine is troublesome—box his ears.
Eug. Never fear, sir! I shall be a match for him.
Adm. I'll be bound you will!—you're a match for anybody. Good morning, Fanny! God bless you, my dear! God bless you!
                                         [Exit into pavilion. Enter Charles , R. Cha. (rushes to Eugenia .) My dear Eugenia.
                                         (Embraces her.) Eug. My dear Charles!
Enter Admiral , from Pavilion, L., and Sandford and Laura , R. Adm. (sees them.) Fanny, my dear!—what the devil's all this?
Eug. (to Charles. ) I wonder at you, sir.
                                         [Exit. L. Lau. (next to Charles .) Why, cousin Charles!
Cha. Oh, my dear Laura! how happy I am to see you!
                                         (Kisses her hand.) Lau. (snatches it away.) Indeed, sir! kissing a chambermaid under my very eyes!—'tis past endurance!
Cha. I see how it is,—I shall drive her to distraction!
Adm. Don't mind him, my dear,— (Crosses to Laura .) — 'tis mere playfulness.
Cha. Not even that, sir! I was merely thanking her a little earnestly for her attention to my father.
Adm. Oh, you are very obliging, sir! but I can thank her for myself,—with your permission.
Cha. However, cousin, you seem to have been engaged as well as myself.
Lau. [400]   This gentleman is a friend of yours.
Cha. What, Sandford!
                                         (Crosses to him.) San. Franklin! I'm glad to see you!
Cha. My dear fellow, I little expected this pleasure!
Adm. We discovered Mr. Sandford to be your friend and school-fellow, and have persuaded him to allow us as much of his company as possible during his stay at Southampton.

[Page 18]
Cha. Then sir, you have acquaintance with a devilish good fellow!
Adm. You ought to thank him, sir, for his attention to your cousin.
Cha. And so I do thank him, sir, with all my heart!— (Aside.) —I wish he'd run away with her!
Lau. (to Sandford. ) He's jealous of you;—he'll never bear it!
Adm. Will you dine with us, Mr. Sandford?
San. With all my heart, sir!
Adm. We shall expect you.
Enter Mrs. Bell , and Waiter , L. Mrs. B. What would you like for dinner, sir?
Adm. Everything of the best, Mrs. Bell. Attend to your cousin, sir.—An't they a delightful couple, Mr. Sandford?
San. Very delightful, indeed, sir.
Adm. Charles is in a pickle,—I own he's in a pickle,—but he adores her.
San. Does he, sir?
Adm. [425]   Loves her to distraction! Can he help it?
San. (aside.) Strange he should be so earnest!
Adm. You'll stay for the wedding?
San. I fear not.
Adm. You must, sir, you must! We shall soon dispatch it; and then, let us get finally settled in my new villa, and all earthly cares will be ended.
                                         [Exit into pavilion. GLEE.

   Old Ocean in sight,
   Once your pride and delight,
Now shelter'd in safety on shore;
   You'll enjoy to the end,
   Like a cherish'd old friend,
But the slave of his humours no more.

   Recounting old stories
   Of Britain's past glories,
You'll heed not which way the wind blows;
   But your children both near you,
   To comfort and cheer you,
You'll hush all your cares to repose.
[Page 19]
SCENE III. —A Room at the Inn. Enter Billy and Susan , R. Bil. Now, what is the use of your persecuting me in this way?—it can't answer no sort of purpose.
Sus. I won't be trifled with, Master William; I want to know what you have got in your head?
Bil. Bless me! nothing.
Sus. No nonsense, sir! you're a-tampering with somebody else—I know it. You're a-thinking of Miss Fanny, that you've gone and put over my head; but do you think I shall put up with it, sir?
Bil. I can't pretend to say.—I shall behave like a man of honour.
Sus. Why will you, Billy?
Bil. Beyond a doubt.—I've taken a liking to Fanny, and it would not be honourable in me not to say so.
Sus. Taking a liking to her! You own it then?
Bil. I adores her!
Sus. And this you call acting honourably. Why, a fortnight ago, you said as how you adored me.
Bil. I can't call to mind no such thing.
Sus. Can't you; but I shall make you call it to mind sir, before I've done with you. Do you think as how you are to chop and change sweethearts like the Grand Turk? Who are you, I wonder?
Bil. I wish you could tell me, Mrs. Susan. I am a young [25]   horphan; we have made out who my mother was, but, for anything you know, my father may be a great nobleman, and it wouldn't be right of me to let down the family.
Sus. Nobleman! a rare fellow for the son of a nobleman! Upon my word, you sentimental chaps have a pretty way of getting out of your rogueries—that's a sure thing. But you have said you'd marry me, before Sally, the kitchen-maid; and lawyer Stike's clerk says, if you won't, I can make you pay for it; so you know what you have got to look to; and if the law won't do me right, he'll move the whole business into a court of iniquity .
                                         [Exit, L. Bil. A court of iniquity!—poor, unfortunate cretur!
                                         (Takes a chair, and reads.) Enter Mrs. Bell , R. Mrs. B. Why, Billy!—where is he loitering? There he is, moppy and muzzy, as usual. Billy! Billy!—what is the matter with you?

[Page 20]
Bil. I don't know what's the matter with me; I'm agitated.
Mrs. B. And what agitates you?
Bil. Ever so many things.
Mrs. B. Let me talk to you, child.
Bil. You talk so movingly.
Mrs. B. Nonsense, child! I want to talk to you about your own concerns.
Bil. My own concerns touches me more nearer than anybody else's.
Mrs. B. [50]   Sir, you must learn to mind your business— earn your livelihood. Recollect yourself: didn't my husband, the late Mr. Bell, take you up, a poor deserted babby , at his door?
Bil. The late Mr. Bell had the bowels of compassion.
Mrs. B. He wasn't rich; but didn't he give you a very decent middling sort of education?
Bil. A very middling education, indeed.
Mrs. B. It ought to have been a good one. Didn't he send you to cousin Luberly, the great Yorkshire grazier, and schoolmaster! You don't mean to asperse cousin Luberly? —you can't complain of his treatment, I'm sure.
Bil. I complains of nothing: I sits like Patience on the monument.
Mrs. B. You were better fed than taught, sir!
Bil. I was, and half-starved into the bargain.
Mrs. B. Not like the poor London lads; you had plenty of air and exercise. Don't you remember how you used to run about among the sheep upon the long common?
Bil. Yes, I remember the long common, and I remember the short commons. Them hills weren't cloth'd with much werder ; it was sharp work, both for the boys and the beasts—we were brothers in adversity. I used to lose myself, ruminating; and when old Luberly called “Billy!” me and the goat didn't know which was which, and so run [75]   a race for the tater parings.
Mrs. B. You're an ungrateful fellow, sir.
Bil. I?—I blesses old Daddy Bell's memory every day of my life.
Mrs. B. Then learn to behave yourself; and, once for all, expect nothing more from me but regular wages as a waiter; and whatever I catch you drinking, I shall deduct it, and so I give you warning.
Bil. I drinks nothing but the dregs of the table-ale, as we call the sour small-beer, and the bottoms of the black bottles arter they're decanted.

[Page 21]
Mrs. B. And do you call that nothing, sir? Rob a poor widow of her thirds, and call it nothing! I'll not hear of it! Mend your manners, and send home your dogs-eared books, and mind your duty! If ever I hear any more of you being either in love or in liquor, you and I shall fall out, depend upon it.
                                         [Exit, R. Bil. What's to become of me? they fills up the cup of my misery, and empties all the others.
SONG.—“Sure Mortal Man.”
Sure mortal man was born to sorrow,
Grief to-day and grief to-morrow;
Here I'm snubbed, and there I'm rated,—
Ne'er was youth so sittivated.
There's Mrs. Bell swears none shall trick her,
And, if I steep my woes in liquor,
[100]   For every drop I take she charges,
And our small ale's as sour as warges,
And our small ale's as sour as warges.
   Oh! Lackaday,
   Pity Billy Lackaday!
Poor Susan scolds, and when I've heard her,
I dream all night of love and murder:
I sighs, I groans, like any paviour,
Forgetting all genteel behaviour.
Miss Fanny, she has quite undone me,
Like any queen looks down upon me,
And when I kneels to ax for mercy,
It does no good—but vice-a-warsay.
   Oh! Lackaday,
   Pity Billy Lackaday!                                          Exit, L. Enter Mrs. Bell , R.; Eugenia , L. Mrs. B. Well, my dear niece!
Eug. My dear Mrs. Bell, everything goes on charmingly; only the worst of it is, he actually makes love to me, and, I verily believe, he is jealous of Charles; however, since he caught him kissing me, he has taken me to his gardens— shown me the summer-house he was so fond of—made me look through his telescope at the ships and prospect— wondered how I came to know so much of geography—and said, if I was old enough, he would like me, of all things, for a housekeeper.
Mrs. B. [125]   Never doubt him!

[Page 22]
Eug. We are very much obliged to you for keeping the secret so close.
Mrs. B. You ought, child: here has been a deal of curiosity about you, I promise you: one tells me he never heard of such a niece before—another, that you must have been brought up to better things—and a third, Mr. Curtis, for instance, advises me to take care of your character, for that all the world is not like Mr. Sandford, his master, and that the admiral has been a sad rake, in his time, to his certain knowledge.
Eug. I warrant him: as he has sent for me again, I'll attend him. Mrs. Bell, keep our secret close, and don't be impatient—in a day or two I hope you may tell it to all the country, as a reward for your most exemplary forbearance.
                                         [Exit, L. Mrs. B. Ay, then I shall tell all about how I knew it all along, and wouldn't utter a syllable, though I could set the whole house a staring and wondering;—how I was thought worthy to be trusted with it;—how I stood all manner of temptation, and kept as faithful as a freeman. So, here comes that gossip, Mr. Curtis, prying and fishing, as he always does.
Enter Curtis , L. Cur. Now, Mrs. Bell, if our bill is ready, we shall have nothing to do but pay it: and then, I am afraid, that you and I must shake hands and part.
Mrs. B. [150]   Part! Mr. Curtis? I'm very sorry for that.
Cur. Mrs. Bell, can you keep a secret?
Mrs. B. Can I! you little think how faithfully—I've such a one in keeping now!
Cur. No!
Mrs. B. Yes!
Cur. Why, then, harkye! There is an affair—
Mrs. B. Is there indeed! Well?
Cur. The Admiral has, you know, a very beautiful niece.
Mrs. B. Yes.
Cur. And my master—
Mrs. B. Yes; your master. I can tell you, your master is a very silly gentleman.
Cur. There, I believe, he does not want your information. But I want to talk to you about a very critical subject.
Mrs. B. A critical subject, Mr. Curtis?
Cur. Yes; an affair of secrecy that concerns myself. I have now lived in this family twenty years, and I think it's high time to retire, and be my own master; in short, Mrs. Bell, to get married and settled.

[Page 23]
Mrs. B. Dear, Mr. Curtis!
Cur. Yes; but there lies a matter on my conscience of which I must first unburthen myself by an honest confession; and you, Mrs. Bell, are the person whom I have selected.
Mrs. B. [175]   For your confession?
Cur. For my confession. When I'm gone, read that letter, and, when I return, answer it.
Mrs. B. A letter!
Cur. Will you comply?
Mrs. B. Certainly.
Cur. Enough! my master's coming.— (Crosses to R.) — Mrs. Bell, may I depend on you?
Mrs. B. Mr. Curtis, faithfully.
                                         [Exeunt Curtis R., Mrs. Bell , L. SCENE IV. —Garden, as in Act I. Enter Admiral , from Pavilion, L.— Susan , L. Sus. Did you send for me, sir?
Adm. For you!—who are you? I sent for Fanny.
Sus. She is busy, sir; she is not in the way, sir. If there's anything you want, I can wait upon you just as well as Miss Fanny. Will your honour give me leave to speak?
Adm. No, I won't. Send me Fanny, and get about your business.
Sus. It's my business to open gentlemen's eyes when they're imposed upon. Miss Fanny's as big a hypocrite as ever slept. But I'm going, sir; only this,—let your young lady look about her. There's pretty goings on,—she's throwing out her lures for your son. Now, mark my words, your honour, and say I said it.
                                         [Exit, R. Adm. Throwing out her lures for my son! Pshaw!— they're all jealous of her. I'll not believe a word of it. Here they come.
Enter Charles, Laura , and Sandford , R. Cha. Well, sir, my cousin has prevailed on Mr. Sandford to stay a day or two longer.
Adm. I'm glad of it—I'm vastly glad of it; he shall come to the wedding dinner; we'll have it before he goes. Zounds! you are always running away from me; I want to talk to the point, and bring matters to a conclusion. I'm for none of your tedious, trifling, shilly-shally courtships, eh?— (Laura comes down between Admiral and Sandford .)
[Page 24]
[25]   —Your day—your day! have you brought her to the day, Charles?
                                         (To Charles .) Cha. Not exactly, sir; but, since you are so very anxious, perhaps if you were to leave us alone for a few minutes, we might come to a final understanding on the subject.
Adm. You're right.—By all means.
Lau. What does he say, uncle?
Adm. He thinks we had better leave you together, in order that you may come to a final understanding, my dear.
Lau. Oh yes; that would be very desirable, certainly.
                                         (Glancing at Sandford .) Adm. I'll manage it. Mr. Sandford?
San. (crosses to Admiral .) Sir?
Adm. We are rather in the way here, it seems; the couple want to talk to themselves; you and I had better slip off, and take no notice.
San. I comprehend.—They have desired you to get me out of the way, then.
Adm. Yes, yes; you understand these matters:—there's no occasion for words; young folks are not all philosophers, like you; therefore, while the turtles are cooing, we'll clear the coast.—Mr. Sandford and I are going to play a hit at backgammon; I suppose you will be able to amuse yourselves?
Cha. We'll do our best, sir.
Adm. Sandford, did you ever see so pretty a picture? Come along, we won't plague the lovers any longer.
                                         [ Exeunt Admiral and Sandford into Pavilion . Lau. (takes a chair and sits.) [50]   Now for it!
Cha. My courage fails me.
Lau. Did you wish to speak to me, cousin?
Cha. Me!—no. Oh! yes—that is—I—. How have you been this long while, cousin?
Lau. Not quite so well as I could wish, cousin.
Cha. Indeed! Ay, the fact is, it is rather a critical moment for us both. This same match they talk of, between you and me,—my father has evidently taken it very strongly to heart.
Lau. To all appearance he has, cousin—very strongly indeed.
Cha. Indeed, his happiness seems to depend upon it; still it's of importance that all parties should be satisfied, as well as himself, cousin.
Lau. Certainly!— (Aside.) —He's taken alarm, that's clear.
Cha. It will be, perhaps, as well to understand each other. You, and you alone, Laura, must decide my destiny.

[Page 25]
Lau. Decide his destiny! poor soul! what an awful— an amorous word was that. What can I say? I have not the heart to kill him.
Cha. You don't answer me. Speak, my dear cousin! it's a very tender, trying subject. I cannot help respecting your happiness; but, at the same time, in a case of this sort, there should be no reserve—mutual taste—mutual feeling; for [75]   however strong it may be on one side, without an entire sympathy on the other, matters of course can't be very promising.
Lau. Far from it, cousin. When you left England, love, I fancy, was pretty much a stranger to us both: but absence is always dangerous.
Cha. The very observation I was going to make to you! you speak, perhaps, from experience. Be candid,—deal honestly with me:—if, by chance, some wayward, unexpected inclination—
Lau. Nay, nay! this is not fair! You have been the rambler; and the question comes most properly from me to you.
Cha. (aside.) She suspects me, it's clear. My dear cousin! I perceive you are uneasy: you don't like to speak your mind. If I am to be the sacrifice, I am ready. I'll endeavour to be resolute—don't keep me in suspense; but speak the word, and let me know the worst.
Lau. No, no! this may be some feint of yours. I am as generous as you Charles: in that article, our sex is superior to yours. If the project of my uncle displeases you—if your fancy has wandered—if, in fact, you would abandon your poor Laura, and wed with another—I'll bear my loss with tender resignation; and never shall reproach of mine disturb you happiness.
Cha. (aside.) [100]   She cuts me to the soul. My dear Laura!
Lau. My dear Charles!
Cha. What a cruel situation!—but it must out—
Lau. What are you muttering?
Cha. My father, you know cousin, had a very dear friend in America—a friend of his infancy—
Lau. I know whom you mean,—Mr. Melbourn.
Cha. The same. I resided at his house, and was considered as one of the family.
Lau. Well!
Cha. The old gentleman had a—
Lau. Had a what?—
Cha. Had a daughter.
Lau. Well!

[Page 26]
Cha. When first I beheld her—I—experienced a—
Lau. A what? what? what?—
Cha. (aside.) I dare not tell her. Oh, what a beautiful country! What a magnificent abode!
Lau. That is not answering the question, cousin:—you spoke of his daughter.
Cha. True! I was going to say—that—his daughter was a—
Lau. Very beautiful creature, no doubt.
Cha. An angel! that's certain. Beauty, grace, and benevolence—
Lau. [125]   Oh, every charm, I have no doubt! Well?
Cha. Her father died in my arms. All her other relations were far away. I beheld her forlorn situation,—without protection, without friends, without experience;—she beheld my tears of compassion and sympathy—you know how susceptible I am?
Lau. I do,—I do. Pray go on!
Cha. I can't—really I can't!
Lau. I guess, traitor,—you fell in love?
Cha. I did, indeed!
Lau. You promised to marry her?
Cha. I not only promised, cousin,—
Lau. But did marry her?
Cha. The murder's out!
Lau. Wretch! The murder is out:—marriage on one hand, and murder on the other. Murder! treason! perjury! Married to another! Barbarian! monster! Oh! oh! oh!
                                         (Sinks into a chair.) Cha. Cousin! Laura! I have struck her to the heart! I have killed her! My dear cousin! My dear cousin! here on my knees let me—
Lau. (rising and bursting into laughter.) Ha! ha! ha! ha!
Cha. What is the meaning? She is delirious! I've driven her crazy! My dear cousin, calm yourself!
Lau. Don't be alarmed, I am.—This is what I did not expect from you, Charles; but I am a great deal better [150]   now—I shall get over it by degrees.
Cha. I dare say you will—
Lau. In spite of your infidelity, sir. I can assure you, what you don't know, perhaps, yourself, that there is still a sympathy—a harmony as it were—in our feelings and fortunes; it's perfectly unaccountable.
Cha. A sympathy in— (aside) —She loves me still, and wants to make me an unfaithful husband.
Lau. Are you not sensible of it, Charles?

[Page 27]
Cha. I must not be sensible of it now, cousin.
Lau. Why, then, I'll explain it to you, Charles. Before you went abroad you knew but little of love, cousin—no more did I:—when you took leave of us, you bore it like a hero—and I endured it like a heroine.—Before you returned, you engaged yourself to another woman—and I engaged myself to another man.
Cha. To another man! Impossible!
Lau. You think so? You conceited, indiscriminating savage! yes, sir, though I was not sufficiently amiable to please you , Mr. Sandford has shown himself a man of taste and discernment.
Cha. Sandford? my old friend! my old school-fellow! I give him joy, with all my heart! the very man I could have wished! You are a sensible girl, cousin—you are perfectly right—he's the man; for he's a solid, steady fellow—a better [175]   fellow than I am, by half—a great conquest!—Here's a discovery!—Oh! my dear Eugenia, how happy this will make you!
Lau. (aside.) Eugenia! I shall love her as much as he does.
Cha. And now, my dear cousin, that we have come to a mutual understanding, as my father, you know, desired us, let us proceed in the same spirit, let us now be frank to each other, free and easy, as we have been; we have now unburthened our hearts, enlightened each other's understanding, set our ideas flowing, and our tongues a going—
Lau. (stopping him.) My dear cousin, your tongue goes. If you please, pray let mine have its share.
Cha. Talk, my dear cousin—you are eloquence itself!— never was I more willing to hear you.
Lau. Be serious. What is to be done with my uncle?
Cha. Ay, that's a damper!—you'll betray us: I know you will!—you can never disguise your feelings—you'll talk, laugh, be full of extacy!
Lau. Not I, indeed! I have too much interest in keeping my own counsel; besides, Sandford is apt to be cross, jealous, distrustful. I must cure him,—tease him a little, to make him value his good fortune afterwards.
Cha. Yes—yes; he's in excellent hands, I'll warrant him!
Lau. And have you no plan to appease my uncle? Can you think of none?
Cha. [200]   Eh! let me see!—I have it!
Lau. Well?
Cha. You shall take it all upon yourself!
Lau. That's very well!—very generous, truly!—you, the arch-rebel, to shift it all upon me!

[Page 28]
Cha. And, if I should have found somebody to relieve us both—a mediating angel who has taken upon herself the task of conciliation, and is now pursuing it?
Lau. Whom can you mean?
Cha. Who, but my dear wife, Eugenia?
Lau. Your wife? Where is she?
Cha. Here,—in this house—you have seen her—spoken to her.
Lau. I see—it comes upon me—as I live, it's Fanny.
Cha. It is Fanny!
Lau. Delightful! I can imagine all—she will succeed! Why, uncle's in love with her himself!—You haven't been jesting with me, Charles?
Enter Billy , from Pavilion, watching. Cha. No, upon my honour! And you?
Lau. No, upon my honour!
Cha. My dear cousin,— (kisses her hand,) —for the first time in my life, I perfectly adore you!
Bil. He perfectly adores her! what a ardour of expression!
Cha. Let us think of securing our mutual happiness.
Bil. Securing their mutual happiness! I ax your pardon—
                                         (Stopping them.) Cha. [225]   Your servant.
Bil. Could you do me a slight favour?
Cha. You are not going to tell your story, I hope?
Bil. Only a curtailed breviation, compressing the particulars.
Cha. Well, sir, we are all attention.
Bil. I am a young fondling !
                                         (Crosses to C.) Lau. A what?
Bil. A young fondling:—I was nursed in tribulation—
Lau. And cradled in calamity?
Bil. No, Miss;—cradled in a hand-basket—and hung up, one summer's morning, at the sign of the Hog in Armour, then kept by the late Mr. Bell.
Lau. Poor innocent! abandoned and exposed—
Bil. No, miss, not exposed; I was nicely packed up in clean straw, with my head peeping out, like a sucking-pig for the parson, and carefully directed to the late Mr. Bell, to be left till called for.
Lau. And could their humanity suggest no other precaution?
Bil. Why, to do them justice, they certainly added, “Carriage paid,” and “keep this side uppermost.”
Lau. And were you never called for?

[Page 29]
Bil. No, miss; except at years of prematurity, when the gentlefolks called for me to wait on them, and glad enough they was to send me off again when I came—sorrow's contiguous. My mother writ a confession of the whole—a [250]   dear deluded creature, of the name of Miss Lucy Lackaday.
Lau. Ha! ha! ha! ha! and your father?—Pray, complete the picture.
Bil. I can't, miss, for he kept in the back-ground, and hain't since been heard of: so, you see, that, belonging to nobody, I wants to have somebody belonging to me.
Cha. You understand, he's in love.
Lau. With whom?
Bil. Such a one! there's nobody comes up to her! you know the head chambermaid?
Cha. What!
Lan. As I live, it's Fanny!
Bil. (in centre.) Bless you! who should it be? Now, if you, young gentleman, as you seem a sort of favourite, would only be kind enough, begging your pardon, to speak a good word for me.
Cha. and Lau. Ha! ha! ha! This is excellent!
Bil. I am very glad you like it; this is vastly genteel, to be sure.
Cha. I admire your taste, of all things!
Lau. He has an excellent instinct, upon my life!— (Crosses to Charles .) —Don't you pity him?
Cha. With all my soul!
Lau. To crown his misfortunes if he was to go and hang himself!
Cha. [275]   Don't overload my conscience, I beg. Poor devil! ha, ha, ha!
                                         [Exit with Laura . R. Bil. Poor devil! go and hang myself! Well, I can't say much for their bringings up, at any rate.
Enter Sandford , L. San. (observing Charles .) They are very merry, that's certain: at whose expense, heaven only knows.
Bil. I have a great mind to follow and affront him. He mistakes his man: underneath this waistcoat is a heart— Holloa! hark ye, mister!
San. And hark you , mister!
Bil. How you startled me!
Enter Eugenia , R. Eug. (observing.) Very merry, indeed! What's the matter, William?

[Page 30]
Bil. Matter enough, miss.
Eug. Who has disturbed you?
Bil. Who? Why, that young gentleman, Mr. Franklin, and his cousin Laura: I couldn't have believed it of them. Let people be as loving together as they like.—but there's no occasion to laugh at other people's misfortunes.
Eug. As loving together?
Bil. Ah! they are a happy pair, that's the truth on't! I was a-walking along, thinking of nothing, but a certain person,—when, who should I stumble on but them two— talking about love and matrimony, and such like agreeable topics, quite pleasant and agreeable,—
San. [300]   Talking of love and matrimony, do you say?
Eug. Well, what followed?
Bil. I'll just mention. They were giving one another all sorts of them melting looks, which a certain person won't understand, if they are ever so tender—
Eug. Say nothing impertinent, sir.
Bil. Impertinent! Now, I'll be judged—
San. Be judged by the devil! go on with your story.
Bil. Don't be violent! I an't a mineral sarvant !
San. Proceed, sir.
Bil. I am a-going to proceed, coolly, and like a gentleman. — (Tenderly to Eugenia .) —Sweet posy of perfection! where was I?
Eug. At melting looks, you know.
Bil. So I was!—and there I could remain for ever and ever!—
Eug. What followed?
Bil. Why, then, Mr. Franklin rushed to her in this manner— (Imitating.) —and took her fair hand, and—may I show you, Fanny?
Eug. Yes, yes!
Bil. He kissed it so!
                                         (Kissing her hand.) Eug. There, there, sir,—he went no further, of course?
Bil. (aside.) I'll fudge.—Yes! and then his hardeur pressed on, and says he, “my dear, dear”—
                                         (Rushing to her.) Eug. [325]   Keep off, sir,—keep off. What did he say, that's all?
Bil. Says he, “my dear cousin, I perfectly adores you!”
Eug. “I perfectly adore you?”
Bil. Them very words.
San. And the lady?
Bil. Took it all as kind as could be, and laughed, bless you, as I never laughed since I was born, nor you neither, sir, it's my belief.

[Page 31]
San. (aside.) 'Tis her pastime to make dupes, and then laugh at them. I'll begone at once, and end my egregious folly.
Eug. What else, sir?
Bil. “And now,” said they, “we understand each other thoroughly, let us think of securing our mutual happiness
San. So, so!
Eug. Incredible!
Bil. Wa'n't it a touching picture?
San. (aside.) A maddening one!
Bil. It's he they call the philosopher. Crazy as you may think it,—if you would only bring about the same for me with Fanny—try me, if it's only for my story!
San. Babbler! I wish it had choked you!
                                         [Exit, L. Eug. I'll not believe it.
                                         (Sits down.) Bil. We are alone: it's a prepitious moment.— (Takes a chair and sits by Eugenia .) —Miss Fanny!
Eug. [350]   Well!
Bil. When the sun's a-setting in the vest , would you just meet me down among the polyantusses ?
Eug. Fool! Fright! I hate the very sight of you!
                                         [Exit, R. Bil. Fool! Fright! With such a pair of dazzlers, that she should see no better than a buzzard!—This won't do. Susan's right—she has got eyes for nobody's beauty but Mr. Charles Franklin's—and if she thinks to carry matters this way—Maybe she has taken a fancy to Mr. Charles Franklin herself—or, maybe, she's playing him off on me, as your beauties do to your true lovers, in a way—Hark! she's returning: it was all her bashfulness! Enter Susan , R. My charming!—Now, what brings you here?
Sus. What! Why didn't I tell you what you would get for your pains, following such a proud thing as that?
Bil. I wish you were half as proud. Can't you cut me as she does?—I shouldn't take it amiss, I assure you.—I thought you was taking the law?
Sus. No, sir; I don't want to do nothing unpleasant—that you know.
Bil. Good soul! then don't intrude upon them as don't intrude upon you.
Sus. Oh! Billy! Billy! ain't you ashamed of yourself?
                                         [Exit with Billy , L.

END OF ACT THE FIRST.

[Page 32]
ACT II. SCENE I. —Same as Act I., Scene I. Enter Curtis , R. Cur. As I suspected, here we are again; my master takes the high road to London, instead of the water's side, and the packet sails without us. He is thrown back upon his plague, and I upon my female confessor. Well, this affair with poor Lucy Lackaday has been long upon my conscience, and now Mrs. Bell can't say I attack her under false colours. Here she comes, with my letter open: what—does she treat it as a joke?
Enter Mrs. Bell , L. Mrs. B. Ha! ha! ha! why, Mr. Curtis, is it you come back? I have read your letter, sir. And so we have found you at last?
Cur. Found me!
Mrs. B. Well! who could have thought it? You the gay deceiver of poor Lucy Lackaday!
Cur. Why, what did you know of her?
Mrs. B. Know of her? why she was poor Mr. Bell's second cousin.
Cur. Lucy Lackaday!—and my boy then—
Mrs. B. Why, is it possible you don't know him, Mr. Curtis?
Cur. How should I, Mrs. Bell? when I returned from my travels with old Mr. Sandford, Lucy had found another husband, and, out of spite, never would give me any news of him.
Mrs. B. [25]   Why, then, I can, Mr. Curtis; you know him as well as I do; you have been messmates and companions; and, if you had but listened to his story, you would have found that it was no other than our poor, dear, comical, Billy.
Cur. What! silly, sentimental Billy?
Mrs. B. We took him up an infant at the door, and he has been here ever since. You'll own him, I hope?
Cur. Own him! what do you take me for?—Certainly; but haven't you owned him, like good souls as you were?

[Page 33]
Mrs. B. Yes; but we spoiled him—you must make a man of him.
Cur. And so I will, for your sake, as well as his own;— we'll do our best. Where is he?
Mrs. B. The admiral has sent for me: wait till I return, and then—
Cur. Only, if you would adopt the father, as you did the son—
Mrs. B. Law! Mr. Curtis! how you talk—do come along.
                                         [Exeunt Mrs. B. and Curtis . Enter Sandford , R. San. Some magic rivets me to the spot: but the power of the self-deceived enchantress is at an end. I'm determined to quit her for ever: here she comes.
Enter Laura , R. Lau. Not gone yet?
San. Unfortunately not, madam!
Lau. Accident, no doubt?—something forgotten—something [50]   left behind you were desirous of recovering?
San. Disgusted with the sophistries of art, I am here enjoying the beauties of nature.
Lau. The beauties of nature! then you wouldn't mind a little bird singing beside you?
                                         ( Sandford sits.) SONG.—“Why are you wandering?”

Why are you wandering here, I pray?
An old man asked a maid one day.
Looking for poppies, so bright and red,
Father, said she, I'm hither led.
Fie! fie! she heard him cry,
Poppies, 'tis known to all who rove,
Grow in the field, and not in the grove—
Grow in the field, and not in the grove.

Tell me again, the old man said,
Why are you loitering here, fair maid?
The nightingale's song, so sweet and clear,
Father, said she, I come to hear.
Fie! fie! she heard him cry,
Nightingales all, so people say,
Warble by night, and not by day—
Warble by night, and not by day.
[Page 34]


The sage looked grave, the maiden shy,
When Lubin jumped o'er the stile hard by;
The sage looked graver, the maid more glum,
Lubin he twiddled his finger and thumb.
[75]   Fie! fie! the old man's cry,
Poppies like these, I own, are rare,
And of such nightingales' songs beware—
And of such nightingales' songs beware. San. Madam, may I be permitted to retire?
Lau. Certainly not; I assure you, Mr. Sandford, you are not in a fit condition to be left alone. Once more, am I to hear your complaints, or am I to congratulate myself on an escape from incurable jealousy and ill-humour?
San. Have you not been trifling with my hopes? Your scene with Charles Franklin, madam,—I know the result of it.
Lau. Indeed, you do not; but you ought to have guessed it, and that would have been quite sufficient.—Here he is. Enter Charles , R. My dear Charles! We are upon good terms, you see: cousins ought to be so. Excuse me, business must be attended to.
San. What am I to think of this?
Lau. Well! my uncle—
Cha. Your uncle's mad. He swears you doat upon me; and if I dare imagine the contrary, says I'm an unprincipled young scoundrel, and he'll disinherit me, and make you amends with my fortune.
Lau. I'm very much obliged to him. But this trifling won't do, Charles; your wife must speak out, or what is to become of poor Sandford?—he'll certainly go mad. Come, [100]   we must about it. Excuse me, Mr. Sandford, remember what I've said to you, and don't go without wishing goodbye—pray don't—that's a good creature!
                                         [Exit Charles and Laura , R. San. The more I pause, the more my embarrassment increases.
                                         [Retires, R. Enter Eugenia , L. Eug. Charles doesn't come to me: how provoking. There's the gentleman Mrs. Bell suspects to be Miss Laura's lover. I may comfort him, at least. Sir!—he won't hear me. Sir!—
San. My dear! did you speak to me?
Eug. Yes, if you please, sir.—You seem to be in trouble.

[Page 35]
San. I'm not quite at ease, child.
Eug. Then take my word for it, Mr. Sandford, you are very much to blame.
San. To blame, Fanny?
Eug. Don't you know what I mean, Mr. Sandford? Oh, every body sees it!
San. Sees what?
Eug. Why, sir, begging your pardon, that you are over head and ears in love with the Admiral's niece, Miss Laura!
San. (aside.) I expose myself to everybody. No, not I, indeed, child!
Eug. (alarmed.) No!
San. No! no!
Eug. Pray don't say so, sir!
San. (aside.) [125]   What is all this?
Eug. Are you quite sure?
San. Why, really my dear, this is—
Eug. Come, come, you're not alarmed at it—what harm is there? I never thought there was any!
San. Sincerity here, at any rate!
Eug. I know a great deal about it, I assure you. It's of no use denying it to me—I can see the symptoms.
San. Well, if you are so infallible, can you prescribe a cure, child?
Eug. In your case, I think I can.
San. Indeed! I shall be glad to hear it.
Eug. Well, then, maybe you're afraid that Miss Laura will marry young Mr. Franklin?
San. (aside.) Disguise is useless here. Well, Fanny, perhaps I am.
Eug. Why, then, I can tell you that she never will.
San. Never will!
Eug. Never, never! And what could possess him to make love to her, except to tantalize her, and you, and his father, and another important person beside, is more than I can imagine.
San. My dear Fanny! how came you acquainted?
Eug. Come, come!—now you want to know everything.
San. To be sure I do.
Eug. [150]   Oh! but you must not. All in good time; have patience; and, above all, press your suit. Miss Laura is a charming young lady, and you mustn't trifle with her; never sit sulky and silent; but tell her, constantly, how much you love her; talk of her beauty, and see nothing of her faults;—that is, open your mouth, shut your eyes, and see what Providence will send you.

[Page 36]
San. My dear Fanny! you interest me almost as much as Miss Laura.
Eug. Oh, for shame, sir! take care.
San. Nay! you won't make mischief between us?
Eug. Me! the most unlikely person in the world.
San. Is there no favoured youth among your admirers?
Eug. How curious you gentlemen are.
                                         (Crosses to R.) San. If there is, Fanny, and I can do anything to facilitate your match—
Eug. You're very good; but if you'll take my advice, and facilitate your own match, I'll answer for mine—thank ye all the same.
San. I wish you all good-fortune.
                                         [Exit R. Enter Charles , R. Cha. He doesn't want both my wives, I hope. Egad! appearances are not flattering to me here, any more than with my cousin. Eugenia! my dear Eugenia!
Eug. Keep your distance, sir, if you please.
Cha. Keep my distance! hang it! it's rather too late in [175]   the day for that, my love.
Eug. And I should have thought it rather late in the day for making love to your cousin; to tell her, for the first time in your life you perfectly adored her.
Cha. And could you find no clue to understand?
Eug. Understand it!—oh, yes! it was pretty intelligible, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself. What! fall on your knees to her! kiss her hand! determined to plot with her, and forget your poor Eugenia!
                                         (Crosses to R.) Cha. Forget you! then must my heart forget its honesty —my eyes the beauty that enslaved it—my ears the melody that enchanted it—and every faculty the source of its best and purest gratification!
Eug. Oh! you can talk finely, when you talk falsely!
Cha. Look at me, Eugenia,—won't you look at me?
Eug. Well! so I do see you.
Cha. And how do I look?
Eug. A great deal more roguishly than I could wish.
Cha. Not like a dissembler, you know; be prepared, then, to hear the truth—we haven't a moment to lose,—the fact is, that awful and delicate interview ended in the most unexpected manner. I told Laura my secret, she rejoiced, and, astonishing as it may appear, hasn't a spark of love for me, but has given her heart, and is determined to give her hand, to Mr. Sandford.
Eug. [200]   Well, now you talk! that's a great deal better than
[Page 37]
all the fine speeches in the world. If your cousin does not love you , then I love her with all my heart.
Cha. I have just left my father: he has embarrassed me more than ever;—“Well, but Charles,” said he, “old Melbourne, where has he settled himself? Did you get no news of him? Does he never mean to come to England? I should like to shake the old fellow by the hand once more!”
Eug. And didn't you speak out then? my father was so good, that if he really loved him, he must love me for his sake.
Cha. He ought, indeed, and still more for your own. But I don't know how it is, I hadn't courage. He's a terrible disciplinarian, and had I broke out suddenly, we must have had a storm, that might have wrecked our hopes and expectations past redemption.
Eug. Don't frighten me, Charles; if I must make the experiment, don't frighten me!
Cha. No, no! we'll prepare him by degrees; Laura's with him now; I'll follow, and sound his humour, adieu!
Eug. Are you going again, so soon?
Cha. Only for a short time. Our fate cries out! Sandford is upon thorns—Laura can't laugh any longer—and I'm like a poet in a manager's ante-room; but even the panic-struck poet might take courage from you, and so will I!
Eug. And when shall we meet again?
Enter Billy , listening, L. Cha. [225]   In an hour, when it's sufficiently dark to be unobserved, and at the usual place.
Eug. Adieu! pray come; I begin to be so afraid of parting with you, Charles—but, if we must—Adieu!
                                         [Exeunt, Charles , R., Eugenia , L. Bil. There's polybigamy! here's a young Blue Beard!— Meet in the garden, will they?—at the old place?—and in the dark, too!—Very well, I'll make one of the party, that they may take their oaths on!—I have, hitherto, been pretty patient under my injuries, now I'll give a loose!—I'll unwhale the mystery!—I'll be revenged on Miss Honeymouth!—I'll make old Boras disinherit his wile hoffspring, and make him a wretched young youth like myself!
                                         [Exit, L.
[Page 38]
SCENE II. —An Apartment at the Inn. Enter Admiral and Mrs. Bell , R. Adm. I'll not hear of it! Postpone the marriage, indeed! He isn't a cold-blooded scoundrel—a heartless, dishonourable villain!—and at the moment, too, when my new villa is just completed, and I intended the wedding for a house-warming!
Mrs. B. (aside.) I shall have the house-warming, now, I am afraid.
Adm. Have I sent him a sea-voyage, to complete his education, for this? What can he mean?—what pretence has he?
Mrs. B. Indeed I can't say, sir.—Perhaps the young lady is not agreeable.
Adm. She not agreeable!—and what right has she to object? Isn't she my niece—my ward? and isn't her fortune at my disposal? and won't she lose half of it if she marries before the age of five-and-twenty, without my consent? Do you fancy that a girl of her spirit has any desire for being an old maid, Mrs. Bell?
Mrs. B. No, that I'm sure she hasn't.
Adm. And what objection can she have to Charles? Isn't he a likely youth—a gallant youth?—but no, confound him! that he does not deserve: but if he isn't, she should have made him so. She has turned the heads of half-a-dozen young fellows, that had no business to fall in love with her; —but, it's no matter; if they dare rebel against my authority, [25]   I'll turn them both upon the wide world, and never see them again, till they come to me, man and wife—ay, and with a proper pledge they love each other as man and wife ought.
Mrs. B. I applaud your resolution, sir.
Adm. I knew you would; but, 'sdeath! the more I think of them the more they enrage me! Where is the coxcomb? I'll follow him; and if he dare resist—
Mrs. B. Now pray, sir, don't—
Adm. I'll take justice into my own hands, and with this good cane—
Enter Billy , L., Hair dishevelled. Bil. I'm distracted—I'm—
                                         (Receives blow.) Adm. How dare you, rascal! What's the matter with you?
Bil. What!—mischief's the matter—mischief and misery! a broken heart, as well as a broken head!

[Page 39]
Adm. Why do you keep this maniac in your house—this madman?
Bil. Enough to make me mad. There's pretty work a going on!—there's wheels within wheels, my noble commander! and it's my duty to let you both into the whole business.
Adm. Me, blockhead?
Bil. Yes; it's a-concerning your son, and your fine lady of a niece.
Adm. What then?
Bil. Why, they are colloquying together.
Adm. [50]   What?
Bil. They are colloquying together; whereby, as I heard them whisper to one another, they are to meet, to-night, in the garden, in the dark, and in the old spot. Now, what do you think of that, my noble commander?
Adm. And you heard all that?
Bil. As plain as I hear you.
Adm. The unprincipled villain! he's corrupting her—I suspected it: and she's a thoughtless, foolish hussey. Send her to me, immediately, in my apartment; I must have some serious conversation with her.
                                         [Exit, R. Mrs. B. Hark you, you fantastical cub, you! there's somebody coming that will bring you to your senses, I warrant you.
                                         [Exit, beckoning on Curtis , R. Enter Curtis , L. Cur. For shame! for shame! what tricks are these?
Bil. Never mind; I shan't wring your old heart long.
Cur. What should vex you?—you have nothing upon your conscience; I wish I could say the same.
Bil. Why can't you?—I pitties you.
Cur. Ah!
Bil. What a hinteresting groan! Let me be your friend and confident. Relieve your old heart; if it's murder, mention it.
Cur. It might have been.
Bil. Might it indeed?—some rash moment—a hamable [75]   weakness—he won't confess—thwarted in your youth, eh?— maybe, you were baulked in your perspiring passion, and turned captain of banditti?— ( Curtis shakes his head.) — He shakes his head—all wrapt in insignificant silence—he's quite a picture. Well, as you won't speak, and, as there seems a sort of sympathy between us, I'll tell you my story. I'm a young fondling —
Cur. Yes, yes; I know—a foundling , you mean.

[Page 40]
Bil. Well, they are both good grammar, you know!
Cur. No matter! I know who you are, and your sorrows are akin to my sins.
Bil. Are they, indeed? First cousins, I dare say?
Cur. But they are now at an end:—prepare yourself for a discovery!—You are an orphan no longer!—I have found a son, and you—
Bil. What?
Cur. A father!
Bil. Where?
Cur. Here! I—I am your father!
Bil. Oh! oh! oh!— (Rushes into his arms.) —Lord bless your old face!—Have I got you at last?
Cur. You have, boy!—Mrs. Bell knows the particulars .
Bil. Oh! blow the particklers ! Don't it always turn out so?—I told you there was a sympathy: and, now I've found you, all my sorrows are at an end; I'll be as lively and [100]   respectful as you, father.—What a nice old cock you are!
Enter Mrs. Bell and Susan , R. Mrs. B. Well, is it all over?
Bil. Over! No; it's just a-beginning!—Here's my father —and, as you 'dopted me for a son, blow me if I don't 'dopt you for my mother!—To her, father!
Cur. (crosses to Mrs. Bell , R.) Bravo! there spoke my son, indeed: come, widow, I have something to back my suit. My old master left me a plumpish legacy.
Bil. Do you hear that?—And, though I'm heir-at-law, I dock my tail with pleasure.
Mrs. B. Oh! you're gay deceivers!
Sus. Billy is, I'm sure!
Cur. And who are you, pray?
Bil. Poor thing! she's got a tender pension for me.
Sus. You promised to marry me, sir.
Cur. How! Did you, sirrah?
Bil. Why, possibly I might; and, since Miss Fanny can't feel my merits, I'd better go to them as can, father—and, as you say, keep a clear conscience.
Cur. By all means, boy; if you have given your word, you shall keep it; and, with Mrs. Bell's permission, we'll pair off together, forget past troubles, and be merry and wise for the future.
                                         [Exeunt, L.
[Page 41]
SCENE III. — Admiral's Apartment.—Centre Doors.—Flat. Enter Admiral , L. Adm. This is a very serious business—a very serious business!—A young profligate!—and yet, I don't wonder at him either—he has it from his father: but the girl must go, I must have her sent back to her country—she makes herself too agreeable for the good and quiet of my family. Why doesn't she obey my summons? Does she presume on my good nature? Enter Eugenia , L. Oh! you are come!
Eug. Yes; you sent for me, sir; and I'm always glad to be near you.
Adm. And why, child? Why are you glad to be near me?
Eug. Why?—why, because I can't help loving you, sir. Excuse my speaking my mind, sir.
Adm. Fie! fie! you're a hypocritical rogue—you love my son, too, don't you?
Eug. O, yes, sir, that I do, indeed.
Adm. Well, you speak your mind plainly, I must confess.
Eug. Ought I not to speak so, sir?
Adm. Undoubtedly! and I hope you'll proceed with equal honesty. Come hither—is it not true my son has just quitted you—that you have been alone together? You blush, I think—answer me.
Eug. Yes, sir,—we have been alone together.
Adm. You are agitated!
Eug. [25]   If I am, sir, I'm sure I don't know why;—I've done no harm.
Adm. That I'm sure you haven't.— (Aside.) —Her heart's gone, that's plain. And what did he say?
Eug. Some very kind things, indeed, sir—full of tenderness and affection—and so he said he should always feel for me: that I had done right to come here and live with my aunt: and that he would do all in his power to make my life agreeable.
Adm. My old language to a letter. I must protect her, but go she must; and yet, I dare say, I shall make her wretched! Pshaw! this is weakness and trifling: mine are habits of authority and command. I must be myself.— (Loud and stern.) —Come hither, girl!
Eug. (startled.) Oh! dear, sir! pray don't speak so to
[Page 42]
me, after being so kind! I can't bear to hear you speak so harshly—indeed I can't!
Adm. (aside.) This will never do. Very well, I don't mean to speak harshly to you, but I have strong reasons, girl!
Eug. And that word again—you called me your child just now—it was a much kinder name: why should you change it?
Adm. Pooh! pooh! child ! since you will have it so. No more of this—I'm not used to be trifled with—I want to know whether you think of staying in this neighbourhood?
Eug. [50]   O, yes, sir, I hope so! I have taken a long leave of my country; and where could I be so happy, as near you, sir. You talked of having me in your house: it would be my heart's joy, if you would, sir!
Adm. Ay, ay, you've a wrong motive for that, child; and you mustn't think of it. Have you no regret at leaving your country? I'm for seeing you married, child!—is there no young favourite left behind?
Eug. Oh, no, sir! Since I lost my father, I have no friend left there, sir! Here, I may find others; and, since you are good enough to wish me a husband, he must be of this part of the world, if you please, sir! Why should I not be near you, sir, and do you all the service I can—I should be as careful of your comfort and happiness, as if you were my own father.
Adm. (aside.) She has me. A bosom of adamant could not stand against her.—Wait a moment.—Yet all this, instead of shaking my resolution, ought to strengthen it.— ( Mrs. Bell is seen at door in flat.) —Here comes her aunt, with her I may be more courageous.
Eug. There's my aunt, sir, she'll tell you.
Adm. Come in, Mrs. Bell,—come this way. Enter Mrs. Bell . Fanny, you may retire.
Eug. Are you angry still, sir?
Adm. No, no, I'm not angry,—but get you gone.
Eug. [75]   I tremble—what has happened? The more I know him, the more I love him, and dread his displeasure.
                                         [Exit, L. Adm. This girl must go—she can't stay in my neighbourhood,—hear what I say, and make no reply.
Mrs. B. Oh! dear sir, no; you may depend—
Adm. Silence! this purse contains a hundred guineas— take it—I mean it as a portion for your niece—she's a good girl, and see that she has a good husband; but, if you value my patronage and protection, she must leave this place immediately!

[Page 43]
Mrs. B. Leave us?
Adm. Not a word! 'tis my desire—comply with it! You know the consequence—this very night she must go!
Mrs. B. Dear me! so much as I love her!
Adm. Hark'e! I love her as much as you do, and am as sorry to lose sight of her. I have my reasons —don't vex me by asking them—leave me, and obey!
Mrs. B. (aside.) Dear young lady, what will she say to this?
                                         [Exit, L. Adm. That business is settled. I have overcome every lurking weakness, and secured the repose of my family. The girl has turned my wits, as well as my son's, and almost made us rivals in the heart of a chambermaid.
Enter Charles, Laura , and Sandford , R. Adm. Well, young gentleman, and you, madam, what crotchet has crept into your heads?—Have you made up [100]   your minds?
Cha. Sir, if—
Adm. No ifs, puppy! The solicitor's clerk is in the house with the marriage articles; I know your secret, sir, and poor Laura is too proud to resent the change it has produced in you, though I dare say her heart is bursting with rage and mortification.— (Crosses to Laura , R.) —But, calm your feelings, and be comforted—he shall marry you, and, what's more, damme, he shall love you too, or the whole Consistory Court, Doctors, and Proctors, shall be employed to make him.
Lau. Dear uncle, pray don't force him, for, as matters stand, I assure you, the marriage is quite impossible.
Adm. Impossible! What do you mean?
Eug. (without, L.) Let me pass—I will speak to him!
Adm. Again!
Lau. What wild step is this?
Cha. Listen!
Enter Eugenia , L., crosses to Admiral . Eug. Oh, sir! have I heard rightly—is it you that have given these orders, that cut me to the heart?—You, so good and so generous, that have taken such pains to make me love you, and then banish me for so doing?—But I'll not go!—Oh! never, never! I must be ever near you— ever look up to you as a friend, a protector, a father!
Adm. This is more than I can bear—Leave me, child!
Cha. [125]   Listen to her, sir.
Adm. Peace! libertine! I have heard too much!

[Page 44]
Eug. I know the cause of your displeasure—suspicion pursues me, with some reason—I approach you in a character which is not my own, but for no dishonest purpose;—I am neither low-born nor indigent. You had an early friend, who has long lived in a distant country, his name was—
Adm. Melbourn?
Eug. Yes, sir!
Adm. I loved him as a brother!—Jack Melbourn—we were class-fellows, boon and bottle friends, and rubbed away the bloom of life together.—We were of impetuous spirits, and a trifle divided us:—a word, aggravated by the mischief-makers of this meddling world:—but I have loved him ever—God bless him!
Eug. If you loved the father you will not reject his child.
                                         (Kneels.) Adm. You the daughter of Jack Melbourne! Where— where is he?
Eug. Where he no longer feels the bitterness of poisoned friendship.
Adm. Dead?
Eug. Alas, yes!—but he bequeathed to you an affection unaltered as your own. A friend was at his bedside with him: he charged me to come hither. “I leave you,” said [150]   he, “my child, but not an orphan. I know the heart of my old friend; minister my last blessing to him, and you will still have a father. I die in peace, for I already see you in his arms!”
                                         (Embrace. Adm. Let him look down and see you there now! Your father was right; I thank him that he did me justice. My heart was your's at once—the surviving spirit of my old friend was the unconscious charm: now I recognize it in every look and feature.
Eug. Indeed, sir!
Cha. All's safe now, I hope.
Adm. But, 'sdeath! why do I see you descend to this masquerade?
Eug. Oh! that's another matter, sir; you know you recommended me to find a lover?
Adm. A superfluous injunction; I dare say you had one.
Eug. I had;—the friend who attended my dying father; but his family—
Adm. His family! what family could oppose such a choice?
Eug. They had other prospects.
Adm. They shall renounce them then! Who are they? I'll talk to them—I'll take it all upon myself. Let them dare insult your feelings in my presence! Who is the
[Page 45]
youth?—'sdeath! were I in his place, to-morrow I'd make you Mrs. Franklin—eh, sir!
                                         (To Charles.) Cha. [175]   Certainly. I'm so decidedly of your way of thinking, that, having met the young lady in my travels, I have made her Mrs. Franklin already!
Adm. You!
Cha. and Eug. (kneeling.) Your blessing, sir!
Adm. You scoundrel! (Embraces Eugenia .) You dear angel! How dare you, sir, to marry a ward of mine, without my consent?
Cha. Wouldn't you have done the same, sir?
Adm. I'll be damned if I wouldn't! Your wife's a prodigy, for she's the first that ever made me forget character and wink at an act of mutiny.
Eug. We'll be very obedient for the future, sir!
Adm. Obedient! As you've served your time before the mast, why I'll lay up, and you shall be commander-in-chief.
                                         (Joining hands.) Lau. (coming down.) And what's to become of me, sir?
Adm. Why, that's rather a puzzling question; 'tis a bit of a balk, to be sure; but we'll look out for a substitute.
San. If, sir, I might venture to offer myself.—
Adm. You're very accommodating! upon my soul, I'm very much obliged! (To Laura .) What am I to answer?
Lau. Whatever you think proper, sir.
Adm. Whatever I—Why, you barefaced baggage! so you've been plotting against me, too! You're all alike. Well, well! I see Fortune has provided better for me than [200]   I could do for myself; for, instead of making me the father of two, she has made me a father of four.
San. And who's to father these four?
Enter Susan, Billy, Mrs. Bell , and Curtis . Bil. I come to introduce—
Adm. Whom, cub?
Bil. The two Mr. and Mrs. Curtises, to your favour.
Adm. Two Mr. and Mrs. Curtises?—Booby what do you mean?
Bil. Why, genteelly speaking, we're leading one another to the halter.
Adm. What for?
Bil. To change our predomination.
Adm. What, Mrs. Bell! another husband?
Mrs. B. This is the last time of asking.
Adm. Well, I shall have turtles enough to stock my pigeon-house, at any rate. And when we have our wedding-dinner,
[Page 46]
charge me with yours. We'll have a royal salute,—and you, sir,— (to Curtis ,) —shall serve out a jorum of punch to every blue-jacket in the harbour, to drink the good old seaman's toast of—“ Sweethearts and Wives .”

Main text ACT I. Scene Scene .—The Farm-yard of Oberto—the house, R.—an outhouse, ornamented with creeping plants, built against another building of the farm, L.—at the bottom of the yard, a small river from R. 3 E. to L. U. E., over which is a rustic bridge from R. 4 E. to L. 3. E., in very bad repair; steps to descend, L. C; in the distance, a rural view—on a stand, under a window, near the door of the house, R., are some flower-pots—a rustic seat under the window of the outhouse—chairs and a small table—curtain rises to soft music, expressive of the harmony of a fine summer morn. Enter Elvina , from the house, R., with a small watering-pot, which she puts down, examines the flowers under the window, and takes away one of them. Elvina. These flowers already begin to fade; while Edmond is away, I will replace them with some which are but newly blown. (Music—she brings a pot from the house in the place of the one she takes away) Alas! Edmond cannot see their varied tints, but the sweet perfume of these fresh flowers will assure him that Elvina ceases not to think of him ( Molino sings without, L.) Here comes that foolish fellow, Molino.
Enter Molino , L., with a whip. Molino. (L. C.) Ah! there's my pretty neighbour—alone, too. Wounds! if I could but muster up courage enough to— hem! hem! before I make my approaches, I'll make a commence with some pretty genteel sort of compliment. Now I have it—these flowers are beautiful—you are beautiful—and seeing you together, a body may say—how do you do to-day, Miss Elvina?
Elvina. (R. C.) Very well, thank you, Molino; but what a fine compliment you pay me!
Molino. Odsbobs, miss! I haven't my words at my fingers'
[Page 4]
ends, as you have, who were so long at the grand 'cademy there at Warsaw; but that's neither here nor there. When the heart—though I say it—is my neighbour, Oberto, at home?
Elvina. My father? No, he went out at sunrise to look after the reapers in the field, near the wood.
Molino. And where's the young blind boy? Is he still in the arms of Orpheus, as our schoolmasters say?
Elvina. [25]   Edmond is with my father.
Molino. Ha, ha! what business, now, can he have there, I wonder? Poor lad! it's all the same to him, whether in the open fields, or at the bottom of a well.
Elvina. There, Molino, you are mistaken: though his eyes are not blessed with the brilliant light of day, his other senses more exquisitely feel the soft impression of the sun's first beams, and the fresh morning breeze, which breathes its fragrance around him. Even now, seated on a bank, near my father and his men, he sees them not, 'tis true—but he hears their cheerful song, their joyous tales, and my dear Edmond is happy.
Molino. I believe he is, indeed! I don't doubt he is happy, since he is your dear Edmond.
Elvina. Does that displease you?
Molino. Oh, no matter; it's not worth mentioning; but just let's talk a bit of reason. My papa, Molino, and your papa, Oberto, seeing us play together, used to say, “dang it! they be pretty poppets—they'll make a nice match some day or other.” “What say you to it, neighbour Oberto?” says my father. “Why, dang it, neighbour Molino, I see nothing to contrary it.” So they shook hands, and 'twas a done bargain. Don't you think 'twas, now?
Elvina. I should suppose they thought the marriage would be agreeable to both.
Molino. [50]   That's exactly what I always reckoned upon. You haven't forgot all that has happened since, 'twixt you and I?
Elvina. Happened since! Indeed, I do not understand you. Why, what has happened?
Molino. That's a good one! You ask that? Why, who bought you all the pretty ballads? Who gave you the largest and prettiest nosegays at the fairs? And then, at blind-man's buff, who always caught you, and made believe not to know you, on purpose that he might hold you longer in his arms? Eh! what happened, indeed!
Elvina. Indeed, Molino, I cannot see what this proves.
Molino. No? But I see how it is; you'd rather play blindman's buff with Edmond.
Elvina. Softly, Molino! it is unkind of you to mock at the poor youth's misfortune.

[Page 5]
Molino. You love him very much, then?
Elvina. He is my dearest friend, and he loves me, I believe, better than all the world.
Molino. Very well! mighty well! He loves you, you love him; but still, I flatter myself, I have as proper a leg as another, and what's more— (music, piano)
Elvina. (looking towards R. U. E.) Ah! I see my father coming towards the bridge. (runs to him)
Enter Oberto , over the bridge, from R. to L. U. E.—Music expressive of joy. Oberto. (C.) Why, Elvina, my child, surely the bridge has given way since I passed it this morning?
Elvina. (L.) [75]   Yes; part of it gave way just as the waggon had got over; (music) but, my dear father—what! Edmond not with you! If in your absence he should return—
Oberto. Don't be uneasy, my dear—I left him with the reapers.
Molino. (R.) Never fear, miss; if he has a mind to come alone, he'll find his way safe enough. I've often laughed to see how he clears the posts, bushes, and cart-ruts. Egad! one would think he had an eye at the end of his walking-stick.
Elvina. Silence, Molino, I desire yon.
Oberto. What, angry with Molino?
Molino. I thinks, I have the most cause to be angry. She says she doesn't love me. I gave her proofs of it just now, and I'll continue to make love to her, and torment her to such a pitch, that she must have me at last, if it is only to get rid of me. (going)
Oberto. That's right, neighbour; but, pray, are you not going to Warsaw?
Molino. To be sure I am! Talking of that, you had better take advantage of my car. Gad! you should go to the city now or never.
Oberto. Why so?
Molino. What! don't you know that all Warsaw will be turned topsy-turvy to-morrow. There'll be such fetes, feasting, and fiddling! and all to celebrate the marriage of Prince [100]   Rodolph, the son of our good King Stanislaus, with the Princess Lida, Grand Duchess of Lithuania. Oh! 'twill be a capital sight! Come go with me in the car; Miss Elvina will sit very easy in it—there will be room for Edmond, too. Yes, miss, I knows very well you would have no pleasure without him. Poor lad! he'll not often find himself at such a grand to do. Such rich dresses! such illuminations! such—
Oberto. All these would not be very interesting to Edmond.

[Page 6]
Elvina. My good friend, we thank you; pleasures of this kind we do not covet.
Molino. You'll have a very great loss; for my part I love a jolly row and a good squeeze.
                                         Exit, L. Oberto. Elvina, do you not love Molino?
Elvina. As the companion of my childhood, father; no more.
Oberto. And you would not marry him?
Elvina. I marry him! Oh, father, if I should marry—If I should leave this house, who would supply my place near Edmond? Who would lead him about? Who would he have to listen to his artless tales?—to lament with him?—to pity and console him?
Oberto. Who would? Why, I would.
Elvina. I know you love him as your son; but—indeed, father, you could not be always with him. Besides, you know not the little cares, the delicate attentions, with which [125]   nature inspires our sex, and which are more a pleasure than a duty to us. And if I could be cruel enough to deprive him of them, even for a single day, indeed, indeed, poor youth, I'm sure 'twould kill him. (weeps)
Oberto. (wipes his eyes) Yes, yes, girl, you are right—you ought not to think of marriage yet. But, my child, what Molino has just said about Edmond—can he have guessed right?
Elvina. (timidly) Oh, no! 'tis a little jealousy, that's all.
Oberto. Come, Elvina, speak frankly to your father, to your friend; have you ever wished to marry Edmond?
Elvina. My dear father, I never once had such a thought; but I will confess to you, if you should order me to make a choice, 'tis he that I should name to you.
Oberto. (crossing, R., reflecting) Hum! if it was to come to that.
Elvina. But it is not come to that, father.
Oberto (still reflecting) Eh! perhaps, if you did not think of it, I have a long time considered of it. One difficulty alone prevents it.
Elvina. (with anxiety) What is that, father?
Oberto. I am fearful lest, one day, we should discover that Edmond's birth is far above ours.
Elvina. What foundation have you for such a surmise?
Oberto. Listen, and you shall hear. (they sit— Oberto , R. C., Elvina , C.) [150]   I had been a soldier fifteen years when I married your mother. We had retired to a village near Gesna, and we lived there poor and miserably enough. One fine day we were sitting at our cottage door. You were then three years old, and playing near us, when a stranger arrived, followed by a
[Page 7]
woman who held an infant in her arms. He stopped and examined us attentively. You left your play, and ran to the woman, to let you kiss the child. The stranger observed you, and advanced to us,—“My honest fellow,” says he, “here is a purse contains five hundred pieces of gold—it is for him who will take charge of this child. Speak, will you have the infant and purse?” My wife and I looked at each other, when you cried, “Yes, papa, do take it, do take the little baby, it's so pretty.” We accepted the proposal, but the stranger added one condition to it, that we should directly quit the village, and remove at least thirty leagues from Gesna. We took the child—
Elvina. 'Twas Edmond.
Oberto. And soon discovered he was blind. Our arrangements were soon made. We quitted Gesna, and settled in this village, four leagues from Warsaw, where, with the money which the purse contained, we bought this farm. My industry has made it prosper, and but for your mother's death— (they rise)
Elvina. Oh, don't speak of that, dear father.
Oberto. At that time Gesna was the residence of our [175]   sovereign. 'Twas not till some years after, that Stanislaus preferred Warsaw. Our being required to remove from the vicinity of the court, and the large sum which the purse contained, have often led me to suspect that Edmond might be the child of some great lord of the court, who, for weighty reasons, was compelled to make use of this cruel precaution. You see, then, child, we should consider well before we determine on a marriage.
Enter Edmond , R. U. E., advancing towards the bridge, feeling with his stick.—Music, expressive of fear. Elvina. (sees him on the bridge, with dread) Oh, heavens!
Oberto. (calling) Take care, Edmond—take care—you—
Elvina. (placing her hand on her father's mouth) Silence, father! if you startle him, he'll fall. You're very safe, Edmond, but don't stir—wait for me. (she runs to Edmond , takes him by the hand, assists him over the bridge, leads him to the seat under the window, and sits by him, R.—music, expressive of affection— Oberto places a chair near the table, L.—he goes in the outhouse, and returns with a book, pen, and ink, and seats himself at the table, L.) My dear Edmond, how could you pass this dangerous bridge alone? Part of it has fallen in since the morning, and the rest scarce holds together.
Edmond. I waited for you in the corn field, my dear Elvina, you came not, and I was weary of being so long absent from you. Hark! Elvina, don't you hear the sound of the horn?

[Page 8]
Elvina. (after a pause) No, I hear nothing. (goes up to listen)
Edmond. There is certainly some one hunting in the forest! There again! the huntsman's call distinctly.
Elvina. (listening) I cannot hear it.
Oberto. (who has been listening) Nor I, either—surely you are mistaken, Edmond.
Edmond. [200]   No, father, listen—there again—the sound is louder; they come this way. (horn)
                                         ( Elvina and her father listen attentively—the sound of a horn is heard at a great distance) Elvina. Edmond is right, father.
Oberto. Yes, yes, very true. How fine his sense of hearing! (horn sounds again) I can scarcely hear it now, though it's so much nearer.
Elvina. Perhaps 'tis the Prince Rodolph hunting.
Oberto. Prince Rodolph! No, he has other game to hunt. He is to be married to-morrow.
Elvina. I forgot; it can't be him.
Edmond. I pity the lady who marries him, with all my heart; they say he's a most wicked young prince. He, like me, had the misfortune to be born blind; but Providence heard his parents' prayers, and restored his sight, while I alas! am left without sight or parents. ( Edmond weeps, turns towards window, stretches out one hand, and places the other on his heart—soft music, expressive of love) Where are you, Elvina?
Elvina. (goes to him quickly) Here I am, Edmond.
Edmond. Dear Elvina, thank you.
Elvina. What for, my Edmond?
Edmond. For having ornamented my window with fresh flowers, Elvina?
Elvina. What, can you perceive it already?
Edmond. None of the attentions you lavish on me can ever escape my observation. Ah! Elvina! if you knew how [225]   sensible I am to them! I have often heard that you were handsome; but I know not how the sight of you could increase the sentiment you inspire me with; to be near my Elvina, to hear her voice, to feel her hand in mine, is the summit of my happiness. 'Tis not the privation of an enjoyment I have no idea of, which makes me grieve at my misfortune, but I lament to feel the obligations I am under, without a possibility of returning them.
Elvina. You love us, Edmond—that is an ample recompense.
Oberto. If you knew, Edmond, what Elvina said just now, talking of you—

[Page 9]
Elvina. Father! (low to her father, putting her finger to her lip)
Edmond. Why forbid your father to go on, Elvina?
Oberto. How! did you hear her, then? Egad! for my part, child, I think he hears the slightest motion.
Edmond. Go on, father; what did she say? Pray tell me!
Oberto. Can't you guess? Much about the same that you say to me whenever she is absent.
Edmond. Ah, my Elvina. (a horn is heard nearer)
Oberto. The hunters come this way.
Enter Molino , L., he runs on bridge to look out. Molino. Neighbour, neighbour, come and see, come and see! The hunters are coming out of the wood, and seem to take this way.
Oberto. Well, let them come.
Molino. (advancing) Don't you know who it is? They say [250]   'tis the Prince Rodolph, son to King Stanislaus.
Oberto. Oh, if it's he—
Molino. This prince, by gum! he must be main fond of the chase, to be hunting so far from home, the day before he is to be married. (from the bridge) There! there! 'tis a wild boar they have killed. Lud, lud! how angry he is at it! Quick! quick! Come and see, Elvina! Come and see, Edmond!
Edmond. (smiling) I thank you, Molino.
Oberto. The silly fool!
Molino. Oh! I must, I must see the Prince Rodolph—that I must! (on the bridge) There, they are close by—there, they dismount! I'faith, neighbours, they are coming straight this way. Perhaps you see them?
Oberto. The devil! I wish they'd take some other road.
Music— Officers, Huntsmen , &c., arrive on the other side, R. of bridge— Rodolph, Starow, Kalig and Suite , pass the bridge, from R. to L., and descend by the slope, L.—Music, horns, &c. Rodolph. Are you the master of the farm?
Oberto. (R.) I am, your highness.
Rodolph. Well, my friend, you'll oblige me much by getting us some refreshment. The chase was long. I feel thirsty.
Oberto. With the greatest pleasure, your highness. (to Elvina ) Go, my child, call Frank and his comrade—they will help you.                                          Exit Elvina into house, R. Would your highness please to sit here, or go into the large hall?

[Page 10]
Rodolph. We shall be very well here. (sits at a small table, L.) You have been a soldier, or I'm mistaken?
Oberto. [275]   Yes, my prince; I served fourteen years and I hope with honour in the legion of Plosko.
Rodolph. Your name?
Oberto. Oberto—at your service, prince.
Kalig. (L., aside) Oberto! (he looks around, sees Edmond , and examines him attentively)
Enter Elvina , R., with a small jug and goblets, which she places on table, L.—Music. Rodolph. Thank you, fair maid. (to Oberto ) Your daughter, I presume?
Oberto. Yes, your highness.
Rodolph. A fine girl!
Edmond. (apart, to Elvina ) Come, Elvina, let us begone.
Elvina. With all my heart.
                                         Elvina takes his arm, and leads him to the door of the house, R., but stops to let two Servants pass who enter with large jugs— Oberto signs to them to help the Hunters and attendants. Molino. (aside looking at Rodolph ) Zounds! the prince does drink just like another man, I declare.
Kalig. (taking Molino aside to R., with great agitation) Is the young man who just left us, blind?
Molino. Oh, yes, that he is, and of both eyes, too.
Kalig. Is he son to this farmer?
Molino. No; but all as one.
Kalig. Um! um! (aside considering) Oh, should this be him I seek! (goes up C.)
Rodolph. (rising) Starow, my friend, e'en the pleasures of the chase afforded me no relief.
Starow. (L. C.) Cheerly, my prince! 'Tis the fatigue of this long day's chase depresses you.
Rodolph. No, Starow, no; 'tis not the body now complains, [300]   it is the mind disordered that weighs me down.
Starow. Consider, sir, Lithuania's charming duchess soon will grace your bed. Her smiles will chase away intruding melancholy.
Rodolph. Never, never! Oh, Starow, there is a being breathes this air, whose existence is poison to my happiness.
Starow. (half draws his dagger) My prince, shall I—
Rodolph. Officious fool! Think'st thou, if I could find this enemy to my repose, I should want thy feeble aid? No more! Starow, give orders to depart. ( Starow turns towards the Suite—they advance—he gives his orders to depart— Oberto
[Page 11]
approaches the Prince and bows) And there, my honest friend. (presenting a purse to Oberto )
Oberto. Your highness, I hope, will not wound an old soldier's feelings, by offering payment for so slight a service.
Rodolph. (taking his hand) Well, my brave fellow, I shall not forget your generous hospitality. Away.
                                         Music—Exit Rodolph and Starow , over the bridge to R., followed by Hunters—Kalig remains— Molino follows with the Peasants , to see the Prince , L.— Kalig , after being assured that they are gone, approaches Oberto , and looks at him attentively. Kalig. Are we alone?
Oberto. Why do you ask?
Kalig. I would speak with you.
Oberto. (astonished) Ha! (looks through the door, R., and then returns) Speak on.
Kalig. Your name, I think, is Oberto?
Oberto. It is.
Kalig. You lived in another village before this?
Oberto. I did; at Urzena, six leagues from Gesna; but it's a long time back.
Kalig. (L. C.) [325]   'Twas there that a blind infant was given to your charge?
Oberto. (R. C.) (uneasy) What say you?
Kalig. Is that child still living?
Oberto. Thanks be to heaven, yes! you saw him, as you came in; he was with my daughter.
Kalig. Yes, I saw him then.
Oberto. Ah, sir, for pity's sake, tell me who were his parents?
Kalig. I am simply charged with a commission to you. For more than two years, I have made every search for you, but in vain. (takes a parchment from his bosom) This writing I have always carried about me, in the hope that chance might one day bring us together. It was to be given to you, in case the child entrusted to your care was living. The condition exists; then take the writing,—it is addressed to you. (offers him the packet)
Oberto. (taking it hesitatingly) To me! Addressed to me! (looks at the seal) Ha! the seal—
Kalig. Of our late queen.
Oberto. The queen! (his hand trembles—the packet falls— Kalig takes it up, and gives it to him)
Enter Elvina , from the house, R. Elvina. Father, breakfast is ready, we wait for you.

[Page 12]
Oberto. (confused and endeavouring to hide the packet from her) Very well, very well—I'm not hungry—go in, go in.
Elvina. (astonished) What ails you, father? You seem uneasy—this stranger—
Oberto. I'm busy. I tell you again, go in.
Elvina. (in tears) [350]   Never did you treat me so before, father!
Oberto. I treat you ill! (embracing her) Go in, my love— go in, I beg of you.                                          He conducts her with affection to the door—Exit Elvina , into the house, R., looking anxiously at her Father and Kalig . Pardon me; now proceed. (returning)
Kalig. Then there—I have but one injunction more; it is to bid you read that packet without witnesses. Fare you well, Oberto.
Oberto. Wait a moment. At least, I may read it before you.
Kalig. No; I must follow instantly to prevent suspicion. But, remember, if you have occasion to make a journey to Warsaw, beware of Prince Rodolph. My name is Kalig— remember it, Oberto! Seek me out, and at the hazard of my life, I will serve you.
                                         Music—Exit over the bridge, to R. Oberto. (remains almost motionless) My hand trembles! I dare not break the seal—let me breathe awhile! Oh, my dear Edmond, it is your fate which I am about to discover, and 'tis the Queen that—Courage, Oberto! a soldier and afraid!
                                         Music, expressive of violent agitation—he breaks the seal eagerly—a pause—unfolds the packet, turns it in various directions, rubs his eyes, wipes his forehead, and at last reads—as he reads his surprise and emotion increases— he exhibits the most violent agitation. Oberto. Edmond, the son of Stanislaus! heir to the throne of Sarmatia! (Music, expressive of his agitation) But let me finish— (endeavours to read) there is a mist before my eyes—I can't see a letter! What, my Edmond—my dear boy, my prince? (soft Music—his eyes fill with tears—he wipes them) Come, come—I must be calm. (Music—walks about in great agitation, with hasty strides) What! the Prince Rodolph is no longer—Ha! this is no trifling matter.
                                         (walks about as before—Music) Enter Molino over bridge, running from R. Molino. [375]   Any commands for Warsaw? I'm just going.
Oberto. (without heeding him) Oberto, the fate of Warsaw, of the whole empire of Sarmatia, is this day in your hands. If you are silent, all remains; if you speak, all is changed. Say but a word—the truth comes out, and the crown—
Molino. (approaching him) Eh! what's that you say neighbour?

[Page 13]
Oberto. (anxiously) Were you listening?
Molino. (L.) I just came this moment, to tell you our car is ready, and to ask if you have any commissions. But what the deuce were you talking about, neighbour? the crown and Warsaw! 'Tis my belief that you were dreaming, with your eyes open.
Oberto. Yes, yes; I—Did you never dream that you were some rich powerful great lord?
Molino. Oh, yes—yes; I often dreamed that I was become rich—very rich; and that I was going to town to sell our provisions in a coach and six; but, for all that, when I waked I was only Molino.
Oberto. (aside) He has not heard me. Well, neighbour, I'm much obliged to you, but I have nothing to trouble you with. You must excuse me—but I have a good deal to do.
Molino. Good bye, neighbour. (going, L.)
Oberto. (calling him back) Ah, Molino! (aside) We may take advantage of this opportunity. Can't you delay your [400]   departure for a few minutes?
Molino. Oh, yes—certainly.
Oberto. Perhaps we may be inclined to go with you.
Molino. Gadzooks! will you? That will be mighty agreeable.
Oberto. Well, my friend, return in a quarter of an hour, and we'll be ready for you.
Molino. I'll just go and put on the head of the car, and make everything snug for Miss Elvina.
Oberto. And for Edmond, too.
Molino. Edmond!
Oberto. Yes, yes—Edmond. If he don't go—
Molino. Well, well—we'll take care of him too. (aside) There, there! neither father nor daughter can think of anything but Edmond.
                                         Runs off, L. Oberto. I must go find my children. Enter Elvina , R., meeting her Father at the door. Oh, Elvina—great news! Such news, my girl! call Edmond to me.
Elvina. (R.) Great news! You frighten me, father.
Oberto. (L.) The news is good—very good. Call Edmond, I tell you.
Elvina. Here he is.
Enter Edmond , R.— Elvina , leads him forward. Oberto. (R., runs to embrace him) My dear Edmond!—I forgot. (falls on his knees) Oh! my prince, permit me to be the first to offer you my homage.

[Page 14]
Edmond. (R., puts his hands upon him) On your knees, [425]   Oberto!
Oberto. (C.) This is the great news, my children. Look, daughter, look at this packet,—it's the hand of our late queen. Rodolph is not, but Edmond is, the son of King Stanislaus.
Edmond. I?
Elvina. (L.) Edmond?
Edmond. Gracious powers, explain!
Oberto. Yes, yes, I'll read you the letter: listen to me. (reads) “Oberto,”—you see, she knew my name—“Oberto, if this packet”—Here, Elvina, take it yourself, I shall never get through it. (crosses, L.—he gives Elvina the letter, who takes it, trembling and reluctant)
Elvina. (C., reads with emotion) “Oberto, if the child, entrusted to your care at Urzena, be still alive, learn his destiny from this. I have deceived the people; I have deceived my husband. Rodolph is not my son, nor is he the son of Stanislaus. My child was born blind. The bitter disappointment my husband experienced inspired me with the guilty design of deceiving him by a supposed miracle. I had the barbarity to suffer my infant to be taken from me,—that infant, whom you, Oberto, so readily received.”
Oberto. Read, Elvina, read!
Elvina. (reads) “The Palatine of Rava had a son, the same age as mine. It was reported he was dead, and believed so. The child was named Theobald;—'tis Rodolph.”
Oberto. Let me finish. (reads) “I feel my last hour approach; [450]   I shall never behold my child, but, if the officer who is entrusted with this packet should perchance discover your retreat, I command you, Oberto— (raising his voice) I command you, in the name of the gods who watch over the safety of Samartia, instantly to divulge the truth. To your prudence I leave the manner of disclosing it, and of restoring to the true heir of the throne, that name, and those rights, of which my guilt has so long despoiled him. Farewell! Judith, of Bohemia, Queen of Sarmatia.” I shall obey you, madam. (bows respectfully over the packet— Elvina weeps— Edmond kneels, and expresses gratitude—Music) What's the matter, child? Do you weep when our Edmond is—
Edmond. In tears, Elvina? Let me, then, my father—ah, let me destroy this writing.
Oberto. My prince, my king that will be, what mean you?
Elvina. (tenderly) Ah, prince!
Edmond. Say Edmond, my Elvina—always Edmond! Oberto, keep the strictest silence; let Rodolph reign, and let me be still the happy Edmond of my dear Elvina.
Oberto. Keep silent!—No, my dear children, the Queen's
[Page 15]
commands are rendered sacred by her death; they must be obeyed: she calls upon me from me from the tomb—“In the name of the gods, who watch over the safety of Sarmatia, I command you instantly to divulge the truth.”—Come, my prince, let us away.
Enter Molino , hastily, smacking his whip, L. Molino. Come, neighbour, everything is ready.
                                         Music.— Oberto hurries Edmond and Elvina off reluctantly —Exeunt, L.

END OF ACT THE FIRST.
ACT II. Scene First. —A magnificent Temple, with a flight of steps leading to the Vestibule, at the back of which are large folding-doors. —Music. Enter Kalig , R., who stations the Guards , to prevent the Populace from pressing too forward, R.—When they are arranged, exit Kalig , L.—Shouts, drums, &c., R. Enter Oberto, Elvina , and Edmond , R. 1 E. Oberto. Well, my children, here we are at Court. We must endeavour now, to get access to the king; and that I fear, will not be easy.
Elvina. Oh, father! I shudder at the consequences of your resolution. We were so happy!
Oberto. We shall be more so—I pledge myself, we shall.
Edmond. Can you believe so, Oberto? Alas! I fear not. The confused noise of the multitude, who throng towards the palace; their acclamations; the tumultuous preparations for the fete ; everything here confuses my senses, and makes me the more regret my peaceful habitation. Oh, my father! let us return to the village and leave this place and all its pleasures.
Oberto. No, no; my resolution's fixed. This royal magnificence, (trumpets heard at a distance, R.) this superb palace, transport me beyond myself. I think I hear already they call you prince. Come, my children, courage; we must be resolute. (they are proceeding when stopped by the Guards , L.)
Guard. (at the gate) You must not pass.
Kalig. (coming forward, L.) Ah, 'tis Oberto! (to the Guards ) Let them pass—pass them. This young man has the misfortune to be blind: it would be dangerous to let him stay in the crowd.

[Page 16]
Oberto. Sir, is it you? 'Tis fortunate we have met you here so soon. Behold the prince— (pointing to Edmond )
Kalig. (prevents his finishing his sentence) [25]   Beware, Oberto! You are surrounded by Prince Rodolph's spies.
Enter Molino , who is repulsed by the Guards , R. Molino. Let me pass, let me pass! I am of the same party, I tell you.
Kalig. (to the Guards , R.) Pass him.
Molino. Indeed! I'd have you know—Lord! it's my neighbour Oberto; that's his daughter, and the young gentleman that came in my chaise; and you would not, ha, ha, ha! (to Kalig ) Why, these droll gentlemen wouldn't let me pass.
Oberto. Silence, I say. (takes Kalig aside) What is to be done? The paper you gave me—I must show its contents to the king—aye, to the king himself; I must speak to him—some one must help me to an interview, and you are that person.
Kalig. Oberto, I fear there is an insurmountable bar. For a long time past, Stanislaus has only been accessible by Prince Rodolph. Through Rodolph every application must pass before the king will listen to it. Think, then, how impossible— (trumpets without, R.)
Molino. There's a sight. Law, law! how fine, to be sure! Look, miss, do look! Look, Edmond! Ah, what a pity Edmond can't see.
Oberto. Molino, be quiet. (looking out) 'Tis Prince Rodolph passing to the marriage ceremony. What if I throw myself in his way and say I have a petition to present to the king? When he was at my house yesterday, he spoke to me, often called me a brave fellow, and said he would not forget my [50]   hospitality.
Kalig. You know him not: his pride will spurn you from him: besides, should he, by chance, but see the poor blind prince, his suspicions will be instantly awakened. His father, the late Palatine, on his death-bed revealed to him the dreadful secret of his birth; and the fear always haunts him of the discovery of Sarmatia's rightful heir.
Oberto. (in great perplexity) What is to be done? I must hazard something. (crosses, C.) Children—Molino, retire while the prince passes.
                                         They go off, R. U. E. Grand March—Enter Rodolph , R., richly dressed, thoughtful and discontented, followed by Attendants . Oberto. (throwing himself in his way) Prince, I would speak with you. ( Rodolph looks at him haughtily and goes on) My lord, I am the old soldier, whom yesterday—

[Page 17]
Rodolph. (interrupting him hastily) Some other time.
Oberto. (holding him by the cloak) My prince, the affair will admit of no delay.
Rodolph. (disengaging himself quickly) What audacity! Guards! (two Guards advance—they seize Oberto —Music)
Enter Edmond and Elvina , hastily, R. U. E.—she throws her arms around her Father's neck— Kalig steps before Edmond , to prevent his being seen by Rodolph . Rodolph. (after a pause) Could no other time but this be found for your intrusion? But, as you were attentive to me yesterday in the forest, I pardon you. Guards, let them pass; but see that you intrude no more. (march recommences— Rodolph passes on to the ceremony, L.)
Enter Molino , R. U. E. Molino. Oh, dear! oh, dear! what does all this mean? When I saw you step up, and speak to the prince, I expected from his fair promises yesterday, to see you and him go cheek [75]   by jowl—free and easy—no ceremony: you gave him your best wine, and that generally makes an intimacy between the lord and the chimney-sweeper.
                                         Oberto sends Molino off, L. Elvina. (quits her father and goes to Edmond ) My dear Edmond, let us be gone; and let us leave this scene of danger for our peaceful home.
Edmond. Oh, more than father! Oh, dear Oberto! let us return. Till this day I was most happy. What was wanting to make me so? I was beloved by all around me; here, my life is sought by wicked men I never injured. Oh! then, beloved father, listen to me. These poor sightless eyes are filled with drops of gratitude. Let them fall on your dear dear hand, and induce you to pity and indulge me.
Oberto. (much affected) My child, my prince, what can I say? Think of my affection, think of my duty. Your mother calls from the grave—remember her injunction: “In the name of the good powers, who watch over the safety of Sarmatia, I command you to divulge the truth.”
Kalig. Hear me, Oberto. When last we parted, I promised, at the hazard of my life, to serve you; willingly would I lay down that life to save my prince; but danger presses him on every side. Then let his country be his champion—proclaim his wrongs aloud, and in one instant, every loyal heart will swell to serve a prince, so wronged, so virtuous.
Oberto. Ay, but the voice that first proclaims his wrongs [100]   will also sound his knell.
Kalig. Stanislaus loves Rodolph as his son. He is about to give his hand in marriage to the fair Lida, Duchess of Lithuania;
[Page 18]
should the king find Edmond blind, and lowly bred, he might wish to conceal his rights; a public declaration would render that impossible.
                                         (trumpets are heard without, L.) Oberto. The procession advances. The moment is at hand. How my old heart beats. Rouse, rouse! Recollect, Oberto, the fate of Sarmatia is in your hands.
                                         Exit with Edmond, Elvina , and Kalig , R. U. E. Trumpets, &c. flourish as the King advances.—Enter the King with Lida on his L., and Rodolph on his R., attended by his Court , from the L.—grand procession—they go towards R.— Music. Stanis. My loyal subjects, indulge your mirth—celebrate the happiness of your prince, of your king, who, in this august alliance, has considered but your welfare and the happiness of Sarmatia.
                                         (the C. doors are thrown open—the Bishop , attended by Priests, Incense Bearers , &c., receives him—the betrothed couple bow before him—the Bishop raises his hands over them, in the act of blessing them) High Priest. I here betroth Prince Rodolph, son of Stanislaus—
Oberto comes forward, R., followed by Edmond and Elvina . Oberto. (with all his force) He is not the son of Stanislaus!
                                         (Music—expressive of astonishment and general confusion— the King, Lida , and Rodolph come forward) Stanis. Who is the rash, audacious man?
Oberto. (taking Edmond's hand) My liege, behold your son!
Rodolph. (L.) His son!
Oberto. (offers the King the packet) Yes, my liege, your son. Deign but to cast your eyes on this writing.
Stanis. 'Tis the writing of the queen.
                                         (Music—expressive of astonishment—the King seems greatly agitated while reading and frequently takes his eyes off the packet to look at Edmond , then reads on) Stanis. (aside) What have I read? (approaches Edmond , takes his hand, and looks at him with fixed attention)
Oberto. (low to Edmond ) 'Tis the king. (Music— Edmond kneels with reverence and affection)
Stanis. [125]   These features—so like the queen! The writing too! (aside) We will return to the palace. (to Edmond ) Come, unfortunate youth! Rodolph, let the council be instantly assembled!                                          Exit Rodolph , L. In their presence we will read this letter, and interrogate Oberto—no means must be left untried to ascertain the truth,
[Page 19]
(to the High Priest ) Holy pontiff, the marriage rites must be suspended.
                                         Music—the High Priest , &c., turn to the Temple—Tableau, closed in by Scene Second. —A Piazza surrounding the Palace. Enter Stanislaus and Rodolph , L. Stanis. Rodolph, I have sought to be alone with you. By the extraordinary occurrences of the day, I have recovered a son whom Nature bids me cherish and regard; but he shall not destroy the paternal affection I feel for thee, my Rodolph.
Rodolph. Not Rodolph now, my liege.
Stanis. But still the Palatine of Rava, by the right of birth. Rodolph, though he ceases to be my son, has still a claim on my affection, and on my justice, too: I will repay it, therefore, with the fair hand of the duchess, whom you so much love, and the dukedom of Lithuania, which you so well deserve.
Rodolph. Ah! my liege, when Edomnd once begins to wind himself about your heart, then farewell Lithuania's new-made duke!
Stanis. Never, Rodolph; for, should fate call Edmond from me, Lithuania's duke succeeds to Stanislaus. My confidence in you is as unbounded as my love: I have committed young Edmond to your charge; and, as a farther earnest of my love, I place this ring, of value most inestimable, upon your finger. Should you, at any time, perceive my affection diminish, present this to my view, and I will instantly fold you to my heart, and you shall be my son again.
                                         Exit, L. Rodolph. Ah! then Lithuania's duke succeeds, if Edmond falls—why, then, my hopes revive. I have already placed a [25]   guard, devoted to my service, over the young prince—I have also taken care to have Oberto and his daughter removed from him. Now, Starow, where is that dagger which peeped, officious, from its scabbard, to greet the enemy I only dreaded. He's found, he's found, he's found! and now, indeed, I lack thy murderous aid.
Enter Starow , R. Rodolph. Ah, Starow, this cursed boy!
Starow. (R.) My prince, I've heard it all; but joy to find you have him in your power.
Rodolph. (C.) I have, my friend; and 'tis your kind hand must rid me of the charge; but how, my friendly Starow—how?
Starow. My lord, the night is dark, the wind rages, and
[Page 20]
the Vistula rolls wide and deep under the window of young Edmond's prison.
Rodolph. 'Tis well conceived; but I must not appear in this. Is there no friendly hand, whose aid you can confide in for the task?
Starow. My lord, have you observed a dejected man about the court, who seems to brood in silence over his wrongs?
Rodolph. What, Kalig?
Starow. The same, my prince. Him I've noted for a purpose like the present.
Rodolph. I like him not; but, better he than one I do; for he must not survive, to blab the tale. Thus let it be: soon as the day shuts in, I will myself conduct the prince—you shall [50]   receive him from my hand—my voice must not be heard; you and Kalig force him on board a boat—then make what speed you can to gain the centre of the river, leaving Kalig to watch the shore—be sure to gain the middle of the stream, and there—
Starow. I understand, my lord.
Rodolph. Be careful to repeat the name of Kalig frequently in Edmond's hearing, that if any chance should thwart us, he may bear the odium of the crime; and when the boy sinks in the wave, give the signal of success with your horn, and row with all speed some distance down the river. When I hear the signal, I will alarm the palace with the loss of Edmond, and myself encourage the vain search that will be made.
Starow. My prince, I fully comprehend—will instantly find out Kalig, and answer, with my life, that all shall be as you desire.
                                         Crosses, and exit, L. Rodolph. Farewell, villain! Sooner than you suspect, your life may answer it.
Enter Oberto and Elvina , R. Oberto. My lord, you have given orders that no person shall approach the apartments of Prince Edmond. I suppose 'twas through forgetfulness that my daughter and myself were not excepted.
Rodolph. The order is a general one, and admits of no exception.
Elvina. What are we forbidden to see the prince? we, who [75]   have sworn never to leave him?
Rodolph. You may sometimes, perhaps be allowed to see him.
Elvina. Sometimes! oh, heavens!
Oberto. My child, the prince means daily.
Rodolph. The prince has no such meaning. Oberto, you forget; you fail in the respect you owe me.

[Page 21]
Oberto. Pardon me, my lord, but I shall fail still more, if 'tis your intention to imprison the son of your master.
Rodolph. Oberto, leave me. (partly draws his sword)
Elvina. Oh, my father!
Oberto. Child, I tell you, I will speak; it shall never be said that Oberto brought up the heir to Sarmatia's crown, that he loved him as his son for twenty years, and that in one day he tamely gave consent to a life-long banishment from the boy he so loved. My lord, I ask not, for what I have done, honour, dignity, or wealth, but let me be near my Edmond. I have told you how I love him, and must and will see him daily.
Rodolph. (aside) Let me constrain my rage. (to Oberto ) Well, sir, calm your anger—wait patiently but till to-morrow, and then—
                                         Exit, L. Oberto. Oh! Elvina, what does he mean? Wait till to-morrow! A dreadful night intervenes before that morrow. Ah! why did I not listen to the poor afflicted boy this morning? He said right—we were happy. Wretch that I am! my cursed [100]   ambition has destroyed him. Ye protectors of innocence oppressed, avert all dangers from Prince Edmond's head! On me, on me, direct their murderous aim! Come, my child, let us fly to save our prince, or perish nobly with him.
                                         Exeunt, L.—Music. Scene Third. —The Banks of the Vistula.—A terrace, under which the water is seen—high and winding rocks, R., against which the Vistula dashes with great fury—in the C., a boat— night—stage dark. Kalig and Starow discovered—they part— Starow goes towards the terrace—Music. Starow. (on the terrace) Remember, you have sworn. (music)
                                         Exit, Starow , L. U. E. Kalig. What is to be done? A few short moments, and Edmond will be here; and I am singled out to help in this base murder! what if I fly to the palace, and reveal the whole? But assistance will arrive too late, and the crime—hold, let me consider—Starow said Rodolph will not be with us—Starow alone—then, danger, I defy you.
                                         Music.— Rodolph appears on the terrace, L. U. E., holding Edmond by one hand— Edmond appears uneasy— Starow has a horn suspended round his neck. Edmond. Why does this hand grasp mine so violently? Why does it tremble so? Pray answer me. Where would you lead me? (he is led forward by Rodolph—Rodolph signs Starow to answer)
Starow. (advancing close to Edmond , C.) I have already told
[Page 22]
you, my lord, to that part of the palace where Oberto and his daughter wait for you. We could not resist the entreaties of the amiable Elvina; and whilst Prince Rodolph is busy with the king, we have seized the opportunity to lead you to your friends. Come, my lord, come on. ( Rodolph endeavours to force him)
Edmond. (resisting) But I am not in the palace now; the air which blows upon me—
Starow. We are in one of the courts which we must cross to—
Edmond. (C.) A court! 'tis a very large one, then. 'Tis filled with trees and flowers.
Rodolph. (R. C.) Ha!
Edmond. And bordered by a river.
Starow. (embarrassed) [25]   A river!
Edmond. (pointing with left hand) Yes; 'tis there—I hear the noise of water. I feel the moisture that exhales from it.
Rodolph. (low and impatiently) Come on—come on.
Edmond. Is not that Prince Rodolph's voice?
Starow. No, my lord; my comrade, Kalig.
Edmond. Kalig?
Starow. Yes; he urges us to lose no time. Let us begone.
Edmond. (uneasy) You must conduct me back from whence you brought me.
Starow. I mean it, my prince.
Edmond. I am not safe here.
Starow. Why so, my lord?
                                         ( Rodolph tries to get his hand away from Edmond ) Edmond. I tell you, I am not in safety.
Kalig. (R.) Indeed, my prince, I promise you, you are. I answer to you, you have nothing now to fear.
                                         ( Rodolph struggles with Edmond ) Edmond. Why do you force your hand from me?—If you leave me in this strange place, I shall be in danger.
                                         ( Rodolph gets his hand away) Kalig. My prince, I only wish, as the evening is dark, to explore the way for you. (coming up to him, and taking his hand) All is safe, and now I can conduct you without danger.
Edmond. Oh, heaven! how many of you are there?—This is not the hand which just now—
Kalig. 'Tis the hand of a friend, my lord; be not uneasy.
Edmond. Oh, who could be so cruel as to take advantage of [50]   my wretched situation.
                                         Rodolph makes signs of impatience, and points to the boat. Starow. (pulls him forward) Come, my prince, come.
Edmond. No; a storm threatens, and if we go farther—
Starow. A storm, did he say?

[Page 23]
Kalig. Yes, he's right, the night looks black. (lightning)
Starow. 'Tis nothing but a few passing clouds, and will soon be over.
Edmond. I tell you, 'twill be terrible. (distant thunder) Did you hear that?—The thunder rolls already.
                                         Rodolph mounts the terrace, and exit, L. U. E., pointing to the boat— Starow leads Edmond a few paces towards the terrace, and then turns away, R. Starow. Well, then, my lord, we will return to your apartment.
Edmond. Stop—this is not the way we came—there— (pointing to the L.— Starow forces him towards the boat, C.— Edmond resists forcibly) Villains! where is the traitor that employs you?
Starow. My lord, 'tis needless—you must come with us.
Edmond. Vile wretches! Oh, that my cries may—
                                         Music. Kalig. Now, heaven assist me!
                                         Kalig leaves the Prince , and goes round to Starow , takes hold of the horn that hangs to his neck, and throws him from the Prince round to R.—the chain of the horn breaks, and Kalig draws his sabre—they stand for a moment, gazing at each other. Starow. Ah, traitor!
Kalig. Thou liest—I am no traitor, but while this arm can wield a sword, it shall protect its lawful prince. (they fight towards the rock, R. U. E.)
Edmond. Oh, whither shall I fly! Oh, Oberto! oh, Elvina, come to my aid! (lightning—he goes off, L. 1 E.)
Enter Elvina from the terrace, L. U. E. Elvina. (comes forward) Sure I heard the voice of Edmond. He called on me! on my father! Ha! what noise is that? (noise of swords up the rock, R. U. E.) Swords gleam through the darkness of the night. Perhaps some succour to the oppressed. I see them—good heavens! what fury animates [75]   them!
Kalig. (on the top of the rock, R. U. E.) Die, perfidious wretch! (thrusts his sword into Starow's breast, and forces him over the rock into the river, R. U. E.)
Elvina. How dreadful this suspense! I see not Edmond. (thunder and lightning) Hark! did I not hear footsteps? (looks out) 'Tis one of the men who—ah, he comes this way. (hurrying —Music—she runs and hides herself, R.)
Enter Kalig , from the rock, R. U. E., looking about with cautious uneasiness, holding the horn which Starow had. Kalig. Not here! What has become of him? Where is he
[Page 24]
gone? What's to be done? Ah! I'll sound this horn, with which the traitor Starow was to inform his master that the prince was dead. Rodolph, deceived by the well-known signal, will alarm the palace, and assist me to save him whom he had devoted to destruction.
                                         Kalig goes towards the balustrade at the bottom, and sounds the horn, then exit up the terrace, L. U. E. Elvina. Good heavens! 'tis some dreadful signal! perhaps the one that Rodolph waits for; where shall I bend my steps? —Edmond! Edmond! answer your Elvina.
                                         Goes off, R.—lightning. Re-enter Edmond , L., and crosses to the rock, R. Edmond. Here my Elvina, here. This way I heard her voice. Elvina! my dear Elvina! (goes up the rock, R. U. E.— Elvina runs on in terror)
Elvina. (looking off, R.) I heard him call my name. (lightning) Oh, heavens! by the gleam of the lightning's flash, I thought I saw him upon the rock. (lightning) Yes, 'tis Edmond! unhappy youth! one false step!—oh! let me fly to save him!
                                         Music—she runs up the rock, R. U. E.—thunder and lightning increase—during the flashes, Edmond is seen on the summit of the rock, R. U. E. Edmond. Almighty powers! send some pitying mortal to conduct my steps. From the sharp air which surrounds me, I think I stand on the edge of some frightful precipice. I [100]   will advance a few steps more.
                                         ( Elvina is seen climbing up the rock—at the sight of Edmond , who is just at the edge of the precipice, she stops a moment aud utters a shriek of horror, and exclaims, “Edmond! Edmond!”—Music) Edmond. Elvina!
                                         (he falls into her arms, R. U. E.— Elvina leads Edmond down the winding path behind a large mass of trees, &c., which conceal them from the spectators) Enter Rodolph , from the terrace, speaking to the Guards , bearing torches, who have Kalig in custody—stage light. Rodolph. Soldiers, disperse yourselves throughout the gardens; be watchful; prevent a dreadful crime. One of the villains I have already secured.
                                         Exeunt Four Guards , R. and L. U. E. Enter Oberto , from the terrace, L. U. E. Oberto. Oh, a curse upon all traitors! Edmond has disappeared:
[Page 25]
who had the care of him? Who but Rodolph? Rodolph is the murderer.
Rodolph. (half draws his sword) Ah!
Oberto. Yes, villain, strike! You told me I should see my child to-morrow. Then, for once, keep thy hellish promise; strike through this poor broken heart, and let me join my murdered boy. (throws himself on the rock)
Enter Stanislaus , from the terrace, L.— Officers, Guards , and Domestics , with torches, &c. Stanis. Say, Rodolph, have they yet found my son?
Rodolph. My liege, the guards this moment search the park, the gardens, and the borders of the river.
Stanis. Who can have planned this act of horror?
Rodolph. It is difficult to guess.
                                         ( Elvina and Edmond are seen coming down the rock, R. U. E.) Oberto. Prince Edmond—Prince Edmond is safe!
                                         (runs up the rock, embraces him, and then brings him down to the King ) Stanis. (embracing him) My son! my son!
Rodolph. (aside) I am betrayed.
Stanis. My son, know you the traitors who assailed you?
Edmond. I think there were three; one of them scarce spoke. A single word, in a low tone, escaped him, and I thought I recognized—but no, it cannot be—I might have [125]   been deceived.
Rodolph. (to Edmond ) My lord, did not the assassins address each other by their names?
Edmond. Yes; one of them, I think, was called Kalig.
Stanis. (L. U. E.) Kalig!
Rodolph. (R., to Stanislaus ) Mark that, my liege—the man I have taken.
Oberto. (with energy) No, my king, never believe it. Though he should himself confess, I never could believe it. Kalig, speak—what means all this?
Kalig. It means, my sovereign, that Starow was engaged by Rodolph to destroy the Prince. Starow employed me to aid him, but I slew the villain.
Rodolph. Starow dead!
Stanis. Rodolph!
Rodolph. (to Stanislaus ) Vain subterfuge! If Starow is no more, he has lost his life in endeavouring to save the prince.
Edmond. I have every reason to think that one of them resolved to defend me. But, for the wicked man who dragged me from the palace, he perhaps, may be discovered.
Stanis. How, my dear boy?

[Page 26]
Edmond. Why, in dragging away his hand, which I wished to keep in mine, he left this ring.
                                         (gives it to the King —pause of astonishment—Music) Stanis. 'Tis the ring I gave to Rodolph. Guards, seize him.
Rodolph. I know the punishment that awaits me; but I [150]   prefer death to the torment of seeing my rival mount that throne, so long my destined prize.
                                         ( Stanislaus motions the Guards , who lead off Rodolph , L.) Stanis. (to Kalig ) Brave man, I will reward your zeal. My age requires repose. You, I invest with the sovereign power—exercise it as you think right.
Edmond. (takes Elvina's hand) Oh, my father, then I am blessed indeed! Elvina will be my bride, and Oberto still my father.

SCENE I.                                          —The Interior of the Mug, Public House—a Clock in an oaken case, R.—beyond the clock a spit and a musket fastened to the wall—below these four shelves containing plates of pewter and delf—over the dresser, on the other side of these things, is a picture of Mrs. Lobkins, in a scarlet body and a hat and plumes—at the back a blanket hung across a door angularly, covered with ballads, &c.                                          Mrs. Lobkins , smoking a pipe, seated near a cheerful fire, l. —Dummie Dunnaker seated quietly at a table, C., ruminating over a glass of Hollands and water— Tommy Tobyson and two priggish-looking gentry discovered, R. GLEE.— Tommy Tobyson and Thieves .

On the stream of the world, the robber's life
   Is borne on the blithest wave;
Now it bounds into light in a gladsome strife,
   Now it laughs in its hiding cave.
Hurrah! for the booty! my steed, hurra!
   Thorough bush, thorough brake go we;
And the coy moon smiles on our merry way,
   Like my own love—timidly.

Oh, there never was life like the robber's, so
   Jolly and bold and free;
And its end? why, a cheer from the crowd below,
   And a leap from the leafless tree!
Hurrah! for the revel! my steed, hurrah!
   Thorough bush, thorough brake go we;
It is ever a virtue when others pay
   To ruffle it merrily Tom. (R.) Now then, my covies, down with the brads for the lush, and let's out on the tramp to fork a fogle or a ticker.
                                         [Tommy Tobyson and the two other Prigs pay their reckoning and exeunt, I. S. E.
[Page 12]
Dum. (C.) I say, Piggy Lob—Ask pardon, Mrs. Lobkins—vere's leetle Paul?
Mrs. L. (L.) He's gone to a hop and a feed at Bachelor Bill's, in Fiddler's Row; it's unkimmon genteel, 'cause as how on the card of inwitation it vere writ, [25]   “Gentlemen is expected to come in pumps.”
Dum. Ah, that ere Bachelor Bill is a crack cove among all the most fashionablest prigs and tobymen; his bingo's unixciptionable, and as for his stark naked, it's woted the most brilliantest thing in natur.
Mrs. L. Why, yes, I thought it would be a good thing for Paul to get him inwited,—so I intimidated as much to Bill; for I love Paul as if he vas a kid of my own.
Dum. Excuse me, Mrs. L., but I am unkimmonly afeard as how leetle Paul—I must call him leetle, cause I've knowed him so long—I'm afeard leetle Paul may, through the swells he'll meet there, become a leetle too genteel in his notions, and be ruined.
Mrs. L. Vat do you mean, Mr. Dunnaker?
Dum. Vy, there's that ere Edward Pepper, Long Ned as they calls him, vat vears sich a lot of hair—I knows him vell—a parson of wery dangerous morals, and not by no manner of means a fit sociate for a young gemman of cractur, like leetle Paul—if he continues that ere course much longer, he'll soon be knowed as the gentleman of three outs—out of pocket, out of elbows, and out of credit.
Mrs. L. Vell, if I ar'nt as astonished as a stuck pig. There be nothing like a friend in need, Dummie. [Laying her hand on his shoulder.] Somehow or other, I thinks [50]   as how you knows more of the horigin of that ere lad than any of us.
Dum. Me, dame!
Mrs. L. Ah, you—you knows as how the mother saw more of you just afore she died, than she did of ere a one of us. Tell us all about un. Did she steal, think you?
Dum. Lauk, Mother Margery! dost think I knows? Vot put sich a crochet in your ead?
Mrs. L. Vell, I alvays thought as how you vere more knowing about it than you owns. Dear, dear! I shall never forgit the night when Judith brought the poor cretur here. I stared at the brat, and it stretched out its wee little hands to me, and the mother frowned at it, and throwed it into my lap.

[Page 13]
Dum. I as heard as how Judith was once kept by a great lord.
Mrs. L. Like enough—like enough!—She was always a favourite of mine, for she had a spurrit as big as my own.
Dum. Ay, I knows as how you liked her, cause vhy 'Tis not your vay to let a room to a voman; you says as how 'tis not respectable, and you likes men to wisit the Mug.
Mrs. L. And I doesn't like all them as comes here! [75]   specially for Paul's sake; but what can a lone ooman do? Many's the gentleman highwayman wot comes here, whose money is as good as the clerk's of the parish. And when a bob is in the hand, what does it signify whose hand it vas in afore?
Dum. That's vot I calls vot I calls being sinsible and practical.
Mrs. L. How spiteful the vorld be!—specially if a ooman keeps a fashionable sort of public. When Judith died, Joe, the dog's-meat man, said I war all the better for it, and that she left I a treasure to bring up the urchin. I got nothing more than a watch and ten guineas when Judy died, and sure, that scarce paid for the burrel.
Dum. You forgits the two quids I give you for the hold box of rags—much of a treasure I found there!
                                         [With sycophantic archness. Mrs. L. Ay, I fancies you were not pleased with the bargain. Drink, Dummie, drink, I scorns to score lush to a friend. You sees, Dummie, I loves that boy as much as if I war is raal mother; I vants to make him an honour to his country, and an exciption to my family.
Dum. Who all flashed their iwories at Surgeons' Hall.
Mrs. L. True—they died game, and I be'nt ashamed of 'em. But I owes a duty to Paul's mother, and I wants Paul to have a long life.
Paul Clifford. [Without, L. S. E.] [100]   Adieu for the present, Harry! Au revoir , as the great Augustus used to say.
Dum. Here he comes, and a leetle lushy. I'll bet two hogs to a tanner he's been to Fish Lane, and got cleaned out, as usual. I say, dame, you read him a bit of a lectur, and I'll bide behind the settle.
                                         [Retires behind the settle, R. S. E.
[Page 14]
Enter Paul Clifford , at the door, L. S. E. Paul. Again a loser—well, nil desperandum — [Crosses to R.] It must be either ignorance or ill luck; for, among friends, what else can it be. I wish I had remained at Bachelor Bill's, shaking a leg, instead of going to rattle the ivories—Ah, dame, are you there?
Mrs. L. Yes, I am here, Master Paul; but you bounces in, and treats me with no more respect than if I were a carrion crow.
Paul (R.) Don't say so, mother—that's the unkindest cut of all.
Mrs. L. None of your palavering, it won't do.—Who do you stop out with every night, eh?
Paul. Why, with Harry Finish, Charley Trywit, and Hookey.
Mrs. L. And what do you do?
Paul. My modesty forbids me to tell you, mother.
Mrs. L. [Aside.] Bless his dear eyes. [Aloud.] None of your humbug; I tell you you goes to Fish Lane every night, to rattle the ivories—don't deny it.
Paul. [125]   Who told you so?
Mrs. L. What's that to you—I know it, and that's enough.
Paul. Well, I must go somewhere.
Mrs. L. Why?
Paul. Because of the uncomfortable life I lead at home; that devil's own temper of yours had almost made me often resolve to leave the house altogether.
Mrs. L. Well then, Paul, my ben cull, I knows my feelings are unkimmonly strong. I'll not speak cross to thee again, if thou wilt but stay at home.
Paul. Well, after to-night I will.
Mrs. L. Why, you are not going out again?
Paul. I must, mother; I've promised to return to Fish Lane, and, see, my pockets are to be let unfurnished.
Mrs. L. Why, this is the third time this week.
Paul. Third and last time of asking, good mother; and I trust you will not show any just cause why the money and my pockets should not come together.
Mrs. L. Look ye, my kinchen cove: if so be as how you goes for to think as how I shall go for to supply your wicious necessities, you will see yourself planted in Queer Street. Blow me tight if I gives you another mag.
                                         [Turns her chair, and fills her pipe.
[Page 15]
Paul. But I owe Long Ned a guinea, and Dummie Dunnaker lent me three crowns. It ill becomes your [150]   heir apparent, my dear dame, to fight shy of his debts of honour.
Mrs. L. Taradididdle, don't think for to wheedle me with your debts and your honour; Long Ned is as long in the forks as he is in the back: may old Harry fly off with him! and as for Dummie Dunnaker, I wonders how you, brought up such a swell, and blest with the wery best of hedications, can think of putting up with such wulgar sociates. I tells you what, you'll please to break wi them, smack at once, or devil a brad you'll ever get from Peggy Lobkins.
Paul. [With great solemnity, after walking up and down the room twice, and then stopping before Mrs. Lobkins.] If you won't give it me, I am determined, with many thanks for past favours to throw myself on the world, and seek my fortune.
Mrs. L. I'fecks, Muster Pride-in-duds! seek your fortune yourself, will ye? This comes of my bringing you up, and letting you eat the bread of idleness and charity. Had you christened Paul, after my grandfather, who was three times transported and twice hanged, because I thought it a lucky name—you toad of a thousand! Take that and be cursed to you!
                                         [She throws the pipe at Paul Clifford—it misses him—Dummie Dunnaker comes forward at the moment, and receives it in his eye—Paul is greatly agitated, and, giving Mrs. Lobkins a severe look, walks slowly towards the door. Mrs. L. [Following Paul, and catching him by the arm.] Where be you going, you imp of the world? [Paul shakes her off.] Get in with you, and say no more on the matter, be a bob cull, and drop the bullies, and you shall [175]   have the blunt.
Paul. I will eat the bread of idleness and charity no longer. [Sullenly.] Good by; if ever I can pay you what I have cost you, I will.
                                         [Exit, L. S. E. Mrs. L. [In a rage.] And may the dark-coloured gentleman who keeps the fire-office below go along with you.
Dum. [Rubbing his eye.] This comes of being acquainted vith ladies as has no temper.
Mrs. L. [Seizing Dummie by the eollar, and giving him a blow on the other eye.] And this is all through you, you warmint! I'll teach you, you bloodsucker, to spunge on them as has expectations—I'll teach you to cozen the
[Page 16]
heir of the Mug, you snivelling, whey-faced ghost of a farthing rushlight. What, you'll lend my Paul three crowns, will you? Oh, you're a queer one, I warrants, but you won't queer Margery Lobkins.
Dum. You wrongs me, Mrs. L.
Mrs. L. Out of my ken, ye cur of the mange—out of my ken! And if ever I knows as how you makes a flat of my Paul, blow me tight but I'll weave you a hempen collar. Oh, you wiper, budge and begone!
[Music—Air, “Oh, Polly is a sad Slut”—she kicks and beats Dummie off, then goes to the bottle and takes a glass, and falls into her chair in hysterics. SCENE II. Old London Bridge, by Moonlight. Enter Paul Clifford, R. Paul. To be told I am a beggar, and exist upon charity! It shall go hard but I will carve a fortune for myself, in spite of mankind and its double ways.
Enter Dummie Dunnaker , out of breath, R. Dum. Leetle Paul, leetle Paul! Oh, what, I'se cotched you at last; vell, Mister Paul, don't you think as ow I'm a hillused indiwidual? Mister Paul, do you hear vot I says?
Paul. (L.) Sir!
Dum. (R.) Don't sir me—I'm no more a sir nor you is.
Paul. What do you mean?
Dum. Vot does I mean? Vhy, you gets into a row vith that old cat-omoran, and then you leave me to git the vopping. But it sarves me right for taking any consarn about a cull vot has neither wituals nor wages, but vot folks as is respectable chooses to give him.
Paul. Say that again, and, by heaven, I'll knock you down!
Dum. [Retreating and lowering his tone.] Knock me down! Oh, leetle Paul, vot vhicked vhids are those! Vot, Dummie Dunnaker, as has dandled you on his knee, mony's a time and oft; vy, the cove's art is as ard as junk, and as proud as a gardener's dog vith a nosegay tied to his tail.
Paul. Well, Dummie, I didn't mean to hurt you, and [25]   there's an end of it; so I wish you good night.
Dum. Vhy, vhere be you trotting to, leetle Paul?
Paul. The deuce a bit I know, but I think I shall drop a call on Long Ned.

[Page 17]
Dum. A vast there! If so be as ow you 'ont blab, I'll tell you a bit of a secret—I heered as how Long Ned had started for Hampshire this wery morning, on a toby consarn.
Paul. Ha! then hang me if I know what to do; where to fine the Benefits of Bed and Board, I know not—and to return to the Mug, I'm resolved I never will.
Dum. Vy, Paul, my kid, you looks down in the chops; cheer up—care killed a cat. [Winking and nudging Paul.] Paul, my ben cull, vot do you say to a drop of blue ruin? or, as you like's to be conish, I doesn't care if I sports you a glass of port.
Paul. [Starting from his reverie.] Ah, I have it— M'Grawler—my pen and purse have ever been at his service, and I can depend on his gratitude and friendship, at least for a temporary shelter, if not for something more permanent; but, be assured, I shall not forget your kindness in this dark hour of my life. And now for M'Grawler.
                                         [Exit, L. Dum. Poor leetle Paul! How unkimmonly wexing it is to see human natur as is human natur a running to [50]   waste—Poor leetle Paul! if I don't go and get drop in my eye, I shall cry outright.
                                         [Exit, L. Enter Long Ned, r. Ned. So, once more in town, after having bagged as pretty a booty as ever fell to the luck of a gentleman highwayman. Now, then, hey for life—silver-clocked silks stockings, and Raneglagh; and, when the swag's out, to horse and away for more. Who comes here? [Stands aside.] He seems ruffled.
Enter Paul Clifford, l. Paul. This cold-hearted scoundrel, this M'Grawler, after having benefited by me in every way, refuses me even the shelter of his roof. Oh, that such half-souled wretches were placed beyond the law's protection, that I might lash them into feeling for their fellow-creatures!
Ned. [Laying his hand on Paul's shoulder.] How dost, my fine fellow? Dam'me, but you look the worse for wear. What hast been doing with thyself?
Paul. Ha! and is it Long Ned whom I behold? I am indeed glad to meet you.
Ned. [Looking through an eye-glass.] Stap my vitals, but you are a comical quiz—ha, ha, ha! I wonder what the
[Page 18]
women would say, if they saw the dashing Edward Pepper, Esq., walking arm-in-arm with thee at Ranelagh. Why, thou look'st like a book of my grandfather's, called Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, and, faith! a shabbier-bound copy of it I never saw.
Paul. [75]   This jesting is a little hard.
Ned. Prithee, forgive me, and tell me what's the matter with thee?
Paul. The fact is, a breach has taken place between Mrs. Lobkins and myself—I am now thrown upon the world, and would gladly avail myself of any active profession.
Ned. [Aside.] He's just in the humour I wanted to get him for a long time, and half primed for my purpose. [Aloud.] Take a shot from my pocket pistol, and I'll let thee into a secret. [Gives a flask to Paul, who drinks.] Now, my good Paul, I trust I shall be able to open to your genius a new career, in which guineas are had for the asking—take another drop—in which you may wear fine clothes, and ogle the ladies at Ranelagh; and, when you are tired of glory and liberty, why, you have only to make your bow to an heiress or a widow, with a spanking fortune, and quit the hum of men like a Cincinnatus. Come, man, we'll argue the matter over a glass of good port.
Paul. Any port in a storm, but not your's, my Colossus of Roads. I cannot enter into your plans; and, as a proof of my resolution, I shall drink no more, for my eyes already begin to dance; and if I listen longer to your resistless eloquence, my feet may share the same fate.
Ned. [100]   Since you won't drink, what say you to an excursion to play to-night? Garrick acts.
Paul. Done.
Ned. Done. But, bless me, I have forgotten one thing.
Paul. What?
Ned. Why, my fine Paul, consider, the play is a bang-up sort of place—look at your coat and waistcoat, that's all. But never droop, man—I know an honest tradesman, who keeps a ready-made shop just by the theatre, who will fit you out in a moment.
                                         [Crosses to L. Paul. Allons, then.
Ned. You must follow me—I can't walk with thee—it would look too like Northumberland House and the

butcher's abode next door taking a strole together. Keep a little behind, very little—that will do. [Aside.] They'll take him for a bailiff—it looks handsome, now-a-days, to be so attended—it shows one had credit once.
                                         [Exit Paul Clifford and Long Ned, L. SCENE III. Exterior of Drury-Lane Theatre, in Garrick's time—Cads calling out various names—Link-Boys showing parties away, &c.—Music.—Air, “'Tis Woman that seduces all Mankind.” Cad. Mr. William Brandon's carriage.
Enter Long Ned and Paul Clifford , L. Ned. Stap my vitals! we are too late. Never mind, we can see if anything is to be picked up.
Paul. What do you mean?
Enter Brandon and Lucy , from the theatre. Bra. (R.) [Looking at his watch.] My dear Lucy, it's later than I imagined.
Paul. (L. C.) [Looking at Lucy.] What a beautiful face.
Ned. [Who has been eyeing the watch.] Is the face gold then, as well as the back?
Paul. I beg you will find some other subject of jesting. Is that her father, I wonder?—Yet one can hardly believe one so lovely to be the daughter of so stern a being as that.
Enter Servant, L. Ser. [To Brandon.] Sir, the carriage is close at hand, but I fear it will be some time before we can draw up.
Bra. Can you walk to the carriage, my dear Lucy?
Lucy. (R. C.) Certainly, my dear uncle.
Bra. [To Servant] Precede us.
                                         [They go towards L. Ned. Come on.
[Ned rushes by Brandon, and snatches his watch. Bra. Stop thief!
Ned. [Running past Paul, who is still gazing at Lucy.] Shift for yourself—run!
                                         [Exit rapidly, L. Paul. What say you?
Bra. [Turning round, and seizing Paul.] Rascal, my watch!
Paul. [25]   Watch! take your hand from my throat, sir, or—
                                         [Raising his hand. Lucy. For mercy's sake, do not strike my uncle!
Paul. Fear nothing, lady; for your sake I will refrain from resenting this indignity.

[Page 20]
Bra. Unparalleled scoundrel!—My watch, I say!
Enter Watchman , L. Wat. Ay, young man, this gentleman's watch. Please your honour, I be a watch, too—shall I take up this chap?
Bra. By all means; I would not have lost the watch for twice its value. I am sure I saw this fellow's companion snatch it from my fob. The thief's gone, but we have at least the accomplice. I give him in strict charge to you, watchman—take the consequences if you let him escape.
Wat. Oh, sir, we knows our duty, without being threatened into it.
Bra. Don't answer me, fellow; do as I tell you.
Luc. Pray let him go, uncle.
Bra. You know not what you ask, Lucy; the law must take its course.
                                         [Exeunt Lucy and Brandon, L. Paul. The law! am I, then, to be punished for a crime I never committed, nor dreamed of committing?
Wat. Come along—none of your gammon—it won't friz.
Paul. Nay, then, I'll take the law into my own hands.
[Music.—Air, “My Heart was so Free.”—Paul wrenches himself from the gripe of one Watchman, knocks down the other, and is about to make his escape, when he is felled to the ground by the staff of the first Watchman, and carried off insensible. SCENE IV. —A Justice-Room—table, &c., arranged in order.—Music.—Air, “Through all the Employments of Life.”—Officers, &c., discovered. Enter Justice Burnflat , R. Jus. B. [Seating himself at the table, near the flat, C.] Now bring in the prisoner.
Enter Dummie Dunnaker , guarded, R. Jus. B. What, Mr. Dummie, you here again?
Dum. Yes, your vorship; and I ope your vorship's vell, and von't listen to vot they has to say agin me.
Jus. B. [To the Officer.] What has he been doing?
Wat. (R.) He was found dead drunk, your worship, in the kennel.
Dum. (R.) No, I were dead beat.
Jus. B. (C.) Dead beat!
Dum. Yes, sir; it were accident. You see, your vorship, cause I stumbled and fell vith my ead sich a vop
[Page 21]
agin the curbstone, that the sentinel at Vindsor might ha' heard the sound of the blow as plain as he did the clock of St. Paul's, if the vind had blowed that vay.
[Voices without, L.] Make way there, make way.
Jus. B. What's the matter?
Offi. It's Lawyer Brandon, sir. [Aside.] As he's a cute fellow, it will go hard with the person he complains of.
Enter Brandon , L. Jus. B. Mr. Brandon, I am delighted to see you. Take a seat.
Bra. I shall be obliged if you will proceed to my business immediately.
Jus. B. Certainly, Mr. Brandon; I will but dispose of this fellow, and yours shall come next.
Dum. [25]   Oh, please your vorship, you needn't take up your time with my consarns—I don't vant to be exposed; and if you let's I go without never a word, I shan't be affronted.
Jus. B. Silence, sir. This fellow, Mr. Brandon, is incorrigible—I wish you would advise what would be the best mode of punishing him.
Bra. Really, sir, the law is too lenient to these pests of society; if I had my will, they should be sent to cultivate our colonies, and thus prevent the traffic in our unoffending fellow-creatures, the Blacks.
                                         [Sits. Dum. Vell, that's making black appear vhite, vith a wengeance.
Jus. B. Silence, sir, and learn to treat the opinions of your superiors with respect.
Dum. Vat for should he 'tempt to prejudice your vorship for again me, vithout he's feed.
Jus. B. If you do not hold your tongue, I'll order you to hard labour for a couple of months.
Dum. Aha! if so be Counsellor Brandon knowed vot I knows, he vouldn't go for to bully I so.
Bra. And pray what is it you know?
Dum. Humph!
Jus. B. If he doesn't answer, make out his committal.
Dum. Vell, then, let him hax Mr. Swoppem, the pawnbroker, [50]   of Three-Ball Alley, vot I sold him on the 15th hof February, exactly twenty years ago.
Bra. [Starting back, violently agitated.] What say you? Speak further—yet stay—not now, not now, my good fellow. You had better let this man go: to send him to
[Page 22]
gaol would only crowd them unnecessarily, when, heaven knows, they are too full already.
Jus. B. At the instigation of this gentleman, you will escape this time unpunished; but woe betide you if I catch you here again. Let him go.
Dum. [Crossing to L.] Good day, your vorship; and if you sits there till I comes here again, vhy, nobody'll never fill that chair but yourself.
                                         [Exit, L. Bra. [To Officer.] Detain him in the outer office, and send for the pawnbroker without loss of time.
Jus. B. Bring in the prisoner charged with robbing Mr. Brandon of his watch. [Paul is brought on, R.] Now, Mr. Brandon, be kind enough to state your charge.
Bra. As I was leaving the theatre in company with my niece, I observed the prisoner and another man conversing together, and their eyes intently fixed on us. In passing them, my watch was stolen by one of the party, though I verily believe this man did not commit the offence.
Jus. B. It is the same thing, you know, Mr. Brandon. [75]   Well, fellow, what have you to say in your defence?
Paul. I positively declare my entire innocence of all knowledge of the transaction previous to being accused of the theft. My comrade might have stolen the watch, but I humbly suggest that that is exactly the very reason why I have not stolen it.
Jus. B. How long, fellow, have you known your companion?
Paul. About half a year.
Jus. B. And what is his name and calling?
Paul. [Hesitating.] I must decline answering that question.
Jus. B. A sad piece of business.
Bra. It is, indeed: however, I do not wish to be hard upon the young man. His youth is in his favour, and his offence is probably the consequence of evil company. I beg leave to suggest that, as he must be perfectly aware of the address of his friend, he shall receive a full pardon if he will immediately favour you with that information.
Paul. Notwithstanding the disinterested and Christian mercy of Mr. Brandon, sir, I am determined I will not meanly betray a comrade; at the same time I as boldly insist upon my innocence and uublemished respectability of character.

[Page 23]
Jus. B. Your name, young man—your name, you say, is Paul—Paul what?—You have many an alias, I'll be [100]   bound.
Paul. [Hesitatingly.] Paul Lobkins.
Jus. B. Lobkins! Lobkins! Come hither, Saunders —have we not that name down in our black books?
Sau. [Seated at the table, R.] So please your worship, there is one Peggy Lobkins who keeps a sort of flash ken, called the Mug, in Thames Court.
Jus. B. Oh, oh! [Winking at Brandon.] We must sift this a little. Pray, Mr. Lobkins, what relation is the good landlady of the Mug, in Thames Court, to yourself?
Paul. None at all, sir; she's only a friend.
                                         [A general laugh. Jus. B. Silence!—And I dare say, Mr. Paul Lobkins, that this friend of yours will vouch for your respectability.
Paul. I have no doubt of it, sir. [Another laugh.] Sir, however appearances may be against me, I still protest my innocence.
Jus. B. [Who has been watching Brandon's face, and observing his incredulous sneer.] What do you think of all this, Mr. B.?
Bra. That every thing concurs to support the opinion I had formed of this fellow,—young in years, but old in crime, I fear; and that you have but one course to pursue.
Jus. B. True; I shall commit you for three months to Bridewell.
Paul. For Heaven's sake, sir, reconsider your decision, [125]   or you may rue the hour when you let interest hold the scales of justice!
Jus. B. Does he threaten?—Take him away—I can't stay any longer, for my lunch is ready.
                                         [Getting up, and coming forward. Bra. The rascal has the perfect Old Bailey cut of countenance; and I do not doubt, if ever I live to be a judge, I shall also live to pass a very different sentence on him.
Paul. And if you should, sir, you, and you only, will be the cause, by consigning the hitherto-honest being on bare suspicion to the hateful companionship of guilt.— Should we meet again on a matter of life and death, I'll
[Page 24]
make you tremble in your judgment-seat at the recollection of this unjust hour!
[Exeunt all but Brandon and Justice Burnflat, R., and Saunders, L. Jus. B. Well, Mr. Brandon, I hope I have pleased you by my decision.
Bra. Nothing could be more wisely or impartially done.
                                         [Exit Justice Burnflat, R. Enter Saunders , L. Sau. Here's Mr. Swoppem, sir.
Bra. Admit him instantly. [Exit Saunders, L.] Now, then, to unravel this mystery.—Should it be—but, no, no—I dare not hope it! Enter Swoppem , L. I have sent for you, sir, to request you will give me every information on a subject that has been broached by a culprit here this morning.
Swo. [150]   I heard the whole business from the officer who was sent to require my attendance here, and assure you I know nothing of the party, and am at a loss to guess what he alludes to.
Bra. Come, come, sir, deal candidly with me, and any reward you choose to name shall be your's. I pledge you my honour.
Swo. Excuse me, sir, we don't take those things in.
Bra. No jesting, sir. Here is this purse of gold—it is your's if you will give me the necessary information; if not, I have the power of making you do so.
Swo. I shouldn't wish to offend you, sir; so I'll take the purse, and tell you all I know. Twenty years ago, sir, I met this Dummie Dunnaker at a public-house in Devereux Court, in company with two other men, and they sold me several articles in plate, ornaments, &c. The great bulk of those articles have, of course, all gone; but, wishing to show my fairness of dealing, I have been tumbling over my drawers, and found a stray trinket or two, not of sufficient worth to be reset or remodelled, nor of sufficient fashion to find a ready sale.
Bra. [Eagerly.] Where are they?
Swo. But am I quite safe? Shall I not be troubled hereafter?
Bra. On my soul and honour, you shall no

[Page 25]
Swo. [175]   Well, then, there they are. [Pulling out of the inside lining of his hat an old ring, a miniature set in silver, and a seal.] The ring has “W. B. to Julia” on it, you see, sir.
Bra. [Gazing at the ring with a dark and strange expression.] D—n her!
Swo. This miniature and seal—and that's all, sir.
Bra. [Aside.] The noble crest of my house!—Now for a warrant against this Dunnaker. Checking himself.] Why make all public if it can be avoided?—And it may be avoided. [To Swoppem.] Sir, you are safe whilst all circumstances relating to this affair remain secret.— Bring this Dummie to my chambers this evening. Away, and look that you obey me. [Exit Swoppem, L.] Thank heaven! that is accomplished, and my proud name will still pass to the grave unsullied. Now, then, to bring about the match with my niece, Lucy, and that politic favourite of the king's, the old Lord Mauleverer, and so raise her to a title, and make him the footstool of my own elevation to rank and power.
                                         [Exit. L. SCENE V. Interior of Bridewell, representing an Inner and Outer Court—the outer wall much higher than the inner, with part of the Prison joining, on which is the water-pipe. Men and Women beating hemp, picking oakum, and singing. CHORUS .— Air , “Pretty Polly, say.”
   All the live long day
   We vorks for our play,
And with hammer beats the hemp,
   Till ve're fit to faint avay. Enter Paul Clifford , brought in by Locks , the Turnkey, D. F. Locks. There, my covey, now you are among friends, and as rummy a set of pals as ever you opened your daylights on; having introduced you, I leave you to enjoy yourself.
                                         [Exit, D. F. Devil Tom. [To Paul.] Vell, my rum un, are you going to shove the tumbler for attempting to do a pauny, failing in which has saved your little colquarren?—Are you a tobyman or a cly faker?
Paul. (L.) [Angrily.] Neither.
Dev. T. (R.) Oh, this is one of your wirtuous coveys! We'll sarve him out.—Ramp! ramp!
                                         [Pinching him by the ear.
[Page 26]
[The Prisoners surround Paul, one pulling, another pinching him—one cuffing him before, another thrashing him behind, stealing his handkerchief, &c.—Paul defends himself in every way possible, but to no purpose. Enter Augustus Tomlinson , R., with a very grave aspect. Tom. [With great coolness and authority, and placing himself between Paul and his assailants.] Leave the lad alone, and go and be damned!
                                         [The Prisoners cease from their amusement. Dev. T. (R. corner.) [Slapping Paul on the back.] Split me, but you are an out-and-outer!—It was only a bit of a spree, and I hope it won't put your monkey up.
Paul. [Clenching his fist.] By hell, I'll—
Enter Locks , D. F. Locks. [Interfering.] Come, come, none of that ere, youngster.—Order, order! or I shall orders all of you to be locked up.—Can't you behave yourselves like gentlemen [25]   commoners?
All. So ve do.
Locks. Order, I say!—I'll be speaker here; and I'll let you know, that you members of the House of Correction ben't members of Parliament; and so I'll lock you two up. [Going to two who are quietly seated at the back, L. S. E.
First Prisoner. Vy, ve hav'nt moved off our seats.
Locks. No, but you've been a looking on, and that's just as bad; so off with you?
[They are taken off, L., and all except Tomlinson and Paul exeunt, R. U. E., laughing. Paul. (R.) Oh, for liberty once again, to revenge myself on society for this insult and cruelty!—My name is damned in worldly estimation, but they shall not crush me!—My heart feels as it would burst! [Tomlinson touches him on the arm—Paul gazes on him for some time.] Is that you, Mr. Tomlinson?—How glad I am to see you here!
Tom. (L.) And I should be very glad to see myself any where else. To a wise man all places are the same. so it has been said.—I don't believe it, Paul—I don't believe it. But a truce to reflection: how is our old friend, M'Grawler?
Paul. Oh! don't mention him. But tell me, Mr. Tomlinson, how came you hither?—I heard you had gone
[Page 27]
down to the north of England to fulfil a lucrative employment.
Tom. Possibly!—The world always misrepresents the [50]   actions of those who are constantly before it. But tell me your history.
Paul. As yet it has been but insipid, and not worth the listening to; but your's must be excessively entertaining.
Tom. If it is true, variety is pleasing, then must mine be entertaining indeed. At the time I made your acquaintance, I continued ostensibly my literary profession, but only as a mask for the labours I did not profess; for I had, a little time previous, encountered an old friend, named Pepper.
Paul. Pepper!
Tom. Who asked me to take a ride with him one night to Hounslow. I did so, and found a purse.
Paul. How fortunate!—Where?
Tom. In a gentleman's pocket. I was so pleased with my luck, that I went the same road twice a week, in order to see if I could pick up any more purses. In fine, I meditated much, and became a true philosopher,— namely, a practical one; and, to this end, formed one of a knot of Free agents. You know not what a glorious life is that of a highwayman.—But about six weeks ago I attempted to possess myself of a carriage, and sell it at a discount, and was sent hither on the misdemeanor by Justice Burnflat.
Paul. And where will all this end?—Let me entreat [75]   you to quit the course of vice—
Tom. For the path of virtue.—Where shall I find it? Neither in camp or court, law or state.—My theory always bears a reference to the politics of the day in which I cloak my rascalities.—Cheaters of the public on false pretences, I term, “moderate Whigs;” bullying demanders of your purse, “high Tories;” and thieving in gangs, “the effect of the spirit of party.” But to business —come here—closer: if I show you the means of escaping from this place, will you avail yourself of it, and lend me your assistance?
Paul. Joyfully.
Tom. You see that pipe, that, skirting the wall, passes over the door.—By the help of the skirting-board above, a dexterous and nimble man might readily convey himself along the pipe to the summit of the wall, where it
[Page 28]
finds a sequel in another pipe that descends to the ground on the other side. Now, on this opposite side is the garden of the prison, and if the watchman here were out of the way, once there, we are safe.
Paul. But that is not all; for, even if there were no watchman, there is a terrible wall beyond, which seems to have no pipe, save a perpendicular one, that a man must have the legs of a fly to be able to climb.
Tom. Nonsense!—I will show you how to climb the [100]   stubbornest wall in Christendom, if one has but the coast clear.—This cord, attached to a large stone, thrown over that wall, and drawn to the tether of the cord to which it is fastened, will necessarily hitch against the projection that overhangs either side of the said wall, and by this means raise yourself up on one side, and lower yourself on the other. Bless you, I have studied these things both practically and theoretically.—So, you see, the only obstacle is the watchman—the watchman we must—
Paul. What?
Tom. I have been thinking, Paul, whether it would be consistent with virtue, and that strict code of morals by which all my actions are regulated, to—slay the watchman.
Paul. Good heavens!
Tom. [Without heeding Paul.] And I have decided that the action would be perfectly justifiable.
Paul. [Recoiling from him.] Villain!
Tom. [Going on in the same tone.] But opinion does not always influence conduct; and, although it may be virtuous to murder the watchman, I have not the heart to do it.
                                         [Exit, L. Enter Mrs. Lobkins and Locks , D. F. Locks. There he stands—so look sharp.
Mrs. L. (L.) Oh, Paul, thou hast brought thy pigs to a fine market!
Paul. (R.) [Half jest—half earnest.] [125]   'Tis a market proper for pigs, dear dame; for, of all others, it is the spot where a man learns to take care of his bacon.
Mrs. L. Hold your tongue!—What business has you to gabble on so while you are in limbo?
Paul. Ah, dear dame! we can't help these rubs and tumbles on our road to preferment.
Mrs. L. Road to the scragging-post!—What, you is merry, is you?—Why does you not weep?—Your heart
[Page 29]
is as hard as a brick-bat; it looks quite unnatural and hyena-like to be so devil-me-carish.
                                         [Bursts into tears. Paul. Nay, nay, we cannot mend the matter by crying. Suppose you see what can be done for me—I dare say you may manage to soften the justice's sentence by a little oil of palms.
Mrs. L. I have tried, Paul, every means in my power, but the justice was deaf to all my entreaties.
Paul. [Aside.] Then there is but one course left.
Mrs. L. Buss me, Paul, buss me, and I'll go and try again; and here, my lad, here's summat for you in the meanwhile, a drop o' the cretur to preach comfort to your poor stomach—hush! smuggle it, or they'll see you —oh, dear! oh, dear!
                                         [Forgetting what she is about, drinks it herself. Locks. Come, mother, you must cut it short.
Mrs. L. Well, good bye, Paul—good bye, good bye; [150]   heaven bless you, and, if love or money can shorten your confinement, neither shall be wanting.
                                         [Exeunt Mrs. Lobkins and Locks, D. F. Paul. Heaven bless you, dame—I'll be hanged (humph! the denunciation is prophetic) if I don't feel as grateful to the old lady for her care of me, as if she had never illused me.
Enter Augustus Tomlinson , L. Tom. We have nothing to dread from the watchman's vigilance; he has promised, for certain con-si-de-ra-ti-ons, to allow me to knock him down; he has also promised to be so much hurt as not to be able to move until we are over both walls. One main difficulty now, then, is the first step—namely, to climb the pipe unperceived.
Paul. As to that, I think we may manage the first ascent with less danger than you imagine: a dense fog is coming on.
Tom. As dark as if all the negroes in Africa had been stewed into air. Tell me, my dear fellow, what you intend to do when you get out? I suppose you will decide upon taking to the road.
Paul. It may appear very odd to you, but, somehow or other, I have doubts whether thieving be really the honestest profession I could follow.
Tom. All crime and all excellence depend on a good choice of words: if you take money from the public and say you have robbed, you have indubitably committed.
[Page 30]
[175]   great crime; but, if you do the same, and say you have been relieving the necessities of the poor, you have done an excellent action; if, in afterwards dividing the money, you say you have been sharing booty, you have committed an offence against the laws of your country; but if you observe you have been sharing with your friends the gains of your industry, you have performed one of the noblest actions of humanity. To knock a man on the head is neither virtuous nor guilty, but it depends on the language applied to the action to make it murder or glory. Why not say, then, you have testified the courage of a hero, rather than the atrocity of the ruffian. This is clear, is it not?
Paul. It seems so.
Tom. If you want to rectify an abuse, those in power call you disaffected. Oppression is order—extortion is religious establishments—and taxes are the blessed constitution.
Paul. There is very little doubt but you are wrong; but, if you are, so are all the rest of the world.
Enter Watchman , R. Wat. Now, my rum ones, now's your time; all snug and the coast clear.
Tom. Then, Paul, do you start first, whilst I knock down the watchman. There, there are your ten guineas.
Wat. Now, then—to make all right, just tie my hands behind me, and cram this vipe in my mouth.
Tom. [200]   Oh, thou type of mankind in all its various motions, hadst thou been free from bribery and corruption, thou wouldst have stood alone among thy species, and outfaced the state in virtuous integrity.
                                         [Paul Clifford ascends, creeps along the pipe, and gains the wall—Augustus Tomlinson rather more clumsily follows, his foot slips, and he is all but over—he extends his hands involuntarily, and catches Paul by the leg—Paul then descends to the ground on the other side, appearing to let himself drop. Tom. Hurt?
Paul. [Without.] No.
Tom. Before descending from “this bad eminence,” I must know the extent of danger, being even more willing “to bear those ills I have than fly to others that I know not of.”

[Page 31]
                                         [Music—Air, “Over the hills and far away”—Tomlinson descends —the stone is then seen to be thrown over the outward wall, and they appear to ascend by the aid of the rope only, Tomlinson first, who holds it firm for Paul—they then remove the stone, and descend on the other side in the same manner—when out of sight, the Watchman gets up, staggers into the doorway, and the alarm is given—Locks and all the prisoners rush on—Locks fires—the bell is rung and the curtain drops, the prisoners shouting.

END OF ACT I.
ACT II. SCENE I. A wild woody Country—the moon seen shimmering through the trees— Music —Air “Fill every glass.” Long Ned and Augustus Tomlinson discovered—Tomlinson examining his pistols, and Long Ned tightening the girth of his horse. Ned. [Singing.] Let me the canikin clink, &c.
Tom. 'Sdeath, Ned, why cannot you stifle your love for the fine arts at a moment like this? Recollect we are not at Gentleman George's now.
Ned. The more's the pity, Augustus; a nice long night, like this, is made on purpose for drinking.                                          [Yawning.] Hang it, I wish the captain would come.
Tom. Tell me, Ned, what do you think of the new tenant Lovett has put in the Red Cave?
Ned. Oh, I have strange doubts there,—I don't half like it; consider, the cave is our strong hold, and ought only to be known—
Tom. To men of tried virtue—I agree with you.
Ned. Tomlinson, how came you by so much learning?
Tom. Oh, hang it, I was brought up like the captain, to a literary way of life.
Ned. That's what makes you thick with him. I suppose. Do you recollect what a poor way he was in the night you brought him to Gentleman George's, and now he's the Captain Crank of the gang.
Tom. The gang! the company, you mean. Gang, indeed! one would think you were speaking of a knot
[Page 32]
of pickpockets. Hist! see my horses' ears! some one is coming, keep watch.
                                         [They retire. Enter Dr. Slopperton , L. Dr. S. [25]   Well, I have got the tithe-money of Farmer Slowforth, and have been thinking, as I cut across the fields towards home, how I should lay it out. [Ned and Tomlinson advance on each side of him, unseen.] First, there's the topaz cross for my wife, Mrs. Slopperton; next, six dozen more of Madeira; and the remainder, which will be about one pound eighteen, I think I shall divide among thirty poor families on the common—that is, if the apples in my back garden are not feloniously abstracted.
Tom. (R.) Excellent, charitable man.
                                         [The Doctor, seeing Tomlinson, bows, and, turning from him, sees Ned, and bows. Ned. (L.) Well, Augustus, as you are such a moral dog, he is more in your line than mine,—so I shall leave him to you.
                                         [Exit over the gate, L. S. E. Tom. [Very politely.] Pray, sir, will you tell me the way to the church.
Dr. S. Yes, sir: you must first turn to the right, and then to the left, and then to the right again—the best way is very crooked.
Tom. Ah, sir, indeed! Your ways are crooked, mine are straight-forward; and so— [Seizing him by the collar.] your money or your life!
Dr. S. I have none.
Tom. What a divine untruth! You've been collecting tithe, and I am collecting toll; so out with the first-fruits of your this day's labour, a portion of which was to have [50]   saved your apples.
Dr. S. Oh, my wife's cross!
Tom. Is she? then to save you further trouble in this world, I think, doctor, I shall put an end to an existence derogatory to yourself and useless to others.
                                         [Exit Dr. Slopperton, running, R. Enter Paul Clifford , quickly, over the gate, R. 3d E., and Long Ned , L. U. E. Both. Ha, Lovett! [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha!
Paul. (C.) How are you, my merry men?
Ned. (L.) What news?
Paul. Brave news! look to it. My Lord Mauleverer and his carriage will be by in ten minutes, at most. Ned,
[Page 33]
you recollect the beautiful girl I was admiring when you stole the watch for which I suffered.
Ned. Well?
Paul. I have beheld her this evening again, walked with her, talked with her, sung to her, and she to me.
Tom. (R.) Talking of women, what say you to a trip to Bath after this night's adventure; and, for the novelty of the thing, see what we can do, in an honest way, by attacking the hearts of rich heiresses, miserly old maids, and warm widows? It would be a charity to the poor females, and “charity covers a multitude of sins.”
Ned. Do, Lovett, do. I think I shall be able to do a bit of connubial in style: it is not often they see such a figure as this—stap my vitals, and with these locks.
Tom. Yes, Locke on the Human Understanding.
Paul. [75]   Well, and since you wish it, and we are grown rather notorious in this part of the country, e'en let it be so; and now for my lord.
Tom. Bravo! are you sure our noble friend will soon be at hand?
Paul. Certain; I have just had all my intelligence confirmed. I despatched old Bags to wait for him where he changes horses, and be sure that he'll play him some trick.
Ned. Hush! I hear the whir of wheels.
Paul. Hark forward! Yoix, my boys!
Ned. Whist, captain! let us conduct ourselves like gentlemen; it is only your low fellows who get into such confoundedly high spirits: men of the world, like us, should do every thing as if their hearts were broke.
Tom. Melancholy ever cronies with sublimity, and courage is sublime.
Paul. Now for the hedge: you, Ned, stop the horses; you, Augustus, bully the post-boys; leave me to do the rest.
Ned. As agreed: now look at me.
                                         [Music—Air, “Let us take the Road”—they lie in ambush. Enter the Carriage of Lord Mauleverer, L. U. E.—Long Ned stops the horses—Tomlinson presents his pistol at Smoothson , who is on the box—Paul opens the door, and Lord Mauleverer descends the steps—Tomlinson drags Smoothson into the corner, L., presents his pistols, he falls backwards, and Tomlinson seats himself on his stomach Paul (R. C.) I am sorry to oblige your lordship to leave your carriage. Do not be alarmed, my lord, you
[Page 34]
are perfectly safe: we only require your watch and purse.
Lord M. (C.) Really, sir, your request is so modest, [100]   that I were worse than cruel to refuse you. My purse is not very full, and you may as well have it as one of my rascally duns; but my watch I have a love for, and—
Paul. I understand you, my lord. What do you value your watch at?
Lord M. Humph! to you it may be worth some twenty guineas.
Paul. Allow me to see it.
Lord M. Your curiosity is extremely gratifying.
                                         [Handing him the watch. Tom. [Smoothson attempts to rise.] Lie still, sir—lie still, I beseech you; all wise men are fatalists—and no proverb is so pithy as that which says, “What can't be cured must be endured.” Lie still, and reflect.
Paul. Your lordship was too modest in your calculation. Your taste reflects greater credit on you: allow me to assure you that your watch is worth fifty guineas, to us at least. To show you I think so most sincerely, I will either keep it, and we will say no more on the matter—or I will return it to you, upon your word and honour, that you will give me a check for fifty guineas, payable by your real banker to bearer for self. Take your choice—it is quite immaterial to me.
Lord M. Upon my honour, your self-possession is quite admirable. I see you know the world.
Paul. Your lordship flatters me. [Bowing.] How do [125]   you decide?
Lord M. Why, is it possible to write drafts without ink, pen, and paper?
Paul. I always carry those things about me, in case of accidents. Will you hold your pistols, my lord, that I took from your carriage, whilst I examine my pockets. [While Paul searches his pockets, Lord Mauleverer presents one of the pistols at his head, pulls the trigger, and the powder flashes in the pan—Paul, without changing countenance, draws forth a small ink-bottle, and, placing a pen in it, hands it to his lordship, with great sangfroid.] Would you like, my lord, to try the other pistol? If not, here is the back of a letter, on which you can write the draft.
Lord M. [Taking the pen and writing.] Well, I am not a man apt to become embarrassed in any thing—save my circumstances. But my failure in shooting this fellow,
[Page 35]
and his damnable coolness, not a little discomposes and confuses me.
                                         [Handing the draft to Paul, who, after examining it, bows coolly, and returns the watch. Paul. [To Smoothson, who is allowed to rise.] What have you got about you, belonging to your master?
Smo. Only his pills, your honour, which I forgot to put in the—
Paul. Give them to me. [Smoothson gives them.] One, two—four—twelve—aha! are these your pills, my lord?
Lord M. They are.
Paul. My lord, I see you are in a high state of fever: you were a little delirious just now, when you snapped a pistol in your friend's face. Permit me to recommend [150]   you a prescription—swallow off all these pills.
Lord M. Good heavens! what do you mean? Twelve of those pills would kill a man.
Paul. Hear him! [Laughing.] What, my lord, would you rebel against your doctor? Fie, fie—be persuaded.
                                         [Holding the box to him. Lord M. [Snatching the box and throwing it away.] Do your worst, rascal! But, if you leave me alive, you shall repent this outrage you have offered to one of his majesty's household; and now, for heaven's sake, let me go; and, if you must kill somebody, there's my servant—he's paid for it.
                                         [All laugh. Paul. Adieu, my lord—let me give you a piece of advice: whenever you get out at a country inn, and stay half an hour while your horses are changing, take your pistols with you, or you may chance to have the charge drawn.
                                         [Exit Lord Mauleverer, into the carriage. Tom. [To Smoothson.] And now, my friend, touching these pills—swallow me these pills, and you will never have served your master better in your life. Come, swallow. [Smoothson swallows one with horrid grimaces.] Another!
Smo. (L. C.) One's a dose!
Tom. (C.) Swallow that pill or this.
                                         [Holding up his pistol—Smoothson swallows another. Paul. (L. C.) Let the poor devil go—there—there, be off to your master, or he'll start without you. [Smoothson holds out his purse to Paul.] [175]   Rogues should never prey on each other, my good fellow—you rob your master, so do we—let each keep what he has got. [Smoothson mounts the box.] Ned, let the carriage go free. Adieu, my lord.

[Page 36]
Tom. and Ned. Adieu, my lord! Hurra! hurra! hurra!
                                         [They salute the carriage as it drives off, and the scene closes. Music—Air, “Let us take the road.” SCENE II. —An Apartment in Brandon's House, at Bath. Enter Brandon and Lucy , L. Bra. My dear Lucy, it has been the professional study of my life to discover a man's character; but you excel me by intuition, if you can tell me whether there be sincerity in a courtier's character, at the first interview you have with him.
Lucy. Nevertheless, I am sure of my opinion, and I will tell you one instance I observed among a hundred: Lord Mauleverer is rather deaf, and he imagined, in conversation, that my father said one thing—Lord Mauleverer chimed in with him in the warmest manner in the world; but suddenly, finding that the sentiments he so lauded were exactly those my father least favoured, he wheeled round again dexterously and gracefully, I allow —condemned all that he had before extolled, and extolled all that he before abused.
Bra. And is that all, Lucy? Why, that is what every one does, only some more gravely than others—Mauleverer in society; I at the bar; the minister in Parliament; friend to friend; lover to mistress; mistress to lover: half of us are employed in saying white is black, and the other half in swearing black is white. The fool changes, and is a liar; the clever man makes the colours change, and is a genius.
Lucy. Yet I can't see the necessity of seeming to [25]   agree with people that would be just as well pleased if you differed from them civilly, and with respect.
Bra. No, Lucy; to be liked, it is not necessary to be anything but compliant; lie, cheat, make every word a snare, and every act a forgery; but never contradict: agree with people, and you make a couch for you in their hearts. I shall this night witness your debût in the great world; and I shall go back to my dry pursuits, with the satisfaction of thinking our old and withered genealogical tree has put forth one blossom worthy of its freshest day.

[Page 37]
Lucy. [Shaking her finger with an arch smile.] Uncle!
Bra. And why that look, Lucy?
Lucy. Because—because—well, no matter! you have been bred to the trade in which you say yourself men tell untruths for others, till they lose all truth for themselves.
Bra. Now, Lucy, go and prepare to accompany me to this grand rout, with your father. [Exit Lucy, R.] Women are first what nature makes them, and that is good— next, what we make them, and that is evil! Now, could I persuade myself that we ought to be nice as to the use we put these poor puppets to, I should shrink from enforcing the destiny which is marked for this girl. But that is a pitiful consideration, and he is but a silly player who loses his money for the sake of preserving his counters. [50]   So the young lady must go as another score to the fortunes of William Brandon. After all, who suffers? Not she; she will have wealth, rank, honour: I shall suffer, to yield so pretty and pure a gem to the coronet of—saugh! how I despise that dog! but how could hate, crush, mangle him, could I believe that he despised me! Could he do so? Umph! No; I have resolved myself that is impossible. Well, let me hope that matrimonial point will be settled; and now let me consider what next step I shall take for myself! myself!—ay—only myself! with me perishes the last male of Brandon.
Enter Barlow , L. Bar. Lord Maulverer, Sir!
Enter Lord Mauleverer , L. Bra. Ah, my dear Lord Mauleverer! I am delighted to see you.
                                         [Exit Barlow, L. Lord M. And I you, Brandon.
Bra. Have you heard any thing more, my lord, of the new cabinet that is forming?
Lord M. Only that Dauville is to come into office.
Bra. You astonish me—he has very little power—has he any talent?
Lord M. Yes, one very great one—acquired, though—
Bra. What is it?
Lord M. A pretty wife.
Bra. [Abruptly.] My Lord! [Mauleverer is confused— after a short pause, Brandon proceeds.] Tell me, you who [75]   necessarily know every thing, whether the cabinet really
[Page 38]
is settled—whether you are to have the garter, and I— the judgeship.
Lord M. Why so, I imagine, it will be arranged; viz. if you will consent to hang up the rogues, instead of living by the fools.
Bra. One may unite both! but I believe it is, in general, vice versâ ; for we live by the rogues, and it is only the fools we are able to hang up. You ask me, if I will take the judgeship: I would not forsake my present career, despite of all the obstacles that now incumber it—no, I would rather cut my hand off, did I think that this miserable body would suffer me for two years longer to pursue it.
Lord M. But the judgeship is not an easy sinecure.
Bra. No, but there is less demand on the mind in that station than in my present one; besides, I have the positive and pledged, though secret, promise of his Majesty and the premier, to give me the first vacancy among the chiefs—the title might go (at least by an exertion of interest) to the eldest son of my niece, in case she married a commoner; or [Pausing.] her second son, in case she married a peer.
Lord M. Ay—true, and your charming niece, Brandon, would be worthy of any honour, either to her children [100]   or herself; you do not know how struck I was with her—she may be Lady Mauleverer as soon as she pleases.
Bra. Nay, now let us be serious, and talk of the judgeship.
                                         [Affecting to treat the proposal as a jest. Lord M. By the soul of Sir Charles Brandon, I am serious; and as a proof of it, I hope you'll let me pay my respects to your niece to-day—not with my offer in my hand, yet—for it must be a love-match on both sides. [Conceitedly.] As you say, the second son of your niece might inherit the dignity of the peerage.
Bra. Well, I have decided on my change of life.
Lord M. So have I on my change of opinion, to keep in with the new administration. I will tell you what opinions seem to me like.
Bra. What?
Lord M. Trees! If they can be made serviceable by standing, don't part with a stick; but when they are of that growth that sell well, or whenever they shut out a fine prospect, cut them down, and pack them off, by all manner of means. I wonder whether there ever existed
[Page 39]
a minister who cared three straws for the people? Many care for their party, but as for the country—
Bra. It is all fiddlestick.
Lord M. Right, it is all fiddlestick, as you truly express [125]   it—king, constitution, and church for ever—which, being interpreted, means, first, king or crown influence, judgeships, and garters; secondly, constitution, or fees to the lawyers, places to the statesmen, laws for the rich, and game-laws for the poor; thirdly, church, or livings for our younger sons, and starvings for their curates.
Bra. [Laughing.] Ha, ha! We know human nature.
Lord M. And how it may be gulled. Well, remember me to your niece, and I hope it will not be long before you hail her as your friend's bride.
Bra. [Aside.] Bride, et cetera. But, mark me, my dear lord, do not be too sure—she is a singular girl, and of more independence than the generality of women.
Lord M. [Smiling conceitedly.] I must take my chance.
Bra. [Aside.] The hoary coxcomb—now will his own folly spoil all. Well, my lord, excuse me for a moment, till I arrange for my niece and brother's departure for the ball, whither, if you please, I will accompany you.
Lord M. Most willingly. [Exit Brandon, R.] I can't laugh at that man, though he has much that I should laugh at in another; and 'faith! there is one little matter, the selling his mistress to me, I might well scorn him for, if I were not a philosopher. 'Tis a pretty girl, his niece, and, with proper instructions, might do one credit; [150]   besides, she has sixty thousand pounds ready money, and i'saith! I have not a shilling. In all probability she will be the lawyer's heiress, and he must have made at least as much again as her portion; nor is he, poor devil, a very good life. Moreover, if he rise to the peer-age —and the second son—well, well, it will not be such a bad match for the gay Lord Mauleverer either.
SONG.— Lord Mauleverer . Air —“Triumph of Friendship,” in Moore's National Melodies.

“A Temple to Cupid, said Flora, enchanted,
   I'll build in the garden, the thought is divine!
Her Temple was built—and she now only wanted
   A picture of Cupid to place o'er the shrine.
[Page 40]

She flew to a painter, who soon set before her
   A Cupid, the loveliest his art could invent;
But so ragged his garb, that the youthful adorer
   Saw plainly this was not the idol she meant.

“Oh! never,” she cried, “could I think of enshrining
   A picture of one blind and in such a trim;
But you rich-clad god, upon velvet reclining,
   We'll make, if you please, sir, a Cupid of him.”
So the bargain was struck,—with the god of wealth laden,
   She joyfully flew to her shrine in the grove.
“Farewell,” said the painter, “you're not the first maiden
   Forsook for great Plutus the little god Love.” SCENE III. A Ball-Room at Bath—the Master of the Ceremonies and Guests discovered, moving about—a reel is danced, &c. Enter Lucy, 'Squire Brandon , and Lady Backbite , L. U. E. Lady B. I am so delighted to have met you here, Miss Brandon; but I'd have you be very cautious who you associate with, for Bath is such a scandalous place— every body abusing every body—a thing I abominate. Why, I declare, there's the Honourable Miss Pointer, quizzing the two Miss Timms's turned-in toes—it's too bad, isn't it?—Ah, if she could see with other people's eyes, she would not look in the glass very often. I hope you are quite well this evening, Miss Pointer?— Oh, Sir Tom, how d'ye do? how d'ye do?
Enter Paul Clifford, Augustus Tomlinson , and Long Ned , dashingly dressed, R. U. E. Lady B. Who can these be? I never saw them before —they must be great people—they have all the airs of persons of quality. Dear, dear! how odd that I shouldn't know them—who are they?
                                         [Going up to the Honourable Miss Pointer. Miss P. Can't tell—can't tell—never saw them before.
                                         [A general buzz round the room, everybody seeming to inquire who Paul, Tomlinson, and Ned are, who are laughing rather boisterously. Ned. [Putting his hair in order, and finding his ruffle torn.] The cock of that confounded—
                                         [Tucking it up, and adjusting a large brooch. Paul. Hush!
Tom. Don't let a bit of torn lace ruffle the natural equanimity of your temper, thou modern Hyperion.

[Page 41]
                                         [Ned pulls out an elegant snuff-box, and surveys his dress— the Master of the Ceremonies comes down, R., and bows, which Paul gracefully returns. M. of C. [Aside.] What an elegant bow. You would like to dance probably, gentlemen?
Paul. You're very good; and, for my part, I shall be extremely indebted to you for the exercise of your powers in my behalf.
M. of C. [Bowing.] [25]   Have you been long in Bath, sir?
Paul. No, indeed! we arrived this evening.
M. of C. From London?
Paul. No; we made a little tour across the country.
M. of C. Oh! very pleasant, this fine weather.
Paul. Yes; especially in the evening.
M. of C. Oho! romantic!—Why, the nights are agreeable, and the moon is particularly favourable to us.
Paul. Not always.
M. of C. (R. C.) I wonder who they are! Pray, sir, is that gentleman—that tall gentleman, any way related to Lord James Elephantwo?
Paul. (C.) Not in the least; but he is of a family that have made a noise in the world, though he (as well as my other friend), is merely a commoner .
M. of C. Nothing, sir, can be more respectable than a commoner of family.
                                         [Bowing. Paul. [Starting at the sight of Lucy, who is at the upper end of the room.] Heavens! is that Miss Brandon?
M. of C. It is, indeed, that lovely young lady. I suppose that you being blessed with her acquaintance, do not need an introduction?
Paul. Humph!—No. Perhaps you had better present me.
M. of C. By what name?
Paul. Clifford—Captain Clifford. [The Master of the Ceremonies goes towards Lucy—Paul turning to his companions in a commanding yet careless tone.] [50]   Harkye, gentlemen, oblige me by being as civil and silent as you are able, and don't thrust yourselves upon me as you are accustomed to do.
                                         [Follows the Master of the Ceremonies. Ned. (R. C.) Our friend grows mighty imperious.
Tom. (C.) 'Tis the way with your rising geniuses Suppose we have our cotillion, and then go to the cardroom, and get up a rubber.
Ned. Well thought of. [Yawning.] And I wish nothing
[Page 42]
worse to those who try our rubbers, than that they may be well cleaned by them.
                                         [They dance a cotillion, and then exeunt arm-in-arm, L. S. E. A Cotillion .—Enter Lord Mauleverer , L., during the dance, and speaking through the Music. Lord M. I wonder whom she is dancing with!—Ah, if Tarquin had but known women as well as I do, he would have had no reason to be rough with Lucretia. How cursedly pleased she looks—by heaven, that stolen glance! and he—ha! how firmly he holds that little hand! I think I see him paddle with it; and then the dog's earnest, intent look, and she all blushes, though she dare not look up to meet his gaze, feeling it by intuition. Oh, the demure, modest, shame-faced hypocrite! how silent she is! She can prate enough to me. I would give my promised garter if she would but talk to him—talk—talk, laugh, prattle—only simper in heaven's name, and I shall be happy. But that bashful, blushing silence—it is insupportable. [The dance finished.] [75]   Thank heaven, the dance is over. I have not felt such pain since the last nightmare I had after dining with her father off boiled beef, which nearly carried me off very suddenly, and I expected the verdict would have been “Died of the visitation of beef, John, Earl of Mauleverer.” [Going to Lucy, who is leaning on the arm of Paul.] I hope the charming Miss Brandon enjoys the festivities of the evening?
Lucy. (R. C.) Oh, my lord, I cannot express how much I am gratified.
Lord M. (L.) Will Miss Brandon now allow me the agreeable duty of conducting her to her father?
Lucy. [Timidly.] I believe that, according to the laws of the room, I am engaged to this gentleman for another dance.
Paul. An honour that all must envy, but none can estimate more than I do. [Lord Mauleverer surveys Paul with an air of suspiciousness, and Paul returning the look with interest.] I believe, Miss Brandon, the dance is about to begin.
                                         [They retire up, C.—the Master of the Ceremonies comes down, L., and bows very profoundly to Lord Mauleverer. Lord M. Aha! My dear Mr.—Lycurgus of the room, can you inform me who that young man is, now dancing with Miss Brandon?

[Page 43]
M. of C. Oh, it is a Captain Clifford, my lord; has your lordship never met him?
Lord M. Never: who is he?—One under your especial [100]   patronage
                                         [Smiling. M. of C. Nay, indeed, [Simpering.] I scarcely know who he is yet. The captain only made his appearance here to-night for the first time. He came with two other gentlemen—ah, there they are.
Enter Long Ned , swaggering, and Tomlinson , from the card-room—Lord Mauleverer laughs at Ned's manner. M. of C. That fine-looking man seems disposed to give himself airs.
Lord M. Judging from the gentleman's rubicund appearance, I should imagine that he was more accustomed to give himself thorough draughts.
M. of C. Ah! they seem real dashers, my lord.
Lord M. Dashers! true haberdashers! Well, well— it would be but kind to seek out Brandon, and hint to him in what company his niece seems to have fallen.
                                         [Exit, L. S. E.—The dance finishes, and Paul is leading Lucy to a seat, when Ned taps him on the shoulder—he turns quickly, and Ned puts his finger to his nose. Paul. How now? Did I not tell thee to put that huge bulk of thine as far from me as possible?
Ned. Umph! [Grunting.] if these are my thanks, I may as well keep my kindness to myself: but know you, my kid, that Lawyer Brandon is here, peering through the crowd to catch a glimpse of that woman's face of thine.
Paul. Ha, begone, then! I will meet you without the rooms immediately. [Turning to Lucy, and bowing very low, to hide his face from Brandon, who enters, L. U. E.] I trust, madam, I shall have the honour to meet you again. Is it, if I may be allowed to ask, with your celebrated uncle that you are staying? or—
Lucy. [125]   With my father: but my uncle is here, though, I fear, he leaves us to-morrow.
                                         [Paul looks pleased, bows, and recedes into the crowd—Brandon comes down to Lucy. Tom. [Taking up a gold-headed cane, and weighing it across his finger.] Alas! among our supporters, we often meet heads as heavy, but of what different metal!
                                         ['Squire Brandon advances. 'Squire B. Sir, my cane.
Tom. Cane, sir! ah, I am so absent! Here is thy
[Page 44]
cane. Only think of my carrying off the man's cane, Ned—ha, ha, ha!
                                         [Exeunt Ned and Tomlinson, L. U. E. 'Squire B. Absent, indeed! Body o' me! but it was the cane that was about to be absent.
                                         [Country dance, in which Lord Mauleverer and Lucy, 'Squire Brandon and Lady Backbite, &c., join, and the scene closes. SCENE IV. —Interior of a mean-looking Public-House, with tables, benches, &c. Enter Mrs. Pipes , R. Mrs. P. I must arrange every thing—my common customers —eh! here come some of them.
Enter Paul Clifford, Long Ned , and Augustus Tomlinson , L. Paul. Are the other gentlemen come yet?
Mrs. P. No.
Ned. (L.) Bring the pipes and the lush, old blone. [Throwing himself on a bench.] This is a devilish sight better than strutting about that confounded ball-room, with a rose stuck in one's button-hole; don't you think so, captain
Paul. (R.) Pish!
Ned. Look you, Mr. Lovett: if you ride the high horse with me, split my extremities, if I don't have satisfaction.
Tom. (C.) Psha! for companions to quarrel is extremely immoral. Don't you see, the captain is in a reverie? What great man ever loves to be interrupted in his meditations?
Ned. Captain, indeed! [Muttering, and looking wrathfully at Paul, who pays no attention to him.] For my part, I cannot conceive what was the matter with us, when we chose this green slip of the gallows-tree for our captain of the district. To be sure, he did very well at first— and that robbery of the old lord was not ill planned—but lately—
Tom. Nay, nay, the nature of man is prone to discontent. Allow that our present design of setting up the gay Lothario, and trying our chances at Bath for an heiress, [25]   is owing as much to Lovett's promptitude as to our invention.
Ned. And what good will come of it? [Lighting his pipe.] Answer me that? Did not I walk three times up and down that great room, without being a jot the better for it?

[Page 45]
Tom. Ah! but you know not how many secret conquests you may have made: you cannot win a prize by looking upon it.
Ned. Humph!
Tom. As for the captain's partner [Delighted at exciting Ned's jealousy.] , I will turn Tory if she be not already half in love with him.
Ned. I am not sure of that, Mr. Tomlinson. [Sourly eying his comrade.] Some women may be caught by a smooth skin and a showy manner; but real masculine beauty—eyes—colour—hair—Mr. Tomlinson, must ultimately make its way. So, hand me the brandy, and cease your jaw.
Tom. Well, well; I'll give you a toast—the prettiest girl in England—and that's Miss Brandon.
Paul. [Starting from the bench.] You shall give no such toast, sir. What the devil is Miss Brandon to you? And now, Ned [Seeing Ned looking at him with an unfavourable aspect.], here's my hand; it shall not be my fault, gentlemen, if we have not a merry evening.
Ned and Tom. [50]   Bravo, bravo! well said; here come some of our friends.
Enter Attie, Bags, Scarlet Jem, Gallows Charley, Mobbing Francis , &c., noisily into the apartment—Tom announces each as they enter, L. Paul. [Seated in a large arm chair at the head of the table.] What, my old friend, Bags! You have not come empty-handed, I will swear: your honest face is like the table of contents to the good things in your pocket.
Bags. (R.) Ah, Captain Clifford [Shaking his head.] , I have seen the day when there was not a lad in England forked so largely, so comprehensively, like, as I did; but as King Lear says, at Common Garden, “I be's old now.”
Paul. But your zeal is as youthful as ever; I do not know to this day, throughout the three kingdoms, a neater, quieter, and more effective set of fingers, than Old Bags'.
All. True—true!
Paul. And now, gentlemen, let me hear your adventures, and rejoice our eyes with their produce. The gallant Attie shall begin.
Att. (L.) You sees, captain, that I am not addicted to much blarney—little cry and much wool is my motto.—
[Page 46]
At ten o'clock, a.m., saw the enemy in the shape of a Doctor of Divinity: “Blow me,” says I to Old Bags, “but I'll do his reverence!”—“Blow me,” says Old Bags, “but you sha'nt;—you'll have us scragged if you touches the church.”—“My grandmother!” says I.— [75]   Bags tells the pals—all in a fuss about it—what care I? I puts on a decent dress, and goes to the doctor as a decayed soldier, wot supplies the shops in the turning line. His reverence—a fat jolly dog as ever you see—was at dinner over a fine roasting pig; so I tells him I have some bargains at home for him;—so he comes with me to my house; but when I gets him into a lane, out comes my pops.—“Give up, doctor,” says I; “others must share the good of the church now.”—You has no idea what a row he made; but I did the thing, and there's an end on't.
All. Bravo, Attie!
Bags. [Emptying six pockets of all manner of things.] That's all, and it breaks my heart to think I have not forked more
                                         [Weeps. Paul. I love a warm-hearted enthusiasm.—May new cases never teach us to forget Old Bags!
All. Bravo! bravo!
Paul. What are you drinking, Bags?
Bags. Blue ruin.
                                         [Others place their spoil on the table. Paul. Gentlemen—
All. Hear! hear!
Paul. And now, friends and followers, gentlemen of the road, the street, the theatre, and the shop—prigs, tobymen, and squires of the cross, according to the laws of our society, I resign into your hands the power which [100]   I have borne with so much infirmity, it is true, but, at least, with a sincere desire to serve the cause with which you have entrusted me.
                                         [Great applause. Tom. (L. of Paul.) Gentlemen, life is short—why should speeches be long?—Gentlemen, I shall say but one word in favour of my excellent friend.—A prime minister is not more useful to his followers, or more burdensome to the public, than, I am proud to say, is Paul Lovett.—The man whom opposite parties unite in praising must have supereminent merit.—You all know, gentlemen, that our body has been long divided into two factions, each emulous which shall put the greatest number of fingers in the public pie.—In the language of the vulgar, the one faction would be called swindlers, and
[Page 47]
the other highwaymen.—I, gentlemen, who am fond of finding new names for things and persons, and am a bit of a politician, call the one Whigs and the other Tories. [Cheering.] Of the former body, I am esteemed no uninfluential member; of the latter faction, Mr. Bags is justly considered the most shining ornament.—Mr. Attie and Mr. Edward Pepper can scarcely be said to belong entirely to either: they unite the good qualities of both— British Compounds, some term them—I term them Liberal Aristocrats. [Cheers.] I now call upon you all, whig or swindler, tory or highwayman, British compounds or [125]   liberal aristocrats, to name me one man whom you will all agree to elect.
All. Lovett for ever!
Tom. Gentlemen, without another word, I propose as your captain Mr. Paul Lovett.
Gal. C. And I seconds the motion.
Paul. My gratitude is too great for utterance, but I thank you. [Mobbing Francis and Attie are quarrelling.] What means this noise?
Att. Here's Mobbing Francis, because I won't let him have a pinch of my pelf, swears he'll hit me a muffler.
Paul. Order, gentlemen, order!—On this paper you will see your destinations fixed.—Ned, [Giving money.] let flashes of lightning glare in the faces of all as they leave the house—And now, gentlemen, I'll give you a sentiment, by way of a spur: “Much sweeter than honey is other men's money.”
                                         [Music.—Air, “Fill Every Glass.”—The toast is drunk with enthusiasm, and the scene closes. SCENE V. —A View of Bath from the Hills. Enter Paul Clifford and Augustus Tomlinson , R. Tom. There are certain moments when we are like the fox in the nursery rhyme—“The fox had a wound, he couldn't tell where.”—We feel extremely unhappy, and we cannot tell why.
Paul. Right, Tomlinson.—And now tell me, my friend, what think you of our chance of success?—Shall we catch an heiress or not?
Tom. Why, really, women are like those calculations in arithmetic which one can never bring to an exact account. —For my part, I shall stuff my calves, and look
[Page 48]
out for a widow; you, my good fellow, seem to stand a good chance with Miss—
Paul. Oh, name her not!—Somehow or other, our's are not the lips by which her name should be breathed; and, faith, when I think of her, I do it anonymously.
Tom. What, have you ever thought of her before this evening?
Paul. Yes, for months.—You remember the night I was taken for the theft Ned had committed—at the theatre that night I beheld Miss Brandon.—Mind, if I speak of her by name, you must not; and, by Heaven— but I won't swear.—Before we robbed Lord Manleverer, I met her at the house of the magistrate, near Warlock. I accompanied her home; we formed the plan of a matrimonial [25]   speculation at Bath—I came hither—guess my surprise at seeing her.
Tom. And your delight at hearing she is as rich as she is pretty.
Paul. No: that thought gives me no pleasure.—You stare—I will try and explain.—You know, dear Tomlinson, I am not much of a canter, and yet my heart shrinks when I look upon that innocent face and hear that soft, happy voice, and think that my love to her can be only ruin and disgrace; nay, that my very address is contamination, and my very glance towards her an insult.
Tom. Hey-day! have you been under my instructions, and learned the true value of words, and can you have any scruples left on so easy a point of conscience? True, you may call your presenting yourself to her as an uprofessional gentleman, and so winning her affections, deceit; but why call it deceit, when a genius for intrigue is so much neater a phrase?—In like manner, by marrying the young lady, if you say you have ruined her, you justly deserve to be annihilated; but why not say you have saved yourself, and then, my dear fellow, you will have done the most justifiable thing in the world?
Paul. (R.) Pish, man, none of thy sophisms and sneers.
                                         [A laugh without. Tom. (L.) Let us fly on this day of spleen: “Man delights not me, nor woman either!”
Paul. [50]   Stay!—Surely, I recognize the voice of her— that voice which has already acquired over me an irresistible and bewitching power!
                                         [Tomlinson sighs and remains—Music.—Air, “When the Heart of a Man is depressed with Care.”
[Page 49]
Enter a Party of Ladies and Gentlemen, with Lucy Brandon, Lady Backbite , and 'Squire Brandon , L. 'Squire B. Ah, Captain Clifford, you here!—This is a pleasure I did not expect.—We have been seeing my brother off, and so came on the hill with a few friends, to enjoy the freshness of the breeze.
Paul. Miss Brandon is well, I hope?
Lucy. [Confused.] Quite, I thank you, sir.
Paul. [Aside.] How blush chases blush over the smooth and peach like loveliness of her cheek!
'Squire B. Well, captain, I shall leave Lucy to your charge.
                                         [He goes towards the rest of the party—Lucy and Paul are so embarraseed, that neither speak—Lucy, in playing with a flower, drops it, and both stooping at the same moment to recover it, their hands meet—Paul detains her hand, and respectfully raises it to his lips—the party are turning round at this moment, when Tomlinson, who has been watching, raises his arm, and attracts the attention of the party towards himself, and Paul and Lucy retire, R. Tom. [Pointing towards the city.] What a subject for contemplation!
Lady B. Very sensibly said, indeed, sir.
                                         [They all look at him. Tom. I never—I never see a great town from the top of a hill without thinking of an apothecary's shop.
Lady B. Lord, sir!
                                         [They all get round him. Tom. [Aside.] My end is gained, and Paul can now make love in quiet. [Aloud.] Of an apothecary's shop, ma'am.—There lie your simples, and your purges, and your cordials, and your poisons—all things to heal, and to strengthen, and to destroy.—There are drugs enough in that collection to save you—to cure you all; but none [75]   of you know how to use them, nor what medicine to ask for, nor what portions to take; so that the greater part of you swallow a wrong dose, and die of the remedy.
'Squire B. (L.) But if the town be the apothecary's shop, what, in the plan of your idea, stands for the apothecary?
Tom. (C.) The apothecary, sir, is the law—it is the law that stands behind the counter, and dispenses to each man the dose he should take.—To the poor it gives bad drugs gratuitously—to the rich, pills to stimulate the appetite; to the latter, premiums for luxury—to the
[Page 50]
former, only speedy refuges from life.—Alas! either your apothecary is but an ignorant quack, or his science itself is but in its cradle.—He relieves you, it is true, but of your money, not your malady; and the only branch of his profession in which he is an adept is that which enables him to bleed you.—Oh, mankind! what noble creatures you ought to be!—You have keys to all arts, all sciences, all mystery but one!—You have not a notion how you ought to be governed or to govern!—You are like a nosegay bought at Covent Garden—the flowers are lovely, the scent delicious. Mark that glorious hue— contemplate that bursting petal, how beautiful—how redolent of health, of nature!—Of the dew, and breath, and blessing of Heaven, are you all!—But as for the dirty piece of string that ties you together, one would think you [100]   had picked it out of the kennel!
                                         [Exit, R. Lady B. What an eccentric being—let us follow and hear more of him.
'Squire B. But where's Lucy?
Lady B. She is safe enough with Captain Clifford yonder. Come, come, or we shall lose him.
                                         [Exeunt after Tomlinson. Lord Mauleverer. (L.) [Speaking without.] Let the carriage wait for me.
Enter Lord Mauleverer , L. Lord M. So, Miss Brandon and her boorish father are indulging in the vulgar exercise of walking in the fields; but, as I am to play the lover, I must not stand upon trifles. Brandon says, I must dazzle her by splendour, give sumptuous entertainments, make it necessary for all the world to attend them, excluding, of course, this Captain Clifford. I shall then meet Miss Brandon without a rival. [Turns, and sees Paul and Lucy together.] Eh! what do I see! with the same dancing gentleman who last provoked my jealousy and wrath.
Enter 'Squire Brandon , R. Lord M. Ah, 'Squire! I have sought you, to offer an invitation to a fête I intend to give, and—and—who the deuce is Miss Brandon talking to?
'Squire B. Oh, a very charming young man, a Captain Clifford.
Lord M. Ay! Clifford! Clifford! I think common prudence requires that you should find out exactly who
[Page 51]
[125]   he is, especially as your daughter is evidently smitten with him. [Lord Mauleverer and 'Squire Brandon retire.
Enter Lucy , R. Lucy. Dear father, we wish you to join us. [Seeing Lord Mauleverer.] Lord Mauleverer here!
Lord M. At your service, Miss Brandon.
Enter Servant, L. Ser. These letters from your brother, sir, have been sent by express from his first stage on the road to London, and, thinking them of consequence, I brought them here.
Lucy. Should my uncle be ill—what is the matter, father?
'Squire B. (C.) Your uncle writes that he has received positive information very detrimental to the character of this Captain Clifford; and that if either you or I have the least regard for our respectability, we must avoid his society or leave Bath.
Lucy. What? [Aside.] Have I placed my affections upon a man of uncertain character? and yet, his tone— his manner. No, no; there can be no reason for shame in loving him: and yet, why does he never speak of his parents, his relations, his home? My uncle would not sure destroy a reputation, nor urge such decisive conduct on our parts, on slight grounds; and it would break his heart and my father's if I loved one whom they deemed unworthy.
Enter Paul , R. Paul. [150]   Miss Brandon, your carriage is at hand; will you allow me to hand you into it?
Lucy. [Coldly.] Lord Mauleverer will honour me by rendering me that assistance. [Lord Mauleverer comes for ward and offers his hand.] My heart will burst.
                                         [Exeunt Lucy, led off by Lord Mauleverer, L.—Paul stands stupified. 'Squire B. [Passing Clifford very abruptly.] Good day, captain.
                                         [Exit, L. Paul. Is this a dream? No, no, 'tis real, dreadfully real. What can it mean? am I betrayed?—If so, the life —but no, man cannot be so base. I begin to feel, for the first time in my life, that an equivocal character is at least no equivocal misfortune. And I have dared to address
[Page 52]
the accents of love to the pure and unsuspecting Miss Brandon; I have dared to hope she loved me—a wretch like me, born to misery, and doomed, perhaps, to die a felon's death.—Let me drown these thoughts amidst the riotings of guilty associates, or I shall go distracted.
Enter Augustus Tomlinson and Long Ned , R. Tom. Thou Alexander of Captains, old Bags has sent us word that certain officers have been seen at Bath, and certain kind inquiries have been set on foot, which portend no good to my sagacious self and the valorous Pepper.
Paul. You will leave the town instantly: go not for your lives to London, or to rejoin any of your comrades; ride for the Red Cave, there are provisions stored there —on the night of the second day from this I will join [175]   you.
Tom. Fortune frustrates our wisest schemes! Captain, will you produce the scanty wrecks of your wealth to supply our wants on the road? [Paul gives a purse.] “All your pretty ones?—Did you say all?” [Paul looks an answer—jingling the money, and looking at it with a parental air.] “Alas! regardless of their doom, the little victims play.”
Ned. Come along, Augustus; we are certainly scented here, and I walk about like a barrel of beer at Christmas, under hourly expectation of being tapped.
                                         [Crosses to L.—Tomlinson follows. Both. Adieu, captain, au revoir —and now for the Red Cave.
                                         [Exeunt, L. Paul. Yes, and I will join you again, but only to quit you: one more offence against the laws, to equip me for a foreign army, and I quit the country of my birth and my crimes for ever.
                                         [Exit, R. SCENE VI. —A briliantly illuminated Garden. Lucy, 'Squire Brandon , and Lord Mauleverer , discovered —Persons in all kinds of dress walking and dancing— Bands of Music playing, and every thing to give the idea of a grand fancy dress féte—a dance, during which Paul enters hurriedly, and places a paper in Lucy's hand—after the dance, they all exeunt except Lucy. Lucy. [Going to a purple lamp, which hangs over the entrance to a walk, and reads.] “I implore—I entreat you, Miss Brandon, to see me, if but for a moment. After this night, my presence,
[Page 53]
my presumption will degrade you no more. Will you grant this? I know not—I dare not think, but under any case your name shall be the last on my lips.—P. C.” What shall I do? The impropriety, the singularity of the request, and the incoherent vehemence of the note—the risk, the opprobrium he has incurred solely to see me, all induce me to consent.
Enter Paul Clifford , R. S. E.—Lucy tremblingly advances towards him. Paul. How generous, how condescending is this goodness in Miss Brandon!—I did not dare to expect it; and now—now that I meet you—
                                         [With strong emotion. Lucy. [A pause.] If you have really aught to say to me, [Rather coldly.] speak it quickly.
Paul. [Mastering his embarrassment, and speaking in a clear and firm voice.] Is it true that I have been spoken of in your presence in terms of insult and affront?
Lucy. Yes—no—I scarcely remember.
Paul. Enough—I see, then, it is true, and that the only being in the world to whose good opinion I am not indifferent, has been witness of the insulting manner in which others have dared to speak of me.
Lucy. Why not, then, declare who and what you are?
Paul. In truth, madam, I care not one drop of this worthless blood what men say of me; that time has [25]   passed for ever. I came hither, Miss Brandon, not wasting a thought on these sickening fooleries, or on the hoary idler by whom they are given. I came hither only once more to see you, to hear you speak—to watch you move—to tell you, if any reason for the disclosure offered itself, that I have had the boldness—the crime, to love—to love—oh, God, to adore you! and then leave you for ever. [Lucy is almost fainting.] Dare I touch this hand? [Kneeling, and taking her hand timidly and reverently.] You know not, you cannot dream how unworthy is he who thus presumes—God bless you, Miss Brandon, and if, hereafter, you hear me subjected to still blacker suspicion —if the suspicion become certainty, and the severer scrutiny end in condemnation, believe, at least, that circumstances have carried me beyond my nature; and that under fairer auspices I might have been other than I am. [Rising.] Farewell!
                                         [He presses her hand ardently to his lips, drops it, and is about to exit, when he is intercepted by Lord Mauleverer, who
[Page 54]
enters, L. S. E., with the whole party—'Squire Brandon goes to Lucy, who, but for his support, would fall. Lord M. [With a bow of tranquil insult.] Pardon me, sir, but is it at my invitation or that of any of my servants that you have honoured me with your company on this occasion?
Paul. [Bowing with respect.] Your lordship has only to deign a glance at my dress, to see that I have not intruded myself on your grounds, with the intention of claiming your hospitality. I leave this neighbourhood [50]   to-morrow. A person whom I was very anxious to see before I left was one of your lordship's guests; I heard this, and knew that I should have no other opportunity of meeting them; and I must throw myself on the well-known politeness of Lord Mauleverer, to pardon a freedom originating in a business very much approaching to necessity.
Lord M. [Seeing Paul about to go, bows again more civilly.] If I am not very impertinent, will you allow me to inquire the name of my guest with whom you required a meeting?
Paul. My Lord, [Drawing himself up, and speaking sternly, though still with deference.] your question implies a doubt, and, consequently, an affront; and the tone of it is not such as to justify that concession on my part which the farther explanation you require would imply.
Lord M. [Smiling contemptuously.] Sir, I honour the skill testified by your reply; it must be the result of a profound experience in these affairs, and the next time you favour me with a visit, I am quite sure your motives for indulging me will be no less creditable to you than at present.
                                         [Lord Mauleverer turns to the Ladies. Paul. [Walking deliberately up to Lord M.] My lord, I shall leave it to the judgment of your guests to decide whether you have acted the part of a nobleman or a gentleman, in thus, in your own domains, insulting one who [75]   has given you such explanation of his trespass as would fully excuse him in the eyes of all considerate and courteous persons. I shall also leave it to them to decide, whether the tone of your inquiry allowed me to give you any further apology. But I shall take it upon myself, my lord, to demand from you an immediate explanation of your last speech.
Lord M. [In a rage.] Insolent! Do you bandy words with me!—Begone, or I shall order my servants to thrust you forth.

[Page 55]
Several voices. Begone, sir! Begone!
                                         [Paul stands his ground, gazing around with an angry and defying look of contempt, and half raising his whip, effectually keeps the murmurers from proceeding to violence. Paul. [Disdainfully turning to Lord M.] Poor pretender to breeding or to sense! with one touch of this whip I could shame you for ever, and the action would be but a mild return to your language. But I love rather to teach you, than to correct. According to my creed, my lord, he conquers most in good breeding, who forbears the most; scorn enables me to forbear. Adieu.
                                         [Paul turns on his heel, and strides away.—A murmur, approaching to a groan, follows him as he disappears.—As he exits, Lucy faints in her father's arms, and is borne off. Lord M. Do not let this trifle interrupt the sports— proceed. Bring the remainder of your fireworks here, as the darkness of these walks is better calculated for their display. [A grand display of fireworks, dancing, &c.


END OF ACT II.
ACT III. SCENE I. —The Interior of the Red Cave, with a door, L. S. E.—the lower part of the walls covered with matting —roughly-constructed seats placed round a wood-fire, L. 3d E., without a chimney—a thin volume of smoke ascending to the roof—a table rudely constructed, C.—at one corner, L. U. E., a covered cart against the wall— some coarse carpenter's tools, a blunderbuss, a rifle, and two broadswords, L.—an open cupboard, containing rows of pewter platter, mugs, &c., in the corner, R. U. E.—a large platform of rocks, about eight feet from the ground, occupying 2d and 3d E. R., turned into a dormitory, containing, also, stalls for horses, which are seen in the distance —a cart-harness, and some wagoners' old frocks are fixed on pegs—a door strongly barred, and only just large enough to admit the body of a man, R. S. E., on the platform —the ascent to the platform is by a pair of heavy wooden steps, which fuce L. S. E.— Music . M'Grawler discovered bending over a large gridiron, cooking steaks.
[Page 56]
Enter Paul Clifford, Augustus Tomlinson , and Long Ned , in their highwaymen's dresses, at the door, L. S. E., with their booty, and partly disguised, pulling off their masks, &c. Ned. Heavens! what a jolly life this is!—Some fellows like hunting—damn it! what hunting is like the road?—Only think of our robbing Lord Mauleverer twice, and on the same road, too!
Tom. Lucky for us that we are so strict in robbing in masks: he would not have thought the better of Bath company, if he had seen our faces.
Paul. [Melancholy.] As it was, the poor devil was very nearly despatched; Long Ned was making short work with him, if I had not interposed.
Ned. And why did you?
Paul. Because I will have no killing;—it is the curse of the noble art of our profession to have passionate professors like thee.
Ned. Passionate!—Well, I am a little choleric, I own, but that is not so great a fault on the road as it would be in housebreaking.—I don't know anything that requires so much coolness and self-possession as cleaning out a house from top to bottom—quietly and civilly, mind you.—But come, let us look out for some prog and grog. [Slapping M'Grawler on the back.] Come, old boy, fork up the beefsteaks!
M'Gr. [Rubbing his back.] May the de'il catch ye!
Ned. The de'il!—Mac De'il, you mean.—Sure, the [25]   gentleman must have been a Scotchman! [They all sit at table in C., and eat their supper.] Come, let us look to our winnings. [They empty their pockets.] Here's a magnificent creature! [Taking up a superb watch.] A repeater, by Jove!
Tom I hope not: repeaters would not tell well for your conversation, Ned!—But, powers that be! look at this ring—a diamond of the first water!
Ned. Oh, the sparkler!—it makes one's mouth water as much as itself!—'Sdeath! here's a precious box for a sneezer!—A picture inside, and rubies outside!—The old fellow had an excellent taste.
Tom. Talking of jewellery, I had almost forgotten the Morocco case. [Opening it.] Ye gods! diamonds enough to fret Heaven with little stars on a dark night!
Ned. (C.) Beautiful! magnificent!—But here—here's
[Page 57]
the purse—50 guineas!—And what's this?—Notes, by Jupiter!—We must change these to-morrow before they are stopped.—Three hundred pounds!—Captain, what say you to our luck?
Paul. [Assuming a cheerful tone.] I am delighted!
Tom. (L.) And now for the work of division.—We are the best arithmeticians in the world—addition, subtraction, division, reduction.—We have them all as pat as the Tutor's Assistant, and, what is better, we make them [50]   all apply to the rule of three.
Paul. (R. C.) [Seeing the disappointed and eager face of M'Grawler, takes ten guineas from his share, and pushes them to him.] There!
M'Gr. (R.) Nay, nay, I don't want the money—it is my way to scorn such dross. [Aside—pocketing them.] They'll be the last you'll ever give.
Ned. Come, Mac, you carve this ham—you have had practice in cutting up.
                                         [M'Grawler is about to sit down, when Tomlinson slily subtracts the chair, and he falls. Tom. No jests at M'Grawler; whatever be his faults as a critic, you see that he is well-grounded, and he gets at once to the bottom of a subject. Mac, suppose your next work be entitled, “A Tail of Woe!”
Ned. I am confoundedly sleepy, and we rise early to-morrow.—Gentlemen, your healths.—I am going to bed.
Tom. The captain and I will consult on the business of to-morrow, and follow your example in the twinkling of a bed-post, as it has been shrewdly expressed.
Ned. Good night!
                                         [Goes up the steps, and is seen to lay down on some straw— M'Grawler, yawning, lets down a press bedstead in the lower apartment, L. U. E. M'Gr. [Laying down.] Gude night to you, gude folks! and may you enjoy an uninterrupted sleep in the bosom of Morpheus!
Tom. Oh, good night, my Vicar of Bray! [To Paul, as if not wishing to be heard by the other parties.] So, then, now that you have realized sufficient funds for your purpose, [75]   you will really desert us.—Have you well weighed the pro's and con.'s?—Remember, that nothing is so dangerous to our state as reform: the moment a man grows honest, the gang forsakes him; the magistrate misses his fee; the informer peaches; and the recusant hangs.

[Page 58]
Paul. I have well weighed all this, and have decided on my course.—With my share of our present and late booty, I shall betake myself to the continent—Prussia gives easy trust and ready promotion to all who will enlist in her service.—But, surely, you will join me?
Tom. Why, look ye, my dear Lovett, I have lived as a rogue till I have no other nature than roguery;—I doubt if I should not be a coward were I to turn soldier. I am sure I should be the most consummate of rascals were I to affect to be honest.—No!—I must e'en jog on with my old comrades, and in my old ways, till I jog into the noose hempen, or—melancholy alternative!— the noose matrimonial. Yet, Lovett, though I have as little heart as most men, I feel for you more than I could have thought it possible. I would fain join you—there is devilish good tobacco in Germany, I believe; and, after all, there is not so much difference between the life of a thief and of a soldier.
Paul. In the path you now tread, the gallows and the hulks are the only goals.
Tom. [100]   The prospects are not pleasing, I allow; nor is it desirable to be preserved for another century in the immortality of a glass-case in Surgeons' Hall, grinning from ear to ear, as if one had made the merriest finale imaginable.—Well, well, you shall have my answer tomorrow; but poor Ned!
Paul. Would he not join us?
Tom. Certainly not: his neck is made for a rope, and his mind for the Old Bailey.—There is no hope for him; yet he is an excellent fellow.
Paul. Then now to bed.—I look on your companionship as settled.
Tom. Humph!
                                         [Ascends the steps, and lays down on the platform. Paul. What avails my struggle for a better name?— She will never know it.—Whatever my future lot, she can never share it! My punishment is fixed—it is worse than death—it is life without hope! Every moment I feel, and I shall feel to the last, the pressure of a chain that may never be broken or loosened!—And yet, fool that I am! I cannot leave this country without seeing her again—without telling her that I have really looked my last!
[Music.—He ascends the steps, and lays down in the upper cave —after a little time, M`Grawler slowly elevates himself in
[Page 59]
his bed, and listens—gets up, blows out the light, and silently unbars the door, L. S. E., first removing all the arms, and placing them under his bed, during which Ned yawns, and M`Grawler rolls under his bed—after a pause, he creeps out. M`Gr. Now for the reward!
                                         [Exit on tiptoe at the door, L. S. E. Tom. [Half asleep.] Hist, Lovett!—Methought I heard something in the outer cave.
Paul. [125]   It is the Scot, I suppose. You saw, of course, to the door?
Tom. To be sure.
                                         [They both fall asleep again. Music—Re-enter M`Grawler at the door, L. S. E., looking round, and then beckoning on Nab'em and six Officers. Nab. Is all right?
M`Gr. Yes, as I'm an honest man.
Nab. If we secure them, you shall have the whole reward offered by Judge Brandon for the apprehension of this Lovett, whom he has some idea is the Clifford who made such a stir in Bath.
M`Gr. Then I'll go to the rest of your party. Be firm, for they are downright devils.
                                         [Exit at the door, L. S. E. Ned. [Waking.] Hollo! it must be almost daybreak; and, if we want to cash our notes, and to move the old lord's jewels, we should already be on the start.
Tom. A plague on you! it was but this instant that I was dreaming you were hanged, and now you wake me in the pleasantest part of the dream.
Ned. That's what you call wit, I suppose. [Feeling his way down the steps into the outer cave.] What, ho! Mac! stir those bobbins of thine, which thou art pleased to call legs, and strike a light, and be damned to you.
Tom. A light for you would indeed be a light to lighten the Gentiles.
Ned. Why, Mac, Mac! why don't you answer? 'Faith, I think the Scot's dead. Why, Mac! [Feeling the bed.] [150]   Eh! not here?
Tom. This looks like treachery. [Going down to the outer cave.
Paul. [Rushing down the steps.] Treachery!
Nab. Seize your men!—Yield, sirs!
[Nab'em and another turn their dark lanterns on Paul Clifford and Ned, whom the other Officers seize.
[Page 60]
Tom. [Running to R.] Ah! the swords!—Gone—damnation!
                                         [Springs up the steps on the platform, calling, “Lovett! Lovett! Lovett!” Paul seizes one of the officers by the throat, throws him down, wrenches the pistol from the other, and runs up the steps.—Nab'em fires—then another Officer fires at him as he ascends; but he reaches the side of Tomlinson in safety. Paul. [To Tomlinson] Open the secret door, I will draw up the steps alone!
                                         [Tomlinson goes to unbar the door, and Paul pulls up the steps slowly, as if it required great strength.—Ned meanwhile is struggling with the Officers, who endeavour to detain him by main strength. Nab. Look well to the door, and hang out more light.
                                         [Two or three lanterns are brought in, which dimly light up the cavern—Nab'em and two others see the steps ascending, throw themselves forward, drag them to the ground, and ascend —Paul Clifford, grasping the broken shaft of a cart that lies in his reach, receives the foremost invader with a salute that sends him prostrate and senseless back among his companions. —The second shares the same fate, and Nab'em, who has kept himself in the rear, pauses, with one foot on the steps, dismayed, Clifford raising the weapon in a menacing attitade —Nab'em presents his pistol at Paul. Nab. You, sir! Captain Lovett, alias Howard, alias Jackson, alias Cavendish, alias Solomons, alias Devil; you lay down your club there, and let me come alongside of you, and you'll find me as gentle as a lamb.
Paul. But if I will not let “you come alongside of me,” what then?
Nab. Why, I must send one of these here pops through your skull, that's all. Come down, or let me mount; otherwise I won't be responsible for the consequences.
Paul. [Aside—looking round.] Ha! the door opens. Well, then, give way one moment, that I may plant the steps firmer for you.
                                         [Nab'em gets off the steps—Paul throws them down amongst the Officers, and springs towards the secret door that Tomlinson has just opened, when in rush M`Grawler and four Officers—Tomlinson is knocked down with a bludgeon. M`Gr. [Pointing to Paul.] That's Lovett?
[Paul dodges from the aim of one officer, catches the blow aimed by another in his open hand, wrests the bludgeon from him,
[Page 61]
strikes him to the ground, leaps over Tomlinson's body, knocks down M`Grawler, and exclaiming, Villain! makes his escape, first throwing M`Grawler over the rock into the lower cave. Nab. [Who has recovered from the effects of being knocked down by the steps.] Have you secured Lovett?
Offi. No, he has escaped.
                                         [The scene closes amidst the bustle and confusion. SCENE II. —An Apartment in Brandon's House. Enter Brandon , R., meeting Barlow , L. Bar. The man called Dummie Dunnaker, the rag-merchant, is below, sir.
Bra. Bring him here instantly. [Exit Barlow, L.] This man, when I assured him of his safety, and rewarded him, has confessed to me his share in the robbery of my house some twenty years since, in conjunction with two other men, and that woman, [Placing his hands over his eyes, as if the recollection was painful.] when—the fiend grasp her soul—she stole from me my only hope—the object that first pointed me ambition's path—my only child. This man says he thinks he knows the house where the infant was consigned. If so, and—
Enter Dummie Dunnaker , L. Bra. Well, your news?
Dum. [Twirling his hat.] Vy, your onor, I thinks as ow I shall be able to satisfy your vorship anon. [Approaching the judge with an important air, and whispering.] 'Tis ow as I thought.
Bra. [Vehemently.] Merciful powers! and he is alive? and where?
Dum. I believe as how that he be's alive; but as to saying where he be at this nick of the moment, smash me if I can.
Bra. Is he in this country? or—or do you believe that he has gone abroad?
Dum. [25]   Vy, much of one, and not a little of the other.
Bra. How, speak plain, man. What do you mean?
Dum. Vy I means, your onor, that I can't say where he is.
Bra. And this—this is your boasted news, is it? Dog, damned dog! if you trifle with me, or play me false, I will hang you—by heaven, I will!

[Page 62]
Dum. [Shrinks back, and speaks in a cunning and humble tone.] And vat good vill that do your onor? If so be as ow you scrags I, vill that put your vorship in the vay of finding he?
Bra. [After a moody pause.] True, true; I did not mean to frighten you! never mind what I said; but you can scarcely guess whereabouts he is, or what means of life he pursues. Perhaps—perhaps he may have been driven into dishonesty, in order to maintain himself.
Dum. Such a thing is not unpossible.
Bra. Here, take this purse; renew your search, spare neither expense nor trouble—find him, and I will make you rich for life.
Dum. Vell, your vorship may depend on it, that if he bea'nt already gone to the devil, I'll certainly, sooner or later, place him before your eye once again.
                                         [Going. Bra. You are sure you know nothing of any other clue by which he may be discovered and identified?
Dum. No, sir, I knows nothing—oh, ah! Yes, there's [50]   one leetle matter.
Bra. What? what?
Dum. A packet of letters of her'n and your'n, and some of her hair, as was cut off the night she died—that I—no—I means that—
Bra. Where are they? Where are they?
Dum. Vy here, your onor.
Bra. Fly, make further search, and name your reward —fly!
Dum. I an't got no vings, my lord—I bean't a cherry bum yet, but my trotters shall vag faster than they doed for this many a day—I vish your onor's vorship good day. [Aside.] I am in a jolly good thing here howsomedever.
                                         [Exit, L. Bra. These are the letters she wrote to me in the days of our courtship. [Laughing scornfully.] She carried them away with her, and kept them, it seems, to her dying day. I do not see what else I can do! since it appears that the boy had not even a name when he set out alone from his wretched abode. I fear that an advertisement would have but little chance of even designating, much less finding him. Besides, it may make him a prey to impostors, and, in all probability, he has either left the country, or adopted some mode of living which would prevent his daring to disclose himself.

[Page 63]
Enter Lucy Brandon , R. Luc. Dear uncle, now Lord Mauleverer is gone, I beg [75]   of you to insist on his ending these scenes of folly he has this day annoyed me with—for I will never marry where I cannot love.
Bra. Trust me, Lucy—never think love, that maiden's dream, so valuable as rank and power. Love puts you at the feet of another, and that other a tyrant: rank puts others at your feet, and all those thus subjected are your slaves [Lucy turns away her head.] Would you think, Lucy, that I was once fool enough to imagine that love was a blessing, and to be eagerly sought for? I gave up my hopes, my chances of wealth, of distinction—all that had burned from the years of boyhood into my very heart. I chose poverty, obscurity, humiliation; but I chose also love. What was my reward, Lucy Brandon? I was deceived—deceived. [Lucy takes his hand affectionately.] Yes, I was deceived! But I in turn had a revenge, and a fitting revenge; but it was not the revenge of hatred, but of contempt.
                                         [Laughing sardonically. Lucy. What mean you, sir?
Bra. Lucy, listen: a man, under the assumed name of Welford, adored and married the daughter of a tradesman —I beg pardon, a retired tradesman—and, forsaking all his prospects in life, went to a remote town, and as a country solicitor hoped to pass his days in humble domestic happiness. Poverty, and its grim comrades, [100]   made way for a whole host of peevish complaints; for Mrs. Welford, though a woman of ardent affections and keen sensibilities, was of a light and frivolous turn, and, above all, susceptible to personal vanity. Two years rolled on amidst strife and bickering, which the birth of a lovely child did not dispel, when a gay, handsome nobleman, in riding through the town, was thrown from his horse, and fractured his leg. Welford flew to his assistance, and they recognised in each other the companion of their youth in many a scene of vice and folly. Welford received him in his house—tended him with every care till he had nearly recovered—when one day, going noiselessly into the room, he beheld this friend attempting to seize the hand of the wife, which she coyly withdrew, and she listening to his protestations of love with a pleased and approving smile. The wife started,—but with a bland and smooth expression, the
[Page 64]
host joined the pair, smiled on the nurse, and congratulated the patient on his progress towards recovery. When night came, and he, with a torn heart, retired to rest, his eye fell on the sleeping and cherub countenance of his infant. Kissing it, he murmured, “When I look at you, I will believe that she once loved me—but she would be my disgrace; instead of my disgrace, I will make her the footstool to honour and wealth—and then [125]   to the devil with the footstool! Yes; two years have I borne what was enough to turn my whole blood into gall! inactivity—hopelessness—a wasted heart and life in myself, and contumely from the world; coldness, bickering, ingratitude from one for whom—Oh, ass that I was! I gave up the most cherished part of my nature! Two years I have borne this, and now will have my revenge: I will sell her—sell her, like the commonest beast of a market.”
Lucy. Sell her!
Bra. He fomented this, “my lord's” passion, till “my lord” thought that the passion was worth any price; and, to free himself in this peer of the world's mind, from the degrading remembrance of being a willing cuckold, he, as the marriage had been stolen and private, and the witnesses unknown to the wife, and the proofs easily secured in his possession, made the lordly fool believe it a forged marriage, an ingenious gallantry of his, and washed out the stain with the water of another word— he made a market of a mistress, not a wife. Once, when he looked upon her fair and girlish face, hushed and hallowed by slumber, a certain irresolution and weakness might have been visible in his care-worn features; but, as if for ever to destroy the return of hope or virtue to either, her lips moved and uttered the name of Welford's [150]   courtly guest. About three weeks from that evening, Mrs. Welford eloped with the young nobleman, and on the following morning the distracted husband, with his child, disappeared for ever from the place. Lucy, that Welford, that husband, with the sum for which he bartered his wife, advanced himself in his legal profession—rapidly rose to eminence—was esteemed a pattern of honesty and honour—knighted by his sovereign —and presides as judge over the criminals of his country: Lucy, that man now stands before you.
Lucy. Gracious heavens! what, then, became of the child?

[Page 65]
Bra. One night, about two years after this, returning home buried in thought, I was suddenly aroused from my reverie by a light touch laid on my arm—I turned, and saw one of those unhappy persons who haunt the midnight streets of cities, standing right before my path —the gaze of each fell upon the other—it was thus for the first time since they laid their heads upon the same pillow, that the wretched husband met the wife, and, with a startled and ghastly consciousness, recognised each other. She staggered, and clung to the post for support—the hour my spirit had yearned for, and hope fulfilled. With a bitter curse, I told her, her child should never name her but to blush; and that to him, [175]   and to his children, the name of her I had basely sold to ruin, to hell, should be left as a legacy of odium and of shame. I left her. Three nights from that, my house was broken into: I was awakened by a noise—I started, and found myself in the grasp of two men—and the face of my wife, haggard with searing passions, and ghastly with leprous whiteness of disease and approaching death, glared full upon me. “It is now my turn,” said she; “you have cursed me, and I return the curse: your child shall never know you to his dying day. You shall pine for your son, and find him not; if you find him you shall curse the hour in which he was born.” In the morning, when released from the strong cords which bound me, I went in silence to the child's chamber, and the child was gone.
Lucy. And did you never hear tidings of him?
Bra. I have learned that he is alive, but all chance of finding him, I fear, is hopeless, or, if I do find him, his mother's last words to me will be verified. Do not scorn me, Lucy, though I deserve your scorn. In telling you my story, I but wished to point out to you this: love is a mere bauble, and no human being ever exchanged for it one solid advantage, without repentance; look at my union—a marriage of love—and believe this, if ever rank puts itself under those pretty feet, be sure not to spurn [200]   the footstool.
                                         [Exeunt, R. SCENE III. A Landscape—a hedge, R., and gate, L. Old Bags discovered, on the look-out. Enter Paul , over the gate, L. U. E. Bags. Aha, captain! you are beyond your time, but all's well.

[Page 66]
Paul. All's well; what, are the prisoners released?
Bags. The poor fellows have been up before the queer cuffin, who thinks of sending them to the county gaol this werry day.
Paul. Are the pistols loaded, and the cart ready behind the hedge there, to dash off across the country to the smugglers' vessel?
Bags. Yes, captain.
Paul. They must pass this way?
Bags. Of course.
Paul. Give me my farmer's dress. [Old Bags pulls it out of his bag.] Where's Attie and Scarlet Jem?
Fighting Attie and Scarlet Jem pop up from behind the hedge. Attie & Jem. Here!
Paul. Lie close, and don't move till you hear my whistle—then use all despatch. Are the files ready, to file off their irons?
Bags. They be in the bottom of the cart; and some straw, to cover over the poor fellows as soon as they be in it.
Paul. Away, then, and look out. [Exit Old Bags, at the gate, L. U. E.] Yes, I was the cause of their apprehension —it was I who was sought—it is but fair that I should [25]   strike a blow for their escape, before I attempt my own.
Re-enter Old Bags . Bags. They're coming, captain.
Paul. [Paul whistles—Attie and Jem, armed with bludgeons, jump out of the hedge.] Now, lads, be steady and determined. [They rush out.] Force the horses into the ditch, and so upset the chaise. [A crash is heard—Paul rushes out, L., and returns again with Nab'em, whom he swings to the ground, and gives in charge to Old Bags—the two other Officers are brought on, L., by Attie and Scarlet Jem, and forced to the ground—during this, Paul has again gone out, and brings in Ned and Tomlinson, heavily ironed, and assists them across to R. U. E.] Through the hedge, where a cart awaits you, and you are safe.
                                         [They exeunt through the hedge. Bags. Here comes a gentleman's carriage.
Paul. Away, then—speed away!
                                         [Old Bags makes his escape through the hedge—Fighting Attie and Scarlet Jem are about to do the same, when the Officers,
[Page 67]
who jump on their feet, intercept them—Paul, throwing himself into the contest, engages the Policeman, and gives Attie and Scarlet Jem an opportunity to escape. Policeman. Ah! they have escaped.
                                         [Paul fells one Policeman—the other, in retreating, stumbles and falls—Paul immediately ascends the gate. Paul. [Calling out.] Soho, Robin!
                                         [Nab'em fires at him—Paul places his hand to his side—his head falls to the gate—he endeavours to get over—raises his head, and then, with a faint groan, staggers to the ground— seizes one Officer by the throat—the other Officer collars him, and Nab'em presents a pistol to his head—Paul sinks on his knees—and the scene closes. SCENE IV. Interior of the Mug, as before—table and two chairs brought on, R. Enter Dummie Dunnaker , R., with a newspaper, drinking tea out of a blue mug. Dum. Martha, there is poor piggy Lob so bad, she's calling out for some tape.
Enter Martha , crosses from L. to R. with a bottle and glass. Martha. There's a halteration—the soul of the oman is gone, the spirit has ewaporated from the human bottle: if so be as how little Paul vas avith her, it would be a gallows comfort to her in her latter end—I tried to get out of her if she knowed vere he vas, but it vas no go.
                                         [Seats himself, C., and begins reading the newspaper. Enter Long Ned , L., dressed in a smock-frock, a red belcher neck-kerchief, and a slouched hat, and Augustus Tomlinson , disguised as a clergyman. Ned. (R.) Here we'll take our parting glass. [They drink.] I dare not to go down to the boat with you.
Tom. (L.) Adieu, my friend! since you will remain in England. Really, I have been so hunted from corner to corner, so plagued with polite invitations, similar to those given by a farmer's wife to her ducks, “Dilly, dilly, dilly, come and be killed,” that I no longer recoil from the thoughts of self-banishment.
Ned. And now I will hasten to dive for shelter till the storm blows over. I think of hiring an apartment under ground, and taking my meals at poor Lovett's quarters here. The police will never dream of looking in these vulgar haunts for a man of my fashion.

[Page 68]
Enter Boatman, L. Boa. The boat's all ready, and the Calais packet will sail directly, sir.
                                         [Exit, L. Tom. [Goes to the window and throws it open.] Let me look once more on the spires, and domes, and chimneys of the [25]   great city, whose inhabitants I may never plunder more. [He looks for some time, till the tears start in his eyes.] Farewell! my beloved London, farewell! Where shall I find a city like thee? You have been my father, my brother, and my mistress, and my tailor, and my shoemaker, and my hatter, and my cook, and my wine-merchant. You gave riches to my neighbours, but oh! generous London, you gave those neighbours to me. Heaven only knows, my dear darling London, what I lose in thee! Oh, public charities! Oh, public institutions! Oh, banks that belie mathematical axioms, and make lots out of nothing! Oh, modern improvements, that never answer! Oh, speculations! Oh, companies! Oh, churches! in which no one profits but the parson, and the old women that let pews of an evening! Oh, superb theatres! too small for parks, too enormous for houses, which exclude comedy and comfort, and have a monopoly for performing nonsense gigantically! Oh, houses of plaster, built in a day! Oh, palaces four yards high, with a dome in the middle meant to be invisible! Oh, shops, worth thousands, and shopkeepers not worth a shilling! Oh, London! in a word, receive my last adieu; but for thy damnable tricks of transportation and hanging, I would never leave you! Adieu!
                                         [Tomlinson averts his head, and then, hastily shaking the hand of Long Ned, with a tremulous and warm grasp, hurries off, L.—Ned remains motionless for some moments, following him with his eyes—he then drinks off a tumbler of spirits, lights a candle, draws a small German pipe and a tobacco-box from his pouch, places them on a table, R., and, throwing himself into one chair, and his legs into another, enjoys the result of his pains in a moody and supercilious silence. Dum. [Looking earnestly at him—aside.] Surely I know [50]   that ere phisog.
Ned. Can't you have the manners to be communicative?
Dum. Blow me tight— [Turning round on his chair.] You're velcome. [Reads.] “ The trial of the notorious Lovett commences this day—no less than seven indictments are said to await the prisoner. It has been agreed that the robbery of Lord
[Page 69]
Mauleverer should be the first to come on. The principal witness in this case, is understood to be the king's evidence, M`Grawler. The prisoner will be most fortunate in a judge—never did any one holding the same high office as Sir Willian Brandon, earn an equal reputation for austere morals and sound knowledge .” So, M`Grawler peaches, blows the gaff on his pals, eh! Vell, now, I alvays suspected that ere son of a gun: says I, “Blow me, if he doesn't come to be scragged,” says I, “it vill only be because he'll turn a rusty, and scrag von of his pals.” So you sees— [Turning round and whispering.] —so you sees, Meester Pepper, I vas no fool there.
Ned. [Dropping his pipe and saying, sourly and with a suspicious frown.] What, you know me?
Dum. To be sure and sartin, I does. [Walking to the table where Ned sits.] Does not you know I?
Ned. Ah! Mr. Bummie, or Dummie, I think, eh? Shake a paw, I am glad to see you.
Dum. I say, Meester Pepper, can you tell if so be you as met in your travels our leetle Paul?
Ned. Why, you fool, don't you know— [Checking himself.] But what makes you so anxious to know where he [75]   is?
Dum. Vy, happening premiskously to be at Bow Street von day, and happening to drop summut of the matter to the father, vhen he was riding the high horse with me, he questioned, threatened, and rewarded me, till at last I gave him a leetle inkling of the concarn—you knows vhat I means—the toby concarn as ve vere concarned in vhen leetle Paul vas stole.—But I've been unable any vhere to find Paul, or any trace of him; and the reward offered is so great, that if you'll only tell me vhere I can put my finger on him, you shall have a clear third.
Ned. Why, then, know, Dummie, that Paul is in gaol, and that he is one and the same person as Captain Lovett.
Dum. [With astonishment and pride visible on his features.] The great Captain Lovett. [Faltering] Leetle Paul at the top of his profession! Lord, lord, I alvays said as how he'd the hambition to rise.
Ned. Well, well, but the father?
Dum. The father! Oh, horrible! is the judge that's about to try him for his life, and, perhaps, condemn his own son to the gallows.
Ned. Fly, Dummie, fly, and I will come forward, on a guarantee of safety, to prove his identity.
Dum. Vell, I'll do von good action for vonce in my
[Page 70]
life, if I never does von more, and save leetle Paul though it cost me my life.
                                         [Exeunt, L. SCENE V. —The Court—Jury-Box, C.—Dock, &c., as in a modern Court of Law. Sir William Brandon on the bench, R. S. E.— Paul in the dock, facing him, L. S. E.—the Jury impanelled at the back, the populace behind and at the sides—the Counsel occupying the middle, between the bench and the dock.—Music—Air, “The Judges arraigned.” Counsel. This is our case, my lord.
Bra. Now, prisoner, you are called on for your defence.
Paul. I hesitate not to tell you, my lord judge—to proclaim to you, gentlemen of the jury, that the laws which I have broken through my life I despise in death. My lord, it was the turn of a straw which made me what I am: twelve months ago I was sent to the House of Correction, for an offence which I did not commit, was sentenced to herd with hardened offenders and graduates in vice, and vice's methods of support. The laws themselves caused me to break the laws! first, by implanting within me the goading sense of injustice—secondly, by submitting me to the corruption of example. But for this first aggression on me, I might have been what the world terms honest—I might have progressed to old age and a peaceful grave, through the harmless cheateries of a trade, or the honoured falsehoods of a profession—nay, I might have supported the laws which I have now braved: like the counsel opposed to me, I might have grown sleek on the vices of others, and advanced to honour by my ingenuity in hanging my fellow creatures. One thing only I will add: I put it to you if you have heard that I have committed one sanguinary action, or one ruinous and deliberate fraud? You have heard that I have lived by [25]   the plunder of the rich—I do not deny the charge. From the grinding of the poor, the habitual over-reaching, or the systematic pilsering of my neighbours, my conscience is as free as it is from the charge of cruelty and bloodshed. My lord, I have done! To you whom the law deems the prisoner's counsel—to you, gentlemen of the jury, to whom it has delegated his fate, I leave the chances of my life.
Bra. Gentlemen, [After glancing over his notes.] the evidence you have heard this day, is so clear of the prisoner's
[Page 71]
guilt, that I am certain it would but be a waste of time and words to go through it again. All on which you have to decide is, whether the prisoner be or be not guilty of the robbery of which he is accused: if you doubt the evidence, whether of one witness or of all, the prisoner must receive from you the benefit of that doubt; if not, you are sworn by a solemn oath, which compels you to watch narrowly that you be not influenced by the infirmities, natural to us all, but criminal in you—to lean towards the side of mercy. I dismiss you to the grave consideration of the important case you have heard.
                                         [The Jury retire—a noise is heard, and Dummie Dunnaker is seen endeavouring to force his way, L. into the court—a Constable approaches to keep him back. Dum. I vill give this to my lord, the judge, blow me if I von't.
                                         [Holding up a soiled bit of paper. Bra. [To one of the Officers.] Bring me that paper instantly.
Dum. [Who is a little intoxicated, gives it with ludicrous triumph and self-importance.] Stand away, man! [To a Constable, who has laid hand on his collar.] [50]   You'll see vhat the judge says to that ere bit of paper, and so vill the prisoner, poor fellow!
Bra. [Having read the paper.] What does this mean?
Dum. Vy, I makes bold to beg of you, my lord judge, to do all you can for the prisoner at the bar, as he is no other than the leetle Paul, I spoke to your vorship about —you know vot I mean.
Bra. [His head drops suddenly as if from a spasm, but instantly recovering himself.] See that that madman be immediately removed from the court, and lock him up alone. He is so deranged as to be dangerous.
                                         [Three Constables drag Dummie away. Dum. Eh, sirs! what's this?—I tells you I have saved the Judge's hown flesh and blood. Vy, now, gently there, you'll smart for this, my fine fellow!—Never you mind, Paul, my arty,—I'se done you a true good.
Bra Silence!
                                         [Dummie is awed by this command, and is removed, L.—Paul, during this, has never lifted his eyes, nor appeared aroused from his reverie in any manner—the Judge fixes his gaze on Paul, and, as Dummie is borne out, the Jury return to their box. For. My lord, we find the prisoner guilty, but strongly recommend him to mercy.

[Page 72]
Clerk of the peace. Prisoner, have you anything to urge why sentence of death should not be passed on you?
Paul. [Slowly rises, directs first towards the Jury a brief keen glance, and his eyes then rest full and with a stern significance on the face of the Judge.] My lord, I have but one reason to advance against the sentence of the law— look at me well, my lord, and you may trace in the countenance of the hardened felon you are about to adjudge to death, the features of a youth whom you accused [75]   before a London magistrate of the theft of your watch. On the oath of a man who has one step on the threshold of death, the accusation was unjust—and, fit minister of the laws you represent! you, who will now pass my doom—you were the cause of my crimes! My lord, I have done—I am ready to add another to the long and dark list of victims who are first polluted and then sacrificed, by the blindness and the injustice of human codes.
Bra. [Continuing his gaze upon Paul, slowly passes over his brow the black cap—he essays twice to speak, but cannot—the third time he proceeds.] Prisoner at the bar, it has become my duty to announce to you the close of your mortal career. You have been accused of a daring robbery, and, after an impartial trial, a jury of your countrymen, and the laws of your country, have decided against you. The recommendation to mercy. [He gasps convulsively for breath.] so humanely added by the jury, shall be forwarded to the supreme power, but I cannot flatter you with much hope of success. For the charge you have made against me, whether true or false, and for the anguish it has given me, may you find pardon at another tribunal. It remains for me only, under a reserve too slight, as I have said, to afford you a fair promise of hope, only to—to— [All eyes are turned upon him, and he exerts himself to a last effort to proceed.] to pronounce on you the sharp sentence of the law. It is, that you be taken back to the prison whence you came, and thence (when [100]   the supreme authority shall appoint), to the place of execution, to be there hanged by the neck till you are dead; and heaven have mercy upon you.
                                         [Paul bows and retires, and Brandon, placing his hands over his eyes, sinks to his seat, exhausted—Scene closes.
[Page 73]
SCENE VI. —An Outer Room to the Court—table and two chairs brought on. Enter Brandon , R. Bra. I have, then, beheld before me my long-lost, my anxiously demanded son! that son I have adjudged to the gibbet and the hangman. The torments of the damned are blissful compared to the horrors of aggravation of the pang that lacerated my heart, when I heard him accuse me, his father, as the cause of his present doom, and felt myself at once the murderer and the judge of my own son. [Starts.] Oh, a quick and darting pain runs shivering through my whole frame, and now it fixes on my heart with a gripe like the talons of a bird. Is my hour coming, or have I yet the ordinary term of mortal nature to expect?—Death—I have been so intent on the living objects of the world, that the thought of the ultimate goal of all things startles me with a ghastly awe: nay, nay, these are but passing twitches, chills of the blood that begins to wax thin—I must not die yet— the House of Brandon restored, my power high in the upward gaze of men, my fame set on a lasting basis,— these are yet to come, these I will not die till I have enjoyed. Let me haste to forward a letter to the official quarter, strongly aiding the recommendation of the jury, and urge the substitution for death of transportation for life. [Writes.] My son, my lost son, I would I might see thee once again—but I cannot—I dare not—I feel I dare [25]   not. Barlow!
Enter Barlow , L. Bra. Forward this letter with all speed, and send the man Dunnaker to me.
Bar. He looks as if struck for death. [Aloud.] Are you ill, sir?
Bra. [Looking at him.] Do as I bid you. [Exit Barlow, L.] I must silence the tongue of this scoundrel, Dunnaker, or I am lost for ever. To acknowledge my poor boy now is beyond all possibility, and my name and honours must die with myself—no matter—no matter!
Enter Barlow , L. Bar. The man Dunnaker has escaped, sir.

[Page 74]
Bra. Escaped!
Bar. Yes, sir; he contrived to slip from the hold of the officers, and the crowd being so great, they were unable to retake him.
Bra. Let the officers be instantly ordered into custody; they shall rue this neglect of duty. [Exit Barlow.] Escaped! escaped, perhaps, to couple my name with that of a convicted felon. Oh pride of my house, art thou levelled with the dust? the world to behold its last scion, covered with the darkest ignominy of the law— sooner would I sever my heart-strings than live to see that hour.
Lucy. [Without.] I tell you I must and will enter.
Enter Lucy Brandon and Dummie Dunnaker , L. Lucy. Oh, uncle, dear uncle, the criminal you have [50]   just doomed to death is your own son!
Bra. Who told you this falsehood?
Lucy. This honest man.
Bra. [Seizing Dummie by the throat.] Liar and impostor! your blood be on your own head!
Dum. Oh, lord! murder!
                                         [Forced into the R. corner. Lucy. Uncle, for heaven's sake!
Enter Barlow , L.—Brandon immediately releases Dummie Dunnaker, and by a powerful effort recovers his composure. Bar. Did you call, sir?
Bra. (C.) [Not heeding Barlow.] Go on, my good man. [To Barlow.] Leave us.
                                         [Exit Barlow, L. Dum. [Aside.] Go on—I vas werry near a going off. [Aloud.] If it arnt scragging, it must be unkimmon like it.
                                         [Feeling his neck. Bra. [With a subdued rage.] Now, rascal, let me know what you have done, and if I may yet conceal the disgrace to my name—speak, or your life shall answer it.
Dum. Vell, I vill, your vorship: vhen you vouldn't hear I in the court, I got avay from the nabman, and trotted off to leetle Paul's cousen here, who vas a vaiting vith sich a sight of nobs for you to come to dinner, and I telled her the whole tale; she telled Lord Mollywerry —Lord Mollywerry telled the Scratchetary of State, and I and Long Ned, who vas vith I ven he vas stolen, were had up afore um; there ve left um, and this young ooman, vishing to see you vithout stoppage, I
[Page 75]
showed her the vay, and I'se sure you'll reward I for [75]   my pains.
Bra. With the gallows, scoundrel!—Harkye, if you do not instantly unsay the atrocious lie you have urged, before you're another week older, I'll have you hanged, villain!
Lucy. (L.) Uncle, the truth of their assertions is fully proved by some letters and the certificate of your marriage.
Bra. How! [To Dummie.] Villain, have you deceived me, then?—Did you not say the packet you gave me was all?
Dum. All, as I knowed on; but the others dropped out, and I found um arterwards.
Bra. My good name is then for ever lost! I shall be henceforth a mark for scorn to point her finger at. I, whose strongest principle of mind has been the desire to rebuild the fallen fortunes of my house; I, who have coveted worldly honours, and hoped to regain my son, to perpetuate my name, even to exultant certainty—so the hope's accomplished—how, how, how?
                                         [Falls into a chair, with his hand leaning on the table. Lucy. For the love of mercy, uncle, do not give way to this violent burst of passion! let me entreat—implore of you to save and own your son, who has erred from circumstances, and not from principle.
Bra. [Rising, and stretching his hands upwards.] Never! [100]   never! never! so help me heaven! [After a pause.] What sound was that? the clank of chains—and see, they convey him to the scaffold—how nobly he bears himself —he is my son even in death—the giddy rabble jeer and point at him as my son. What an awful silence now ensues—ah! one moment, and he is no more— hold, hold your hand—he is my son—my son—my son—
                                         [Rushes towards L.—Mauleverer enters at the moment with Paul. Mau. Is free! [Brandon stands transfixed with his eyes on Paul.] On being convinced of the facts of this extraordinary case, I laid it before the King, and he has granted him a pardon, on condition that he sojourns abroad for a time till the notoriety of the affair has somewhat cooled; and by thus, with your sanction, uniting the hands of your son and niece, let me endeavour to atone for the degradation and misery my youthful vices have caused you.

                                         [At this last word Brandon opens his eyes widely with an intent gaze at Paul—his breast heaves violently two or three times, and he falls dead into the arms of Barlow—Lucy screams— Paul kneels, and Dummie Dunnaker and Lord Mauleverer forming two sides of the tableau, the curtain falls.—Music— Air, “That I might be Hanged.” DISPOSITION OF THE CHARACTERS AT THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN Dummie.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. —The Inside of a Country Inn near Bath; different bells ringing; general bustle. Enter Paul Prig , L. Prig. Quite a day of rejoicing this;—all the bells are a ringing! What with fat citizens, dandy doctors, strolling players, young ladies who run away from their papas, and young gentlemen who run away from their creditors,—all who prefer hot water at Bath to hot water at home;—I, Paul Prig, lead a pretty bustling life of it. [Bell rings.] There goes the bell in the parlour again. [Voice without.] And there goes Mrs. P.'s clapper in the bar! [A voice without cries: “Who waits here?] You do, my fine fellow, by your bellowing. Coming, coming.
AIR.— Prig .

Who'd lead an innkeeper's life?
   Who'd be a horse in a mill?
Who'd ever marry a wife,
   That loves to be quiet and still?

Wedlock has comical rigs!
   Clappers I've heard, aye, and many ones!—
But pretty Penelope Prig's
   Is louder and shriller than any one's.                                          [Exit, L. Enter Jeremy, R. Jer. Smoking work! Sixteen miles an hour upon the long trot. Chaise knocked over, horses knocked up. Confound this love, say I: it may be pretty sport for a gentleman;
[Page 12]
but for us servants, 'tis the very devil! Whenever I leave the captain, I'll get into some steady married family, where love is entirely out of the question. Why, [25]   host! landlord! waiter! Prig!
Enter Prig, L. Prig. Coming, your honour, coming.
Jer. Is this the Boar's Head?
Prig. No, sir; there's been a sad revolution in affairs: that head is taken off; and my wife Penelope is the only bore in the house.
Jer. A bad sign, Mr. Prig.
Prig. Damn'd bad! I found one sign would'nt do, so I determined to have twelve.
Jer. The deuce you did!
Prig. Yes; the Zodiac, at your service, sir.
Jer. I should have taken you for the landlord of the Bull and Mouth, by your chattering. Can't you stand still a moment?
Prig. Nothing stands still here, but the clock. I hope you are not in a hurry to set off.
Jer. No; but I'm in a hurry to set to.
Prig. Then you'll find “the feast of reason and the flow of soul!”
Jer. Sole! I don't much care for fish. Give me something substantial.
Prig. Food for body and mind;—a library and a larder. Bacon in both! Hervey's Meditations and Harvey's Fish-sauce. [Bell rings.] Gad so! That's the giantess in the first floor.
Jer. [50]   The giantess!
Prig. Puts up here, on her way to Bath. Seven feet two; carries herself extremely high: proud as a peeress!
Jer. So it appears!
Prig. We've a dwarf, not bigger than a quart decanter! Great attraction! A fire-eater, a queer spark; a travelling showman, who prefers my punch to his own, any day in the week; an alderman, an elephant, a dancing master, and a dancing bear; a merry Andrew, a sad dog! a quaker, a quack doctor, a party of strolling players, a member of parliament of no party at all! An undertaker from Bury-Street, a pastry-cook from Pie Corner, a waddling stock-jobber from Duck-Lane, and a pastoral poet from Hungerford-Market!
Jer. Ha! ha! ha! A motley collection! But, Mr. Prig,
[Page 13]
don't you perceive something very peculiar in my appearance?
Prig. [Aside.] Going to pose me in Lavater; but I'm up. Why, to be sure, there's something devilish keen about you.
Jer. You never guessed better in your life. 'Tis my appetite!
Prig. Glad to hear it. What will you say to some partridges?
Jer. Why grace, to be sure! I thought I smelt something good.
Prig. Should'nt wonder; been endeavouring to keep [75]   'em sweet for this month past. [Bell rings.] Coming! 'Tis well that hunger is the best sauce; for, egad, he'll get no other to his partridges!
                                         [Exit, L. Jer. A notable adventure! My master, Captain Wing'em, meets Miss Maria Testy at a ball in London, falls desperately in love with her, and takes a wild-goose trip to Bath; where she at present resides with her father, Sir Timothy. If Cupid travels at this rate, the Lord keep me from being one of his out-riders!
Enter Captain Wing'em, R. Capt. Here we are, within the last stage of Bath. Come, Jeremy, be stirring;—consider the impatience of love.
Jer. And of hunger, too! If your honour can live upon air, I can't; for it's apt to raise the wind in my stomach.
Capt. Glutton! What the deuce have you to complain of?
Jer. A multitude of things! Since you have been in love, you are no more like the man you were than a squib is like a cannon. I too have had my declensions. Am I not grown as lean as a halbert in your service, a downright transparency? Hav'nt we followed the lady about like her shadow, till we have become nearly shadows ourselves? What hope have we of better fortune at Bath than in London; when, as if to cut off every chance of success, Sir Timothy has added another Argus to his household, in the person of Mrs. Dorothy Dunstable, whom he has placed [100]   over his daughter, as a scarecrow, to frighten away the birds from forbidden fruit!
Capt. Love is blind, Jeremy. Suppose you throw dust in her eyes, by paying court to this venerable Maid of Honor—
Jer. Or rather, from her remaining so long single, this
[Page 14]
venerable lady in waiting! Why, sir, you surely forget my old sweetheart Flora, Miss Maria's waiting maid.
Capt. A lucky thought! You have already a footing in the house.
Jer. Footing indeed! I was well nigh kicked out of it: —but the game's up. We've had a tiff. Madam took it into her head to be jealous, and gave me a box on the ear.
Capt. That was one way of offering you her hand! We must think of some new scheme; so, order the horses, that we may instantly proceed on our journey.
Jer. The horses! the partridges first, if you please, captain. Ah! sir, I wish you would think no more of the lady; she is a sad interruption to our regular meals.
                                         [Exit, R. Capt. Think no more of her! Impossible!
AIR.— Captain Wing'em .

By those cheeks of rosy hue,
By those eyes of heavenly blue,
Coral lips with kisses press'd,
And that gently heaving breast,
By Cupid's bow, and Venus' dove,
[125]   While I live, I'll live to love!

Hear my vows address'd to thee,
God of Love, propitious be!
Let me play a borrow'd part,—
Beauty must be won by Art!
Bolts and bars their charge resign,
Touch'd by that magic wand of thine.                                          [Exit, R. Enter Billy Bombast , through a door at the back of the Scene. Bomb.
                                         The dinner's almost dress'd;
And as my nostrils sniff the savory steam,
Its fragrance whets my appetite!                                          [Comes forward. Here's a catastrophe! After an absence of six long months, to meet my old companions of the sock and buskin in this village. “My soul's in arms, and eager for the fray!” My master, Sir Marmaduke Metaphor, expects me to join him at Bath. Prudence says, “follow him;” but what says Inclination? “To stroll, to starve!” Down, busy devil, down.—Now for my red-nos'd innkeeper. Hah!

[Page 15]

Is that a bell-rope which I see before me;
The handle tow'rds my hand? Come, let me pull thee.                                          [Rings the bell violently. Enter Prig, L. Prig. Hollo! gently over the stones. Coming, coming. Gadzooks, how the bells keep going!
Bomb.
Go, bid thy mistress, when the dinner's ready,
She strike upon the bell. Prig. I tell you what, Mr. Bombast, if my wife catches you at that sort of fun, she'll strike with a vengeance; [150]   she's a mortal antipathy to gentlemen of your cloth.
Bomb. What makes the players so much out of her books, Mr. Prig?
Prig. Out of her books! They are too much in 'em!
Bomb. Trust me, good host.
Prig. Trust you! How can you expect to be trusted, when you say at the bottom of your play-bills, No money to be returned .
Bomb.
Saddle my horses, call my train together.
Degen'rate landlord, I'll not trouble thee! Prig. What, your waggon-train, I suppose! and your horses, ha! ha! ha! Why, the devil a saddle have they got to their backs! It's my opinion, Mr. Bombast, that you want to saddle me.
Enter Mrs. Prig, R. Mrs. P. And so, Mr. Prig, you stand prating here, and leave me to wait upon the customers: there's Sir Matthew and Lady Marrowfat, and all the young masters and misses Marrowfats, just arrived from Saint Mary Axe.
Bomb. The Marrowfats from St. Mary Axe! Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
Mrs. P. And very good fare too. Fowl, indeed! You'll get no fowl here, I promise you.
Prig. Penelope, my dear, that's not classical.
Mrs. P. Farcical, Mr. Prig.
Prig. Be pretty behaved; mind your P's and Q's, Mrs. [175]   P---
Mrs. P. Here's impertinence! Here's assumption! Are you a man, Mr. Prig? Are you a man?
Bomb.
Aye, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil! But I'll be revenged. I'll quit your house, and go to the Angel that stands opposite.

[Page 16]
Prig. Yon may go to the devil.
Bomb. That also stands opposite. [Pointing to Mrs. Prig.] Yes,

Thither in a bark I'll sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, I'll do!                                          [Exit, R. Mrs. P.
Monster of turpentine!                                          [Exeunt Mr. and Mrs. Prig, R. Enter Jeremy, L. Jer. What an infernal fellow is this prating landlord of the Zodiac! The partridges not yet forth-coming; how provoking!
Enter Captain Wing'em, R. Capt. [Half aside.] The horses are a long time preparing. Well, Jeremy, are they ready?
Jer. Not quite, sir.
Capt. I tell you, we must have them instantly.
Jer. That's impossible! They are but just spitted.
Capt. Spitted! What does the blockhead mean?
Jer. They hav'nt been long at the fire.
Capt. Are you mad? The horses at the fire!
Jer. [200]   No, sir, the partridges! They are hardly warm through.
Capt. Sirrah, you deserve to be run through! Away; and prepare to depart instantly.
                                         [Exit, R. Jer. Now for our intriguing expedition. Let me see: my first step must be a reconciliation with Flora: her easy access to the pantry was so convenient! Then old Corkscrew, the butler, is my particular friend; and Sir Timothy's Madeira is London particular. It was never my plan to make love with an empty stomach.
AIR.— Jeremy . ( Tune .—“Here's to the Maiden.”)

Frolicsome Cupid, a sly little lad,
   Laughs at your lovers so sickly;
Makes me look rosy, when others look sad,
   And gives me an appetite quickly!
      If you're inclin'd,
      To tell her your mind,
Don't speak to the lady before you have din'd.
[Page 17]


Down on my knees to some beautiful fair,—
   Bless me, how charming you look, maid!
While roasting a pheasant, or basting a hare,
   I think I could fancy the cook-maid!
      Love is my plan,
      So I am the man,
But then it must be for a sop in the pan!

O the delight of a delicate haunch!
[225]      Your turkeys and geese, I adore 'em!
Each tun-bellied justice, so proud of his paunch,
   I'll rival, and beat the whole Quorum!
      But I must start
      To the girl of my heart;
I neither with her, nor my dinner, can part!                                          [Exit Jeremy, L. SCENE II. —A Library in Sir Timothy Testy's House. Enter Flora . Flo. Well; to be crossed in love is a sad thing, after all! I had just got into the most interesting part of “Love and Sentiment,” when Sir Timothy called me.— Let me see. [Takes a volume out of her pocket.] Here's the place— [The bell rings.] Madam, Madam, I'm coming!— [Reads.] “It is impossible to express the astonishment of the fair Celestina”— [Bell rings again.] Yes, Madam! “when having, with a trembling hand, opened Sir Charles's letter,”—
Enter Mrs. Dunstable, R. Mrs. D. So!—I may ring and ring again for you:— Hey-day! busy at your morning's devotions!— [Snatches the book away.] “Love and Sentiment!” Upon my word; so you are learning to make fine speeches! You would be a great lady, with your pearls and your tissues! why don't you read some good book, “Religious Courtship,” —and “The Whole Duty of Man?”—
                                         [Throws the book on the floor. Flo. I hate “Religious Courtship;”—“Bridget Bluemantle” for my money!
Mrs. D. “Bridget Bluemantle!” O you profane young creature!
Flo. Pray, Mrs. Dunstable, did you ever read “The
[Page 18]
Way to get Married?” It's a charming thing;—d'ye know, I've almost learnt it by heart.
Mrs. D. And more shame for you; I never learnt the [25]   way to get married.
Flo. Then there's “The Old Maid.”
Mrs. D. [Alarmed.] Where?
Flo. [Running to the library shelves.] Why, on the shelf, to be sure;—and “The Wild Irishman,” too; come, I'll put him in my pocket.
                                         [Takes up the volume. Mrs. D. Put “The Wild Irishman” in her pocket! What will the world come to!—Give me the book;— I'll take “The Wild Irishman” in hand, and make him turn over a new leaf;—there, there, and there.
                                         [Tears out the leaves, and throws them on the ground. Enter Davy Dumpling, L. Davy. Please your ladyship's honour, Doctor Fungus do send his dutiful respects, and hopes as how the cherrybran—
Mrs. D. Davy Dumpling, you're a shocking savage!— The eye-water, you mean.
Davy. Rabbit it! but your ladyship's eye-water do make my mouth water most consumedly!
Mrs. D. Send my compliments to Doctor Fungus; and inform him, that his aromatic decoction has been so efficacious, that I can do very well without my glasses.
Davy. Noa, sure,—he! he! he!
Mrs. D. What does the gaby stand grinning at?
Davy. Why, to think as how your ladyship can do without your glasses!—he! he!
                                         [Making a drinking motion with his hand, and exit, L. Flo. Now, my dear, sweet, pretty Miss Dorothy, I've got a favour to ask.—Do let us go to the play this evening, [50]   to see “The Romp.”
Mrs. D. Do you think I am out of my senses?—Go to the play! Go to your chamber, look in the glass, and you'll see the Romp without going to the play.
Flo. A precious life I lead, from one room to another; like a bird in a cage with two perches only, hopping up and down at your discretion.
Mrs. D. Hold your tongue, minikin. I am bound to watch over you, by my known virtue and prudence.
Flo. And I, by my unknown virtue and prudence, am able to watch over myself. People at your age ought to be prudent.

[Page 19]
Mrs. D. At my age?—
Flo. Yes, for you're old enough to be my mother.
Mrs. D. Your mother, hussy?
Flo. No;—my grand-mother, I mean.
Mrs. D. Malicious creature! you shall repent your impertinence.
DUET.— Flora and Mrs. Dunstable . ( Tune .—“I was the Boy for bewitching 'em.”) Mrs. D.
Minikin! Flo.
                                         Pert, Mrs. Dorothy,
   What are the beauties you prize? Mrs. D.
Minx! you'd be happy to borrow the
   Charms you pretend to despise! Flo.
Nature to you has been thrifty, Ma'am! Mrs. D.
   Hussy, 'tis false, for the men
Say that I'm fair,— Flo.
[75]                                            Fat and fifty, Ma'am. Mrs. D.
   Fifty!— Flo.
                                         No, threescore and ten! Mrs. D.
Minikin! Flo.
                                         Pert Mrs. Dorothy,
   What are the beauties you prize? Mrs. D.
Minx! you'd be happy to borrow the
   Charms you pretend to despise!                                          [Exit Mrs. Dunstable, R. Flo. Ill-natured old frump! As Sir Timothy is continually losing his temper, I think Mrs. Dunstable must have found it— [A noise without.] O here comes the cross old gentleman!
Enter Sir Timothy Testy and Maria, L. Sir T. Fire and fury, madam! Am I to be tormented with coxcombs prying round my house, with winkings, noddings, and whisperings among my servants! and with midnight incantations that might raise the Witch of Endor!
Mar. Servants will whisper, papa.
Flo. And musicians will play, your Worship.
Sir T. Play! and so will I; but it shall be the devil with 'em! I had scarcely set my foot in the place, before the bells were all set a-going, as if there had been a parish dinner, or a general insurrection; and, by way of a finishing stroke, some rascally scribbler announces our arrival
[Page 20]
in the papers: a genteel hint for the whole town to come [100]   and stare us out of countenance.
Flo. That's because we are fashionable people, your worship.
Sir T. Fashionable! fiddlestick! Don't I hate fashion and notoriety, invitations, and congratulations! There's that old torment—Lady Gadabout,—
Mar. Old! Sir.
Sir T. I beg her venerable ladyship's pardon; for, though upon the desperation of fifty-six, she has not yet arrived at her years of discretion!
Mar. What do you think of the Widow Night-shade? She dances and sings well, plays upon the harp, and is a tolerable artist.
Sir T. A very tolerable artist! for she paints to a miracle! Plays upon the harp too;—does'nt she play upon every body?—But, Maria, I expect Sir Marmaduke Metaphor here to-day; see that you give him a proper reception.
Mar. [sullenly.] Very well, sir.
Sir T. It is not very well, madam; it's very ill.—What! I suppose that intriguing spark, Captain Wing'em, keeps running in your head; a rascal whom I have never been able to catch a glimpse of. I should long e're this have laid him by the heels, had he not, upon all occasions, taken to 'em so expeditiously.
Mar. The captain is a gentleman, sir.
Sir T. [125]   Aye, a military gentleman; one who wears all his gold on the outside of his pockets! But Sir Marmaduke is a warm man; and, what is more, he is the man of my choice.
Mar. But not of mine, sir.
Sir T. Pshaw! Does'nt a ready-made shoe often fit as well as a bespoke one?
Mar. Then he's so old-fashion'd!—
Flo. So pedantic!—
Mar. So conceited!—
Flo. So ridiculous!—
Sir T. Zounds! D'ye mean to stun me with his good qualities? At your peril make a fool of him.
                                         [Exit Sir Timothy, L. Flo. He will, no doubt, save us the trouble, by making one of himself.
Mar. You see, Flora, my father continues inexorable. What step should I take to avoid this odious marriage?

[Page 21]
Flo. A good many steps, Miss.—Run away.—Here we are, cooped up, like two distressed damsels in a romance, persecuted by a couple of—not enchanters indeed!—Sir Marmaduke Metaphor and his servant, Billy Bombast.
Mar. Nay, Flora, 'tis past a jest.
Flo. 'Tis enough to provoke one, to see the conceited knight approach you with a compliment in form, mood, and figure. Then that chattering play-actor, Billy Bombast.—“Good [150]   morning, Madam Flora!—permit me to salute your fair hand, Madam Flora!” Indeed, more than once, Madam Flora's fair hand longed to salute him!
Mar. Heigho!—That agreeable rake, Captain Wing'em!
Flo. Lackaday!—That bewitching rogue, Corporal Jeremy! Ah! if the truant were here, I should almost be inclined to forgive him.
AIR.— Flora . ( Tune .—“When the hollow drum.”)

When a happy pair, to cure the spleen,
Take a stolen trip to Gretna Green,
   With a merry sound
   The wheels run round,
And crack goes the whip so cheerily.
   Hymen stands
   To join their hands,
And they drive along so merrily!

See, they approach! the bridegroom and bride—

Their horses lag so wearily?

And laughs in his sleeve so merrily.

SCENE III. —A Street in Bath. Enter Captain Wing'em, R. Capt. Welcome, dear delightful Bath! thou scene of gaiety, fashion, and intrigue!—Now to open the campaign. Hah! who comes this way? 'Tis my whimsical acquaintance, Sir Marmaduke Metaphor, sporting his antiquated figure between two pretty women. Ha! ha! ha! He looks for all the world like the Fool of Fashion bound in old calf! How gracefully he takes his leave too: with a bow that might be reckoned fashionable in Queen Elizabeth's time.
Enter Sir Marmaduke Metaphor, L. Sir M. Charming, delectable creatures!—Soh, Captain Wing'em—satirical puppy! [Aside.]
Capt. [Aside.] Pedantic coxcomb!
Sir M. [Aside.] Must rub off a little of my college rust, or he'll be quizzing me. Fine weather for recruiting, Captain! Delightful season for love, logic, and all that— eh?
Capt. Here's a transformation!—the pedant aping the beau!
Sir M. I suppose, Bob, you're at your old pranks again? You hav'nt come to Bath for nothing—maids, widows, wives—all fair game—poaching, captain, poaching.
Capt. You must know, Sir Marmaduke, that I'm about to take out a license to sport upon the manor of matrimony.
Sir M. Matrimony!—He! he! he!—With whom, may [25]   I make bold to inquire?
Capt. A divine creature! young and beautiful! formed with exquisite symmetry, and rising just above the middle size.
Sir M. Not a huge folio, but something between an octavo and a duodecimo.
Capt. Then, she has sparkling eyes, a fair complexion, dimpled cheeks, bewitching smiles, with such a blush!
Sir M. Egad, she's a charmer! and very much resembles the lady whom I am going to marry.
Capt. What! have you taken a trip to Bath upon a matrimonial expedition, too?
Sir M. Don't start so, Bob. Is it so very surprising that I should take a fancy to a lady?

[Page 23]
Capt. No; but it's very surprising that a lady should take a fancy to you.
Sir M. I suppose I'm not beau enough? because, forsooth, I don't follow the fashions.
Capt. Yes, you do follow 'em; but you're a dev'lish long way behind! And do you really intend to be married in that coat?
Sir M. Undoubtedly. You would'nt have me be married without one!
Capt. And how long may you have been in love?
Sir M. Six weeks, and better! I would'nt be without [50]   love for the world, it makes one so sweetly melancholy. I'm a lucky dog, Captain; I'm a fortunate youth! The preliminaries are settled, and we only want the minister to ratify the treaty.—
Capt. Of peace , I hope. Matrimony, you know, is famous for squalls .
Sir M. But not for civil wars—eh, captain?
Capt. Perhaps, you will favour me with the fair lady's name?
Sir M. Delicacy forbid! Well, it won't be the first conquest that I've effected. There was the rich wine-merchant's daughter, of Portsoken Ward, would occasionally smirk at me! and the dashing shoemaker's widow to boot, now and then levelled her sparklers at my physiognomy! Courtship's a charming thing! and so is matrimony! Sir Steeple and the widow Glib for that!
AIR.— Sir Marmaduke . ( Tune .—“‘Heigho!’ says Rowley.”)

Sir Steeple be courted the queer Widow Glib—
   Heigho! Sir Steeple,—
He knew she was rich, and he wanted to crib
Her cash, so he offer'd to make her his rib,
   With his teazing, pleasing,
   Hoaxing and coaxing:
A comical beau was Sir Steeple.

Her purse it was long, though her person was short—
   Heigho! Sir Steeple—
[75]   And her beauty was none of the ravishing sort,
Yet the eye of his knightship her money-bags caught,—
[Page 24]

   Their mingling, jingling,
   Soon set a tingling
The sensitive heart of Sir Steeple.

Now love, in return, the fair widow enthrals,
   And fondly she ogled Sir Steeple;
They gadded together to concerts and balls,
Like the monument link'd to the dome of St. Paul's!
   With their perking, smirking,
   Winking and blinking,
The fair Mrs. Glib and Sir Steeple.

They trotted to church, for their passion increas'd—
   The parson he whisper'd Sir Steeple—
“Your wife's rather short.”—“You are right, master priest;
But, in choosing two evils, I've chosen the least!”
   With their roley poley,
   Coupled so drolly,
Off march'd Widow Glib and Sir Steeple. [Bombast is heard singing without—“O rare, Manager Strut!”] Sir M. Here comes my amanuensis, Billy Bombast. The fellow was formerly a strolling player. I took him just in time to save his whole wardrobe from the pawn-broker's.
Enter Bombast, L. Bomb. O my prophetic soul! my uncle!
Sir M. You see, he's riding the high horse, as usual.
Bomb. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times.
Sir M. [100]   And a thousand to that, I'll be sworn. Billy Bombast, I say!
Bomb. Cousin of Buckingham, I greet ye!
Sir M. Don't cousin me, Billy, or I shall greet you with a cudgel.
Bomb. Cudgel thy brains!
Sir M. He's crazy. We must have his head shav'd.
Bomb. [Sings.] Four-and-twenty perriwigs all of a row! The truth is, sir, I have just met some old acquaintances, and I'm half mad with joy. There are Peregrine Truncheon, Jack Spangle, and the property-man, with the wardrobe, scenery, and machinery, all arriv'd together in a cart.

[Page 25]
Sir M. My stars! the players in a cart!
Bomb. The manager is in a bitter taking. The sea has lost six of its waves, by the carelessness of a rogue of a chamberlain, who set it on fire; the dragon wants a wing and two claws; the drop-scene is ready to drop to pieces; and the waterfall, having sprung a leak, is likely to produce an overflowing house. They have still a mustard-bowl to make thunder, and the landlord of the Half Moon has promised 'em some aquavitæ for lightning.
Sir M. But the ladies, Billy,—the ladies.
Bomb. Bless their dear souls! they arrived safe; but not without some adventures. Mrs. Aurelia Angelica Truncheon, by the upsetting of the vehicle, dropped into [125]   the mire, while that interesting little personage, Master Alphonso Peregrine Truncheon, the young heir-apparent, partook of the disaster; my old favourite, Betty Ranter, travelling in the basket of the Opposition Fly, and fatigued by her exertions the preceding night, in the characters of Desdemona, Columbine, and Moll Flaggon, soon tumbled into the arms of Somnus, when, dreaming about Othello, she suddenly caught a fat Quaker round the neck, and exclaim'd—“Perdition catch my soul, but I do love thee!”
Sir M. How fortunate! I intend, upon my wedding-night, to have a new tragedy of my own performed, for the entertainment of the company, and these players shall form part of the Dramatis Personæ . You, Billy, as first fiddle, must step forward with an elegant air, a bow, and a smirk —thus:—“Ladies and Gentlemen,—To-morrow evening will be performed a new tragedy: to which will be added the farce of ‘Matrimony.’”
Bomb. Not a musical one!
Capt. The whole to conclude with the “Devil to Pay.”
Bomb. I'll speak the prologue, the posey to the ring, dress'd in a full suit of sables,—for

“Without black velvet breeches—what is man?” Then the advertisements! Last night, Mr. Bombast appeared in the character of Don Miraculo Mustachio, in Sir Marmaduke Metaphor's new tragedy, called “The Amiable [150]   Assassin:”—his awfully-grand-terrific-transcendant-sublime and superlative success, absolutely astonished and electrified the audience.
Capt. Bravo, Mr. Bombast! bravo! But, Sir Marmaduke, how do you begin this new tragedy of yours?
Sir M. I flatter myself the opening is fine!—The king
[Page 26]
sitting in a thoughtful posture, with a dagger and a bowl before him.
Capt. Very solemn! A dagger and a bowl of poison.
Sir M. No, of punch. I think the idea is original.
Capt. O, quite!
Sir M. The characters, terribly deep!
Capt. Make 'em miserable?
Sir M. Yes; I marry 'em!
Capt. I hope, Sir Marmaduke, this piece will be more successful than your last one.
Sir M. Yet, what a tragedy it was! Such distress! The audience must have suffered a great deal; how they groaned!
Bomb. [Who, during the above conversation, has relapsed into reverie.]
The clock strikes one!— Sir M.
Does it? Then I must away;
Cupid calls, and I obey.                                          [Exit, R. Bomb.
Your honour won't forget the play. Capt. Ha, ha, ha! You're a wag, Mr. Bombast; you're a wag.
Bomb. [175]   So was my father, Mr. Boniface Bombast, from whom I received the first rudiments of my education. He was in the auctioneering and pamphleteering line: a very eminent man in his way; and equally celebrated for knocking down an article in a sale room, and knocking up one in a review. My first literary attempt was a flaming advertisement, to puff Doctor Von Drench'em's newly invented original and genuine anti-bilious pill, an infallible cure for all acute disorders. My next was a Satirical Poem; very acute, I can assure you. I then composed the whole art and mystery of Blacking, or Every Man his own Polisher; which turned out all Betty Martin: and, among fifty other things, I was the projector of a patent steam-boat, which unluckily blew up, scalded the passengers, and kept me in hot water for a month afterwards!
Capt. And what made you turn stroller?
Bomb. Taste, sir; taste. Mr. Boniface used to prophecy that theatricals would be my ruin; so he bound me apprentice to one Shark, an attorney, to save me from going to the devil!
Capt. I should have thought it had been the readiest way of sending you there!
Bomb. I was now condemned to study John Doe and Richard Roe, instead of King John and King Richard the Third;—what a task for a person of my aspiring abilities!

[Page 27]

[200]   For I had heard of Shakspeare, and I long'd
To play upon the stage some tragic part;
And Heaven soon granted what my sire deny'd! I became acquainted with Mr. Peregrine Truncheon.
Capt. And what came out of this new acquaintance?
Bomb. I came out, sir.—He flattered my talents and offered me an engagement. Lawyer Shark stormed,—I ranted. “Copy that brief,” said he: “Brief let me be,” said I. So I gave the little attorney leg-bail, and left his six pair of stairs' chambers in the Temple, to become a candidate for theatrical honours in the temple of Thespis! where I made some noise.
Capt. I dare say you did!
Bomb. Had you but seen my debut; when I cleaved the general ear with horrid speech, the audience gave me such a peal!
Capt. Orange peel, I suppose;—but where are your companions?
Bomb. At the Pig and Whistle! I hope, Captain, we shall have the honour of your patronage.
Capt. Most certainly; you must, however, excuse me for the present. Adieu, Mr Bombast, I hope you'll have a good house.
                                         [Exit, R. Bomb. Captain, your servant. Thus far we run before the wind! Egad, it will be necessary to raise it too, for the company are heinously unprovided for.—What a thing [225]   it is to be a man of importance! To stand betwixt murder and merriment, like Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy! I've promised the churchwardens to be funny at the parish dinner,—must'nt miss that for the world; 'tis the epitome of good living, and of good manners!
SONG.—The Parish Dinner.
Your city folk, with pun and joke, may boast their feasts a Guildhall,
Where once a year, with dainty cheer, the epicures are fill'd all;
But I maintain, tho' plenty reign, to feast each hungry sinner,
For fare and fun, you'll ten to one prefer a parish dinner;
Where, cheek by jowl, each jovial soul, with double chin you mark,
From honest Parson Humblebee, to Snufflebags the clerk!
[Page 28]
[Spoken.] “I say, vaitor! hand down that calve's head from the top of the table. Vaitor! don't ye hear? The churchwarden wants a tête-à-tête with the calve's head! Mr. Dismal, permit me to pass you a merry-thought.— Here's a skipjack for the dancing-master, and a bishop's nose for the clerk.—Here, Tom! Dick! Harry! Will nobody run for a plate?”—“My horse shall, if you please! he ran for one at the St. Ledger.” “And carried off the stakes —Eh!”—“Hollow!”—“Then he won't do for me, for I'm devilish sharp set.”—“Ha, ha, ha! a wery good joke, Mr. Quibble; but is that 'are your own?”—“No sir, it's a wig!”—“Good again. Well, it's all fair.”—“Aye, and fowl too, at a Parish Dinner!”

See vermicellies, pies and jellies, partridges and custard,
[250]   Widgeons, pigeons, ham, and lamb, in sweet confusion muster'd!
Churchwarden Pinch, who'll never flinch, what gormandizing work he
Kicks up among the chine and tongue, the turtle-soup and turkey!
Such dainty things, as legs and wings, to epicures are grateful,
Of ev'ry dish, from fowl to fish, the lawyer's had a platefull—
While Simon Sneer, the overseer, plays loyally his part,
And now he swallows turtle-soup, and now an apple-tart! [Spoken.] “I wish, sir, you would'nt spill no more parsley and butter into my coat pocket! It's very ungentlemanly of any gentleman to stick needles into another gentleman's wig!”—“Pardon me, Mr. Pestle, you remember the old song, ‘True as the needle to the Pole.’”—“Come, come, Mr. Bacon, none of your gammon. If you come for to go for to prac- tise any of your practical jokes upon my friend, Mr. Pestle, who is a medical practitioner in full practice, I shall try the rule of three upon your knowledge-box, with a—witness my hand!”—“Pray, Mr. Floor'em, may I propound a question?—Hav'nt you been to school?” —“Does a duck swim?”—“And what might you study?” “Knox's (Knocks's) Essays! Will you have a taste?”— “Silence! Silence!”

[Page 29]

Such jamming, cramming, rhyming, chiming, smoking, joking, jollity—
The lawyer grave chaunts forth a stave, the parson's all frivolity!
Now, clear the forks and draw the corks—huzza! the parish pays for't,
Altho' the poor, we're pretty sure, will fast their forty days for't!
[275]   Cries Tommy Stich—“the vine is sich, so pleasant, soft and mellow,
So, Sammy Screw, I'll drink to you, for you're an honest fellow!”
“Good Billy Bray! your song, or say!”—“Excuse me, Muster Chairman!”
“Vy, Freddy Friz, you're sich a quiz,—you'd make a parson swear, man!” [Spoken.] “I never speechify'd in all my born days, except at our last westry, for the election of a turncock, and then I got quizzed.” “Billy,” said the barber, “whenever you opens your mouth, you're sure to put your foot in it!”—“Gentlemen,” says I, “I hold this here argument to be good.”—“Hold that there tongue of yours!” says another, “and then it will be better!”—“Mr. Squintum, will you favour us with a song?” [lisps] “Sir, I never sings, I only recites select speeches out of Millstone, Shikspur, and Wenus Preserved; there's Mr. Brisket, of Carnaby Market:”—“Come, Mr. B. give us a touch of Hamlet.”—“Villlingly: “My tablets— meat , it is, I set it down!”—“I'm sure Mr. Snuffle has got a singing face; do, Mr. Snuffle, strike up a Wolunteer.”—“My woice is only among the middlings, Mr. Pwesident, but, if so be as how the company is agweeable, I'll make it a pint.”—“It will be more so if you make it a bottle.”—“Order! order! where's the chair?”—“Under the table!”—“What! is Mr. Snip sewed up at last? ha! ha! ha!”

For rig and gig, and fun and pun, to make dull care a grinner,
Of every feast, from west to east, give me a parish dinner!                                          [Exit, L.

ACT II. SCENE I. —A Tavern. Bombast, Truncheon , and Spangle , sitting at a table; bottles and glasses before them. TRIO.
Go search thro' the world, you'll find nothing that's droller;
Of all the gay lives is the life of a stroller!
The fam'd Billy Shakspeare was surely to us kin,
For he was a lad of the Sock and the Buskin!
Then drink to the sons of good humour and whim;
   Care is a mumper,
   So each fill a bumper;
A bumper, my hearties, quite up to the brim! Bomb. Ha! ha! ha! how merrily we live! Jack Spangle, give us a toast.
Spang. I must rosin first. [Drinks and fills again.] Here's the stage that goes without wheels; and may it never want inside passengers!
Bomb. Well said, my old Lad o'the Castle!—But now, gentlemen, we'll to business. Sir Marmaduke Metaphor has appointed me acting manager during the representation of his tragedy to-morrow evening. You, Mr. Truncheon, are to perform the part of a staff-officer.
Trunch. A sort of constable, I suppose.
Bomb. Pshaw! Thou wert not wont to be so dull, good Tyrrel. No; a military officer, a noble grand—one General Hoscophoscorhinoribidi.
Span. And who am I to be?
Bomb. You, Jack, are to personate what the Romans [25]   call a Flamen.
Span. And make a flaming speech; eh! Mr. Bombast?
Bomb. But come, Brother Truncheon, give us a spice of your quality. Speak the speech,—attitudinize. [Truncheon throws himself into a ridiculous posture.] My dear fellow, don't moralize with your hands in your breeches pockets: 'tis a custom more honour'd in the breach than the observance.
Trunch. Will that do?
                                         [Assuming a different attitude. Bomb. Too much in the tea-pot style. Never pour out your soul in that position; nor swing your arms and legs,
[Page 31]
like the sails of a windmill. Suit the action to the word. Very well. Now fire away, General!
Trunch. [repeating.]
Ah! what is man?
A pancake toss'd in Fortune's frying-pan. Bomb. A little more fire to frying-pan.
Trunch.
A pancake toss'd in fortune's frying-pan!                                          [with energy.
A target meant for sport;—his heart the bull's eye. Bomb. There you've hit it!
Trunch.
A patch-work piece. Bomb. [Truncheon pulls out his handkerchief.] Patchwork, indeed!
Trunch.
All pride and linsey woolsey! Bomb. Excellent well! You'll soon be perfect; but hark ye, gentlemen, not a word about the new tragedy. Sir [50]   Marmaduke intends to give his father-in-law, Sir Timothy, an agreeable surprise. Let me see: when shall we three meet again? To-night at six;—and to-morrow we'll e'en to't, like French falconers.
Trunch. Agreed—

Courage, my friends! Come, Billy, boy! come, Jack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back!                                          [Exeunt Truncheon and Spangle, R. Bomb. That's more than I'll undertake to answer for! folks may complain of our loose habits, but if mine are not tight enough, there's no bracing in buttons! What an exquisite fit? Yet Flora says that I'm a gentleman of the last edition, and that I write verses, like my master, for my own amusement, and nobody else's! Ah! she hasn't half the taste of my old flame, Miss Barbara Bluffenwig, the comical spinster of Leighton Buzzard!
AIR.— Bombast . ( Tune —“A master I have.”)

The lass that I courted was formal and shy,
   Harum, scarum, jig:
The lass that I lov'd, as a quaker was sly,
   Harum, scarum, jig:
The lass that I lov'd had a cast in her eye,
I swore she was pretty, but could'nt tell why,
   With my sighing, dying,
   Crocodile crying.
   Ranting, tearing,
   Swaggering, swearing,
[75]      Harum, scarum, jig.
[Page 32]


So sweetly she sung, that she rival'd the lark:
   Harum, scarum, jig:
So sweetly she sung like an owl in the dark:
   Harum, scarum, jig:
So sweetly she sung, that she kindled the spark
Of love in the breast of an old parish-clerk,
   With her quivering, quaking,
   Shivering, shaking,
   Tuning, quavering,
   Swooning, wavering,
   Harum, scarum, jig!

Her form it was slim, and her figure was tight,
   Harum, scarum, jig!
Her pretty turn'd ancle, it ravish'd me quite,
   Harum, scarum, jig!
She'd caper and frisk it from morning till night,
Tho' her left leg was shorter by far than her right;
   With her rumbling, tumbling,
   Galloping, grumbling;
   O such a dancer!
   Gemini, Cancer,
   Harum, scarum, jig!                                          [Exit, L. SCENE II. —An Apartment in Sir Timothy Testy's House. Enter Maria and Captain Wing'em, R. Mar. You surprise me! Mrs. Dunstable a party in our plot!
Capt. Yes, captivated by the martial dress and address of Corporal Jeremy, she has consented to forward our plans, provided the aforesaid Corporal Jeremy, bachelor, do take the said Dorothy Dunstable, spinster, to be his wedded wife.
Mar. His wife! O monstrous!—And does the old woman absolutely intend to run away?
Capt. Run, she cannot; hobble, she will!— but we must be on the alert. A post-chaise will be at the garden gate at dusk this evening, with four of the prettiest bloods—
Mar. And do you really expect me to gallop off with them?

[Page 33]
Capt. Certainly not. You are merely to take your seat in the chaise, and let them gallop off with you.
Mar. And what will the town—the newspapers—say of us?
Capt. The Sun may, probably, cast some reflections; and the Times exclaim “O Tempora, O Mores!” but Bell's Messenger will pardon the Belle's Stratagem; and the Weekly Dispatch will give us credit for ours, depend upon't.
Mar. [25]   We shall make a charming subject for a paragraph!
Capt. Admirable! “Yesterday, eloped with Captain W---, the lovely and all-accomplished Miss Maria T---. The happy couple immediately set off for Scotland, where they intend to pass the honey-moon, the Captain having a romantic castle beautifully situated on the banks of the Ayr.”
Mar. In the air! ha! ha! ha! You military gentlemen are famous for building castles in that quarter.
Enter Flora, L. in haste. Flo. Now, miss, now is the time, to play off our scheme upon Sir Marmaduke. Your father has sent him to try his fortune with you himself: his countenance is of prodigious length, and portends a set speech and a laboured compliment.
Mar. I shall never have courage to perform my part!
Flo. Never fear: I'll prompt you.—Captain, please to step into the next room,—we shall have rare sport! [Capt. Wing'em goes into an adjoining room at the back of the stage, which opens with folding doors.] Here comes our Demosthenes.
Enter Sir Marmaduke Metaphor , cautiously. Maria and Flora retire up the Stage, and continue conversing, pretending not to see him, L. Sir M. Sir Timothy told me not to be too precipitate. Fair and softly, she's a divine creature!
Mar. I think, Flora, I must obey my father, and marry Sir Marmaduke.
Sir M. So: she begins to mollify.
Mar. He's a ridiculous object, to be sure!
Sir M. [50]   That's not quite so civil.
Flo. Therefore, Miss, the fittest person in the world to be made a tool of.

[Page 34]
Sir M. Thank'e, Flora! Egad, the devil wants no abler deputy than a waiting maid.
Mar. [Turning round] As I live, here is the very gentleman himself! Sir Knight, I'm yours.
Sir M. Not yet, thank heaven!
Mar. I suppose you have come to break your mind to me.
Sir M. Break my head, if I do! Any other time, madam, will do as well.
Mar. Where's your gallantry, sir? There is no time like the present.
Sir M. She's vastly importunate!
Mar. Speak: I'm all attention.
Sir M. She's determined to come to the point. To be sure, miss, I might have come with some such intention; but—
Mar. No long speeches, I beg. The matter is soon settled: for my wishes are extremely moderate, though there are certain indispensables; such as pearls, diamonds, new plate once a year, a fine equipage, two sets of horses, my coach, curricle, vis-a-vis, &c. which one cannot do without!
Sir M. A glorious inventory!
Flo. [75]   Then, sir, my lady must have a fine house, and furniture fit for a duchess. If she loses five hundred guineas at play, you must not lose your temper; but, to please her, you must cut down your timber, demolish your old house, banish all your acquaintance, and burn your manuscripts.
Sir M. Burn my manuscripts!
Mar. In a word, you must supply my wants and bear with my ill humours. I will see whom I please, go where I please, spend what I please, and stay abroad when I please!
Flo. You forget, miss, the opera box, with an engagement to Signora Squalini. You must know, Sir Marmaduke, that I've a great penchant for music myself,—the piano , the soprano , the falsetto . I'll hum you a tune.
Sir M. I think they are humming me all the time. Confound her sopranos !
AIR.— Flora.
Sir Knight, when he a wooing came, stood staring like a statue—
[Page 35]

He whin'd, he pin'd, so droll, poor soul! and look'd quite stupid at you.
The maiden sigh'd, the knight he cry'd—to love I will provoke her—
Will you marry me, my dear Alley Croaker? Sir M. Hang Alley Croaker.
Mar. For shame, Sir Marmaduke.
Sir M. I say hang Alley Croaker, and Signora Squalini, very particularly.
Flo. Ha! ha! ha! you're quite in a pleasant humour. [100]   Shall I give you a merry air?
Sir M. You give yourself too many, madam!
Mar. Pray, Sir Marmaduke, did you ever dance?
Sir M. Dance, madam! I never danc'd in all my life;— and, what is more, I never intend to dance.
Mar. You must positively be initiated in the graces. I should abominate a husband that could'nt dance. Shall we waltz, reel, jig, minuet? Come, sir, chuse your figure.
Sir M. I don't know what you mean by figure. Methinks, I cut a very queer one myself!—but if I dance— that is to say—if I dance, ladies, may I be—
Flo. Hush, sir, no vows. A gentleman without his pumps looks as awkward as a lawyer without his wig, or an apothecary without his cane. Dance you must. Head up, hands down, toes out, right foot first— pousset .
Sir M. What's pussy?
Mar. Very well. Now, lead off.
TRIO.— Sir Marmaduke, Flora , and Maria . Mar.
Will you dance to the tune of Sir Simon the King? Sir M.
   Pooh, I can't, ma'am!
   Zounds, I shan't ma'am! Flo.
A waltz, cotillion, or highland fling,
   A minuet, jig, or fandango? Sir M.
Jigs I detest—d'ye think I'm an ape,
To kick up my heels to the fiddle's vile scrape? Mar.
   See, I declare,
[125]      What a grace, what an air! Flo.
A Vestris in skill, an Adonis in shape! Sir M.
Well, if I must, egad, here goes:
   Right foot tapering,
   Left foot capering,
I shall charm all the belles, and astonish the beaux,
   When I dance a jig or fandango!
[Page 36]
Mar., Flo.
Hold up your head, sir, and turn out your toes,
   When you dance a jig or fandango. [During the above trio, which is to the tune of a waltz, Maria and Flora teach Sir Marmaduke to dance; after which they join in a reel with great spirit, Sir Marmaduke dancing until quite exhausted.] Sir M. Mercy, ladies, or I'm a dead man.
Mar. Well done, Sir Marmaduke! you'll be quite a proficient in time; why, you seem surprised at my condescension.
Sir M. Surprised!—I'm rapt,—astonished,—astounded, —I'm absolutely electrified! I hardly know whether I stand on my head or my heels.
Mar. And now I hope we understand each other?
Sir M. O, perfectly.
Mar. The old catalogue of sighs, tears, fond looks, &c. &c. that generally precede the marriage ceremony, like a dull prologue to a play, we may as well dispense with.
Sir M. Suppose, Miss Maria, we dispense with the ceremony altogether.
Mar. Amazement! Am I awake!
Sir M. Yes, miss, and so am I, to your whims and your vagaries, your reels and your fandangos. And you, [150]   Madam Pert, with your opera box and Signora Squalini; why, the revenues of the Grand Seignor, the Great Mogul, or the Cham of Tartary, would hardly be sufficient to support such extravagance!
Flo. I don't know what you may call extravagance, sir.
Sir M. Then I'll tell you, minx! five hundred guineas lost at cards.
Flo. Would you have my lady play at two-penny whist?
Sir M. Aye, and Pope Joan.
Mar. Or beggar my neighbour, perhaps.
Sir M. Beggar your neighbour, if you please, madam, but don't think to beggar me. Adieu, Miss Maria. You wont catch me again at right foot tapering—left foot capering! Good bye, Signora Squalini, with your waltzes and caterwaulings! Damn caterwauling, aye, and pussy into the bargain!
                                         [Exit Sir Marmaduke, L. Flo. Ha! ha! ha! the poor knight is nearly frightened out of his wits; we have fairly got rid of him; now to set our prisoner free. [Taps at the room-door.] Noble Captain, come forth!

[Page 37]
Enter Captain Wing'em from the room. Capt. You play'd your parts admirably; but, my dear Maria, let us instantly take advantage of this happy opportunity. [A loud noise without.]
Mar. Surely that was my father's voice?—He comes this way! What's to be done?
Flo. [175]   Suppose, captain, you try the window:                                          [The voices approach nearer. Cupid will lend you wings!
Capt. I wish he'd lend me an extra pair of legs! I'll run all chances, and step back to my old quarters.
                                         [Capt. Wing'em goes into the room. Enter Sir Timothy , dragging in Jeremy , disguised, L. Sir Tim. As I am a knight and one of the quorum, tell me, fellow, how you came to be skulking in my house?
Jer. Skulking in your house, sir!
Sir Tim. Don't repeat my words, sirrah:—Let me take your dispositions :—Your name, villain!
Jer. Toby Tripeface, your honour.
Sir Tim. Were you born in wedlock, Toby?
Jer. Noa, your worship; at Yackum, in Yorkshire.
Sir Tim. And who are your parents?
Jer. He! he! he! why my feyther and mother, your excellency!
Sir Tim. Humph! and what is your profession?
Jer. I be a conjuror. I tells fortins; and finds things that be lost.
Sir Tim. And things that are not lost, I dare say! You are then a sort of necromancer?
Jer. No: not a negro man, sir.
Sir Tim. And what the plague brings you here?
Jer. Plague, sure enough! Why, love for that young woman, your worship, [pointing to Flora.] We've a sort of sneaking kindness for one another.
Sir Tim. [200]   Sneaking kindness! You've no business to be sneaking in my house, sirrah. Is this true, Mistress Iniquity?
Flo. I blush to own it, Sir Timothy!
Sir Tim. Blush! then it must be something very bad indeed!—however, Toby, to cool the effects of your passion, I'll desire my coachman to give you twenty good stripes!
[Flora and Maria make motions to Captain Wing'em, who, during the above conversation, keeps peeping through the
[Page 38]
door in the flat; he then comes forward; Maria and Flora steal off, R.] Capt. [Tapping Sir Timothy on the shoulder.] Sir Timothy, I claim the right of punishing that man myself, as a deserter from the company which I have the honour to command.
Sir Tim. A deserter! Toby Tripeface! eh! villain!
Jer. Yes, sir, a deserter, and, like your worship, no conjurer! [Throwing open his great coat, under which appear his regimentals.]
Sir Tim. And who are you, my young Mars?—and how the deuce came you into my house?
Capt. I watched the fellow hither, and am come to take him into custody. I'm Lieutenant Hector Thunderbolt, at your service!
Sir Tim. Pray, Lieutenant Hector Thunderbolt, do you know anything of one Captain Wing'em?
Capt. The captain is a particular friend of mine: have you any thing to say against him?
Sir T. Only that the intriguing rascal has more than once attempted to run away with my daughter.
Capt. I've heard Wing'em relate some of his pranks at [225]   your house.—When you were out at the window, he was in at the door; and when you were in at the door, he was out at the window.—There are odds depending, that the captain runs away with your daughter in spite of you.
Sir T. Then he must be quick about it, for she's going to be married to morrow!
Capt. Nay, even more than that, Sir Timothy; that he tricks you in your very presence, and bamboozles you to your face!
Sir T. But what must I be about, to let him! No, no— tell your intriguing friend, that I'm perfectly well prepared for his reception, should he, or his facetious corporal, honor me with another visit: a loaded blunderbuss shall sound his welcome; and for Master Jeremy, his bottleholder, a cat-o'-nine-tails shall do his business.
Jer. [Aside.] You see what we have to expect, sir.
Capt. The captain is a bold man.—Faint heart never won fair lady.—Don't be too positive, Sir Timothy.
Sir T. Zounds! I'll be imperative! for superlative must be his cunning if it gets the better of my sagacity. If he has wit enough to wed my daughter, in the name of ingenuity let him wear her; and if he makes a dupe of me
[Page 39]
at this time o'day, let him call me fool all my life afterwards!
Capt. Ha! ha! ha! I'll deliver your message, Sir Timothy.
Sir T. [250]   And you shall be umpire, Lieutenant, to say whether I've been fairly tricked!
Capt. Agreed! Ha! ha! ha!—Come, sirrah.
                                         [Exeunt Capt. W. and Jeremy, R. Sir T. Make a fool of me to my face! Ha! ha! ha!—I should like to see the jockey that would dare to make a fool of a knight and an alderman!
AIR.— Sir Timothy .

Fee, faw, fum! Orator mum!
   All knotty points I decide well;
Tippling blocks I put in the stocks,
   And rogues I hand over to Bridewell.

Great and small, gentlefolks all,
   Own I'm with dignity big,
They stare, declare, and swear, O rare!
   What wisdom must lie in my wig!

No pleader, no proctor, no lawyer, no doctor,
   In country, court, college, or town:
No peer, or M.P., can look grander than me,
   When I'm drest in my Alderman's gown.

Julap, cathartic, give people the heart-ache,
   Wine it gives spirits and glee;
With turtle and ven'son to feast jolly friends on,
   Old Nick may take physic for me!                                          [Exit, L. SCENE III. —An Apartment. Enter Bombast . Bomb. Glorious doings for the approaching marriage!— all bustle and business. The dinner, which has been a long time in preparation, will be speedily produced; it will, no doubt, go down extremely well,—become a popular entertainment, and, I hope, have a good run.— [Flora crosses the stage, L.] Ha! Flora! whither so fast?
Flo. Mr. Bombast, I'm in a great hurry.
Bomb. What, hey for the wedding! You must know
[Page 40]
I've composed an Epithalamium myself, for the occasion: 'tis so tender, so soft!
Flo. No wonder;—it comes from a soft place. [pointing to his forehead.]
Bomb. Then my Ode to Sleep: “Awake, O Muse!”— and my Sonnet to Winter, beginning with “Hail!”
Flo. A sonnet to winter should always begin with hail!
Bomb. I've been thinking what a charming Lucy you'd make for the Beggar's Opera.
Flo. Very likely; for we should be beggars ourselves!
Bomb. How naturally we should play the Prison Scene together!
Flo. I'm afraid we should; but here comes Mrs. Dunstable; shew her your Odes.—You must, however, bawl pretty loud, before she'll hear a word you say.
                                         [Exit Flora, R. Bomb. Bawl! I'll thunder!
Enter Mrs. Dunstable, L. viewing herself in a pocket-glass. Mrs. D. Methinks, I never look'd more enchanting [25]   than I do at this moment! No wonder Jeremy was so much captivated with my appearance.
Bomb. See how the old lass keeps holding the mirror up to nature, or rather to ill-nature!—Now to astonish her with a stave of my own composing!
Bombast sings the following Air in the highest strain of affectation, using the most extravagant gestures: AIR. ( Tune .—“The Legacy.)

Charming Dorothy! Dorothy Dunstable!
   Tall as Juno, as Venus fair!
Love reigns here, High Bailiff and Constable,
   Major domo; he takes the chair!

Blythe he looks, as ne'er to snarl he meant;
   Say but Aye, and he'll not say No!
Return, as member to Hymen's parliament,
   Me, Love's candidate, bending low!

Charming Dorothy! What can the matter be?
   How you stare! D'ye think I'm a ghost?
Where the deuce can her hearing, odd rat her! be?
   Bless my soul! she's as deaf as a post!
[Page 41]


Pink of excellence! Beauty's paragon!
   Why do those cherry cheeks look so blue?
My heart's ta'en flight! it is like a cock sparrow, gone!
   Hopp'd the twig, love! and flown to you! Mrs. D. What does the capering gentleman mean?—Is he also struck with my figure? [aside.] Where can Jeremy be all this time?
Bomb. O, I'm a key too low! I must speak a little louder. [50]   I'm sorry to find you are so deaf, Mrs. Dunstable. [Speaks loud.]
Mrs. D. Deaf!
Bomb. I wonder you don't carry a trumpet, madam, since the drum of your ear is so much out of repair!
                                         [Raises his voice still higher. Mrs D. I don't understand you!
Bomb. Poor woman, how very deaf she is! Let me aggravate my voice. Mrs. Dorothy Dunstable, I say!
                                         [Bawls very loud in her ear. Mrs. D. Bless my heart, man, d'ye mean to stun me?
Bomb. I understand you are a great lover of the Muses, Mrs. D---; so sit down, if you please.
                                         [Places her in a chair. Mrs. D. Sit down!
Bomb. No standing room!
Mrs. D. I'll raise the house!
Bomb. [sings.]
“Pray Goody, please to moderate the rancour of your tongue!” Mrs. D. Help! help!
Bomb. Nay, madam, if you're determined to alarm the neighbourhood, I'm off. Exit in a hurry, as Swift says.
                                         [Exit Bombast, L. Mrs. D. What a Turk! what a Saracen! to insult one of the softer sex! But where can that sweet youth, Jeremy, be roving? Heigho! Cupid reigns sole monarch of this susceptible bosom!
AIR.— Mrs. Dunstable .
O love! dear deluder!
Thou charming intruder;
   Nigh perching,
   Sly urchin,
[75]         Your arrow have sped,—
[Page 42]

What soft palpitations!
Delightful sensations!
   Pursue me,
   Run thro' me,
   And woo me
   To wed!
Pity the once stable
Dorothy Dunstable!
   Cringing and
   Twinging,
      She bows at your throne!
   Tend her,
   Defend her,
   Gallant her,
   Enchant her,
   Nor taunt her,
   But grant her
      A spark of her own!                                          [Exit R. SCENE IV. —A Hall in Sir Timothy Testy's House. Enter Sir Timothy, L. Sir T. Thieves! Murder! A trick! I'm robbed, bit, bamboozled, and ruined! I'll have every soul in the house hanged! and old mother Dunstable whipped at the cart's tail! the villians could never have carried off my daughter without her connivance.
Enter Davy Dumpling , (cautiously,) R. Davy D. Hush! your worship!—hush!—there's a plot—
Sir T. A plot, blockhead! Don't I know there's a plot? An't I the dupe of the plot? Is'nt the plot blown to my utter shame and confusion? Won't the plot call me fool all the days of my life after?
Davy D. Then you won't be called fool many days! You've not got long to live.—Hush!—You'll be assassinated!
Sir T. What! are you trying it on, too! Am I to be the butt of the whole house?—Have a care, sirrah; have a care—I'm in no humour to be trifled with.
Davy D. It's no trifle, your worship—you'll be murdered.—Hush! and you shall hear all.—As I wur passing by the library just now, I seed Sir Marmaduke and Billy
[Page 43]
Bombast, as it wur, in close confabulation—so thinks I to mysel—
Sir T. What the devil signifies what you thought? Don't keep me upon hot irons!—What did you hear?—What did you see?
Davy D. [25]   Sir Marmaduke talked about dispatching the old gentleman—
Sir T. What old gentleman?
Davy D. Why your worship, to a dead sartainty!— “Let's smother him,” says he—“No, no,” says Billy. “Sharp's the word—I'll stick him!” and he promised to perform it to-morrow night!
Sir T. Lord have mercy upon me!
Davy D. Billy said it would be so natural .
Sir T. Unnatural! the parricides!
Davy D. And that would surprise you a little.
Sir T. It has surprised me a great deal!
Davy D. “It will require some execution ,” said Sir Marmaduke.
Sir T. Execution, indeed! I'm struck all of a heap!— What can be their motive? But no matter—there's not a moment to be lost. Run, Davy, and alarm the servants! Raise the house! Fetch the constable! [Exit Davy, R. Bombast enters (L.) in deep reverie, brandishing a dagger, and talking to himself.] O Lord! here comes one of the villains, ready armed for the business!
                                         [Retires to the back of the scene. Bomb. Parry, carte, tierce! I'll pink the old boy to a miracle!
Sir T. O the parry, carte, villain!
Bomb. Here's a quietus ! [Holding up the dagger.] Hip! That's the time o'day. [Making a plunge.] Lie still, old [50]   Truepenny! [Puts the dagger in his side pocket.]
Sir T. I breathe again!
Bomb. There'll be a scene after the murder! Out, damned spot! Wheu!—Who'd have thought the old man had got so much blood in him?
Sir T. [Rushing forward.] Who would indeed, villain! Had you not raised it by your abominable, wicked plot? Keep off—Stand—In the king's name, I charge you to surrender!
Bomb. Hah! By the Lord, our plot is as good a plot as ever was laid; an excellent plot.
Sir T. Go on; I'm a magistrate—confess, and discharge your conscience.

[Page 44]
Bomb. That's discharged already! I am myself but indifferent honest.
Sir T. I don't doubt it! You must away to prison, sirrah! Here, Ralph! Davy! Where the devil are you all? [Davy and Servants enter with Sir Marmaduke, R.] Secure this villain!
Davy. Here be t'other conspirator, your worship.
Sir M. Upon my word, this is vastly uncivil! What d'ye mean?
Sir T. What do you mean? Parry carte! Pink me to a miracle!
Sir M. I protest—
Sir T. [75]   So do I! Sharp's the word! We'll stick him!
Sir M. But, Sir Timothy—
Sir T. Hip! That's the time o'day! O the cruel, abominable assassins! Hold 'em fast! Off with 'em!
Bomb. Here's a gig!
[The Servants and Sir Timothy carry off Sir Marmaduke and Bombast, L.] Enter Jeremy, R. Jer. Ha! ha! ha! Sir Marmaduke Metaphor and Billy Bombast are fairly taken up and taken in ! O Davy Dumpling, thou prince of dunderheads, how much is my master indebted to thy stupidity!
Enter Flora, L. Flo. What is the meaning of all this, Jeremy?
Jer. Why, Sir Marmaduke's tragedy !—I've no time to explain further; for here comes my intended.
Enter Mrs. Dunstable, R. Mrs. D. [Whispering Jeremy.] Jeremy! I'm ready to start.
Jer. I must get rid of old iniquity, or she'll spoil all. O thou disgrace to ancient ladies! But she raves! See how her eyes glare!
Mrs. D. You vile seducer of unsuspecting innocence! But I see it all! Have I read Religious Courtship? Have I studied the Whole Duty of Man for this?
                                         [Exit, R. Enter Sir Timothy and Sir Marmaduke, L. Sir T. Ha! ha! ha! An odd blunder, indeed! A comical tragedy! You must pardon me for laughing, Sir Marmaduke.
Sir M. All my tragedies have got a knack of making
[Page 45]
people merry, while not a soul will laugh at any of my comedies. I wish, with all my heart, that Davy Dumpling [100]   had been at Davy Jones's Locker.
Sir T. Well, sirrah Toby Tripeface, and what have you to say for breaking into my house, and running away with my daughter?
Jer. I did neither, Sir Timothy. Mrs. Dorothy Dunstable let me into your house; and I let my master out, who ran away with your daughter himself. But here is a couple, who will no doubt make their own apology.
Enter Captain Wing'em and Maria, L. Sir T. Soh, good folks, you've tricked the old knight; you've bamboozled the alderman to his face, and, now, you're come to laugh at him. Hark ye, Captain Wing'em, you shall find me no enemy to a good joke, though I, myself, may chance to be the subject of it;—and Sir Marmaduke's tragedy has put us in such good humour, that, with every disposition to look angry, I can't muster up a face, for the life of me.—I am convinced you are a gentleman, since you bear his majesty's commission. I believe your regard for my daughter is disinterested, for you have hazarded the displeasure of her father, upon whom her fortune depends; and that you are a monstrous clever fellow, is beyond a doubt, or you would'nt have proved too many for me. These recommendations have overcome my scruples; I therefore desire that the wedding-dinner may be celebrated at my house: and if our good friend, Sir Marmaduke, will honour us with his presence—
Sir M. [125]   With all my heart! Since I'm not to be the subject of an Epithalamium, egad, I'll be the author of one! I'll invoke the muse. Descend, ye nine!—
Enter Bombast, R. Bomb.
Blush, blush, thou sun! Start back, thou rapid ocean,
And into chaos pulverise the world!
For Billy Bombast has receiv'd a blow!
And Davy and Sir Timothy shall die! Sir T. Mr. Bombast, I beg ten thousand pardons for this ludicrous mistake.
Bomb. Ha, ha, ha! Poison in jest, Sir Timothy! No offence in the world. But the new tragedy?
Sir T. It shall be performed, Mr. Bombast; you shall pink the old boy to a miracle!

[Page 46]
Bomb. Shall I, Sir Timothy?—Then, ladies and gentlemen, may we request the honour of your company tomorrow evening? [To the audience.]
FINALE. Flo.

Our author lean, behind the scene,
   To you entrusts his cause;
O glad his heart before we part,
   And greet him with applause. Bomb.

And, may he find his laughing plan
   Has pleas'd our gen'rous friends well;
Each critic the Good-natur'd man,
   Why then, “All's well that ends well.” Back matter

THE END.

[Page ]
Front matter 1
The Spectator is requested not to compare, too rigidly, the Incidents presented in this Piece, with the History of Henri Quatre .—A selection of events, without a rigid adherence to chronological order, seemed all that was necessary for a Drama of this unambitious character and pretension. The writer has more anxiously endeavoured to sketch the History of Henri's mind.—His magnanimity, courage, gallantry, good humour, and clemency.


[Page 1]
Main text ACT I. SCENE I.                                          A View of the Road from St. Denis to Paris, with the Avenue of Trees which lines the Road—on the sides of which are the Vineyards—on the right is a View of Mont Martre, with its Windmills and (now demolished) Abbey and Monastery.— In the distance is the old City of Paris, surrounded with Walls, as in the Time of Henri.— On the left, an Hotelerie, on which is written, ‘Gervais, Restaurateur.’ Trio and Chorus.
   On our King's natal day,
   Let us dance, sing and play,
May our blessings his mildness and virtues repay. Pinceau.
This portrait resembles the king, you'll agree;
What dignity!—grace!
[Page 2]
Gervais.
                                         That's because 'tis like me.
I'm confoundedly weary. Louison.
                                         Nay, uncle, sit still. Pinceau.
While I finish the portrait with Titian's skill. ( Gervais yawns.) Louison.
Oh, fie, uncle Gervais, is that like a king?
To yawn while your subjects so loyally sing. Chorus.
On our king's natal day, &c. Lou. Very well indeed, monsieur Pinceau—hold —I've got a silver Henri, (takes out a coin) and I'll compare them. The nose a little sharper, I think. How lucky it is, uncle Gervais, that you should be so like the good Henri.
Pin. He is, indeed, like Henri, for he patronizes genius. More this way—nay, nay, look at me, neighbour Gervais, and don't be eyeing and ogling the girls.
Lou. Aye, there again he's like Henri.
Pin. Now for the finishing touch—'tis done! (rises) and I flatter myself equally honours the monarch [25]   and the Artist. The price of the painting is a crown.
Ger. A crown for the king's head? ha! ha! that's well enough!
Pin. Come, the money.

[Page 3]
Ger. The money! ah, there I'm particularly like Henri, for I have not a dernier left in my purse; but the good cause will prevail, and, then for golden days. So, up with the royal sign, in spite of the league, Mayenne, or the devil. (they place the sign, and shout.) Now, attend!—This being the king's natal day, we celebrate it with a superb fête champêtre —I, of course, represent Henri—little Pinceau, the great Sully—and Louison here, the charming Gabrielle:—but, Louison, where is your husband, Jocrisse?
Lou. Oh! he's practicing the dancers.
Ger. Well, away with you. Mind, boys, your best doublets and hose,—and, girls, your holiday coiffures, and garlands, and lilies. Louison, prepare your dress, à la Gabrielle. Pinceau, be punctual.
                                         [Exeunt Louison, Pinceau, and Peasants. Ger. Oh, oh, travellers —and, by the courier, of some rank—Now then I must descend to household affairs. But, 'tis hard to take off a laurel crown, and put on a nightcap. [50]   (puts on the white cap of a cook.) To convert the sash of a general into a cook's apron. (lets down the sash, which makes an apron.) And degrade the bâton of a mareschal, by using it as a rolling pin, (imitating the act of rolling paste) but, however, I shall soon resume my dignities.
A cracking of whips—enter Germain with large boots, and in the costume of an avant courier. Ger. My host of the (looking at the sign) ah!
[Page 4]
ah! the good cause! (shaking hands) Well, prepare for the reception of general d'Aumont, so long absent from his native country, and who is crossing to his chateau at Meudon. Come, shew him what a French cook can achieve. What have you in the house, eh? (rubbing his hands.)
Ger. A beautiful couple of pigeons, which will make a most delicious partridge patê.
Germ. A couple of pigeons! why zounds, I could eat a flock myself.
Ger. Be pacified! let not your valiant stomach rise in resentment—I'll clap my panniers on my mule, and be back from St. Denis time enough for the general's dinner, (apart) if these cursed leaguers have not eat up everything in the country. Monsieur courier, I salute you.
                                         [Exit. Enter Louison. Lou. Can I offer anything, or shall I call Jocrisse?
Germ. No, no, don't call him—there's no necessity [75]   to trouble him—but, pray who is Jocrisse? (chucking her under the chin.)
Lou. My husband.
Germ. Oh, your husband!
Enter Jocrisse dancing, but seeing the familiarity of Germain, rushes between them. Joc. Yes, monsieur, her husband! Me, Jocrisse,
[Page 5]
nephew to the king's head, and mâitre de dance to this distinguished canton.
Lou. La! Jocrisse, the gentleman only wanted some refreshment!
Joc. Which you were about to administer. This way if you please, Monsieur courier. (Germain bows.) What a wretched bow! poor creature. Stay where you are, madame Jocrisse, and reflect on the solemn duties of a wife. (with authority.)
                                         [Exeunt Germain and Jocrisse. Lou. So, so, jealous already! I'm sure I've given him no cause, though we have been married a week. But, indeed, my dear husband, if you think marriage is to dull the lustre of these eyes, or make others blind to their attractions, you'll find yourself mistaken.
Air.— Louison .
I.
Dear husband, take no jealous flights,
   'Twill make your forehead tingle;
The dames of France know well their rights,
   Or better far live single.
The heart will still go pit-a-pat,
[100]      The eye will seek to lure;
What, banish ogling, and all that!
   Au contraire—Vive l'Amour!
II.
Of spinning-wheels I hate the sound,
   And knitting is so teasing;
[Page 6]

But in the dance's giddy round
   I find the art of pleasing.
My foot is to the tune so pat,
   I cannot sit mum-chance,
What banish ogling, and all that!
   Au contraire—Vive la Dance! Enter Moustache shouldering a trenching spade, and wiping his forehead. Mou. House! within there!—Confound these new-fangled fortifications! in good old times there was no breast work, but an iron cuirass, that covered a valiant heart; then, courage had fair play— no pickaxe and shovel work then, but to dig the soldier's grave; (Louison comes down) but now, what with their ravelins, and curtains, and hornwork —
Lou. Curtains and hornwork! what can he be talking about?
Mou. My rose of May! by the beard of St. Louis, 'tis refreshing to look on you. Ah! a soldier's work would go but heavily, if a bottle and kind landlady did not lighten his labour. Come, a [125]   flask of wine, of the colour of those cherry lips, you ripe, tempting rogue! (taking her hand.)
Enter Jocrisse. Joc. Fury and fiends, another! but hold,—he's a soldier, and, thank heaven, I can always curb my
[Page 7]
daring spirit. (advances) Health and salutation to the brave Moustache! What are your valiant wishes?
Mou. Some wine.
Joc. In a moment—But the thunder of your canon has had a strange effect upon it; for I don't believe there is a drop of Burgundy in the cellar, that is not turned sour.
Mou. That I can credit.
Joc. Louison a flask of wine for this noble veteran—and, (apart) you may draw some vinegar out of the same cask, for the sallad.— (aloud) and, do you hear, cover the table, prepare the napkins, the silver forks, and—
Lou. And—and—and—I must do every thing, lazy fellow! We have been married a week, and I'm sure you've done little or nothing since.
                                         [Exit. Joc. Well, my man of battles, the news—where's the good Henri?
Mou. Advancing by the Marne on Charenton; and if a junction can be made with the brave Crillon, [150]   on the south of the Seine, rebellious Paris must fall.
Joc. When it does, I shall demand an audience of the king—that is, in an amicable way. I suppose I shall know him by the splendour of his clothes.
Mou. Henri makes himself known by the strength of his arm.
Joc. Does he? then, pray introduce me, because
[Page 8]
I do not wish to become acquainted with him in that manner— [aside] . I wonder if he's really like Uncle Gervais! Nobody has suffered more by the war than I have. I had there a tract of country— you may guess its extent, when I tell you, it maintained a goat, and a couple of geese. In one night it was transformed into a battery—bang went the cannon, up jump'd the goat, and off he scampered, and twirz! away flew the geese!
Mou. Ha! ha! ha!
Joc. There's no eating and drinking; and what's of much more vital consequence, there's no dancing, for that bang, bang, [quick] bang, bang, bang! Who can keep time in such horrid discord? I'm sure, the noise of yesterday's battle put my poor dear wife into such a taking, and I trembled—
Mou. You trembled!—
Joc. [175]   For the enemy—I trembled for the enemy.
Mou. What, you fear you may become a widower?
Joc. Of course; very much— [aside] —but I fear much more my poor wife becoming a widow.
Mou. Take comfort;—She shall have a couple of the tallest carbineers in my company, to guard her night and day, ha! ha!
Joc. No, no, let me have six to protect me, and I'll guard my wife myself. [Louison laughs without] There! now she has got with that swaggering Courier. —You shall have your wine directly. Oh! Madame Jocrisse!
                                         [Exit into house.
[Page 9]
Mou. Fighting Henri's battles is but a very midling trade. No pay, and little provender. My Swiss fellows begin to mutiny—they stick to their motto —“no money, no Swiss.”
Enter Eugene de Biron. Eug. Moustache! how is it, my excellent old friend?
Mou. Weary, Eugene, of this grubbing like a mole—this girlish game of bo-peep behind green hillocks.
Eug. If we can join Crillon, by forcing the bridge of Charenton, Paris must fall. Oh! that Henri thought me worthy of the enterprize!
Mou. Still the daring Eugene—
Eug. [200]   Nay, good Moustache. I should disgrace my tutor did I not court danger. When I was the height of my sword, did you not teach me to march, to attack—?
Mou. Aye, that was easy enough, but I never could teach you to retreat—the lesson of prudence.
Eug. Hard blows, which you, my kind friend, could never give, [affectionately tapping his shoulder] will teach me that .
Enter Jocrisse, with wine, looking back into the house. Joc. Your wine, brave Sergeant.
                                         [Moustache drinks and shudders.
[Page 10]
Eug. Is it good, ha! ha! ha!
Mou. Excellent—vinegar!
                                         (Exit Jocrisse. Eug. Heigho! heigho! heigho!
Mou. Ever in extremes—this moment laughing —the next, sighing.
Eug. I have too much cause. You know my adoration of St. Leon's sister; but how can I aspire to her hand? Alas! my sword is all my fortune, for my imprudent father has dissipated my inheritance, and is now immured in a prison.
Mou. Take comfort. I know he is free, and his debts paid.
Eug. Liberated!—his debts discharged!—how! by whom?
Mou. That I do not know.
O'Don. [225]   — (without) —Hollo! Garçon!
                                         [Jocrisse comes from the house and runs off. Eug. 'Tis O'Donnel, our Hibernian ally.
                                         [Goes to meet him. Mou. Well, I must to the trenches again. (finishes his wine, and throws down a piece of money.) Right alegar, by all that's villainous!
                                         [Exit. Enter Jocrisse and O'Donnel, O'Donnel shaking hands with Eugene. O'Don. Take care of my Arabian Jennet. [Exit Jocrisse.] Oh! 'tis the sweetest temper'd fiery litte devil, and loves a bit of a bustle as well as its master.
[Page 11]
A mighty pretty, snug, elegant battle we had yesterday, Eugene. But, when do we fight again? What are the King's plans?
Eug. I rather think, O'Donnel, he is rash enough to form them, without consulting either of us.
O'Don. There is not any thing on the face of nature so fatiguing to an Irishman, as doing nothing at all.
Eug. Ha! ha!
O'Don. Faith, 'tis no disparagement; for a little skirmishing is natural to us. When bits of brats, we get the old broomsticks, and crackle one another's heads about, for pure love and diversion.
Eug. Then, O'Donnel, what think you of Henri's severe edict against duelling?
O'Don. What, of punishing with death those who [250]   are killed in tilting? [Imitating.] Oh! that's mighty wrong; because, 'tis only by fighting that we can have peace and quietness. Belligerents become allies; foes, friends; rivals, brothers and sisters;— in short, I maintain there can be no love, or sociability without it.—But, Eugene, put me in mind, by and bye, to tell you something of St. Leon.—
Eug. Oh. my friend, Frederic! the Cato of the army, and wishes to place the helmet of Minerva on the head of Mars.—ha! ha!
O'Don. With all his wisdom, he has been in a mighty bothering scrape.
Eug. As how? (with anxiety.)

[Page 12]
O'Don. Faith, the story's an awkward one, and surprised every body;—he was arrested about an affair, in which there was gambling, a celebrated courtezan, and a jew—
Eug. Frederic St. Leon! Impossible!
O'Don. Impossible! well, I wont pretend to judge about that, because I only know 'tis true. He was suspended from his command, but he demanded an audience of the King, who restored him.
Eug. The sage, moralizing St. Leon a gamester! the pretender to my sister's hand a libertine!—This must be explained.
O'Don. [275]   Faith, Eugene, these big-tongued saints are no better than we poor blundering sinners. (looking off.) By the hill of Howth, here is St. Leon.
Eug. Leave us together.
O'Don. I say, Eugene, rally the stoic:—let fly a volley of old Seneca's maxims at him:—faith, I think I would bother him myself with some Irish philosophy, only I must look after my little Arabian.
                                         [Exit. Eug. So, so, Frederic! You, who, I own, always nettled me by your dignified correctness, and assumed superiority of conduct,—now, 'tis my turn to be the censurer. Nothing rouses my indignation like canting, vile hypocrisy.

[Page 13]
                                         Enter Frederic St. Leon, drest exactly in the same uniform as Eugene, being Officers of the same Regiment. Fred. Dearest Eugene, welcome me with open arms. See, here are brevets of our promotion— (Produces two Commissions.) Eugene takes one, coldly bows, and places it in the pocket of his mantle, or surtout. Fred. does the same.) What say you to a ride to the chateau of Mendon, to visit our mistresses? I expect to meet there General D'Aumont, a rich, and noble, relation, whom I have not seen from infancy, and, I trust, Eugene, that my present rank, backed by my uncle's approbation, may justify my ambition of becoming the brother of my friend.
Eug. [300]   Ambition, Frederic! You might have spared that taunt on the humbled house of De Biron.
Fred. Nay, Eugene, how you pervert— (smiling.)
Eug. But, humbled as it is, it is still too proud to form an alliance, that is not founded on the honorable basis of mutual confidence.
Fred. He has heard of my supposed disgrace.
Eug. Till I am worthy of that , I am unworthy of being your brother.
Fred. No, not unworthy.— (with kindness.)
Eug. Then, if you will, you are unworthy of becoming mine.

[Page 14]
Fred. What course can I pursue? to avow the truth! explain the seeming mystery? No! my own delicacy, and my sacred promise to his father, forbid it. (aside.) Eugene, it would be affectation to pretend ignorance of the cause of your offended feelings,— yet, by our friendship I swear,—
Eug. 'Tis safe to swear by that which has no existence.
Fred. I can bear much from you, Eugene.
Eug. I perceive you can— Explain your late conduct, or— (with violence)
Fred. Hold! persuasion having failed to produce that explanation—I need not say, how impotent a [325]   threat must be. You will repent this—
Eug. A defiance?
Fred. No, on my honour.
Eug. Pretenders to high honour are generally pretenders only to what should accompany it.
Fred. Those words must be instantly explained, and, to my satisfaction.
Eug. You know then where to ask it. Hush, we are interrupted.
Enter an Aid de Camp. Aid de C. Captain de Biron, I have the honour of delivering this from the king. (gives a paper to Eugene—they all bow.)
                                         [Exit Aid de Camp. Eug. (placing the order he has received, in the
[Page 15]
pocket of his mantle.) His majesty does not select philosophers to fight his battles. (with proud asperity.)
Fred. This insolence should be instantly visited with due chastisement, but you have public duties to fulfil.
Eug. A convenient shelter. (smiling contemptuously.)
Fred. Shelter! (with rage and energy) Vile, false, and ungrateful! You presume on my temper, which shall not protect you—you presume on my friendship, which thus I root from my heart; behold the breast of deadly hate! Strike unfeeling boy, but guard well your own. (they attack each other.)
Enter O'Donnel, who rushes in between them. O'Don. What the devil are you at? Oh, you cruel monsters—to fall a fighting without letting me [350]   know: and then to begin in the public road, where you are sure of being interrupted. Oh, shame on such barbarous doings! Is not there a snug barn, that opens its hospitable doors to receive you? Off with your mantles, and set to work like gentlenen. Pretty kind of friends indeed, to be quarrelling! Go, fight, and make it up directly. (they take off their mantles, which they throw down.)
Eug. Follow me.
                                         [Exeunt Frederic and Eugene. O'Don. How lucky it was I came to keep pace and regularity!

[Page 16]
D'Aumont. (without.) Take care of my horses.
O'Don. Eh, who the devil have we here? A general officer? Was ever anything so unlucky! Oh, at this rate they'll never be friends! Stop there!
(Eugene groans.) O'Don. 'Tis too late, one has fallen.
Fred. Help! assist my unfortunate friend!
Enter Frederic, supporting Eugene, wounded; & Enter from the Hotellerie, Germain, who assists Eugene. Eug. Fly, Frederic, save yourself—your hand— I was to blame. Fly! fly! (faints.)
O'Don. Here, here, take your mantle, and away! (giving him by mistake the cloak of Eugene.)
Fred. Unkind Eugene! what misery have you caused! (rushes out.)
Enter General D'Aumont and Jocrisse. D'Aum. Here we will rest for refreshment. Germain! (calling him from the house.)
Ger. Here, General! (he is supporting Eugene.)
D'Aum. [375]   What do I see! a wounded officer?
Joc. Yes, noble sir.
D'Aum. How came he wounded? this blood— (seeing blood on the hands of Jocrisse.)
Joc. The blood of a pigeon! by my parole of honour, I have not a drop of man's blood about me.

[Page 17]
Germ. A private rencontre, general.
D'Aum. In spite of Henri's severe denunciation? This must be reported—an example must be made. Bring me his papers.
O'Don. Here they are, general. (picking up Frederic's mantle, takes papers from it, and gives them to D'Aumont.)
D'Aum. What! is it possible? Frederic St. Leon, captain of—My nephew!! Zounds!
O'Don. Sure, and I have given Frederic the wrong cloak—Faith, that's just right, and may prevent consequences from following.
D'Aum. Poor Frederic! 'tis my nephew, sir.
O'Don. Indeed!
D Aum. I have not seen him since childhood— and to meet thus! Who was his antagonist?
O'Don. Eugene de Biron. (looking over his shoulder towards Eugene.)
D'Aum. I've heard of the hot-headed coxcomb; but he shall suffer for it.
O'Don. Faith, he does, poor devil! (aside, and looking at Eugene.)
D Aum. You attended them?
O'Don. [400]   O, yes,—I was their friend.
D'Aum. Friend! strange perversion of the noblest word, that unites man to man! I say, come hither— this matter must be hushed up.— (aside.)
O'Don. To be sure it must. (aside.) —Was there ever thing so clever as my giving Frederic the wrong mantle? It will protect us all. Oh! leave an Irishman
[Page 18]
alone for making a mistake without a blunder!
D'Aum. Germain, prepare to convey that wounded officer (Jocrisse and Germain bear out Eugene) to my chateau at Meudon. (To O'Donnel.) —I'll not declare myself at this moment—it would agitate and surprise him, to tell him I am his uncle.
O'Don. Faith, and so it would.— (aside.)
D'Aum. But I'll depart instantly, and break the matter to his sister.
O'Don. That is to say, his sweetheart.— (aside.)
D'Aum. You'll give your attendance?
O'Don. To be sure. Be careful there!— (looking off.)
D'Aum. But not a word.— (Goes up and takes out his purse.)
O'Don. —(Places his hand on his breast, and bows.) —Oh! none but St. Patrick's own good- looking self, would have sent this luck; for it is not every day that Providence showers down guardian angels in the shape of old Generals, ready booted and spurred. Take care there!
                                         [Exit. D'Aum. [425]   Poor Frederic! Oh, if I get that Eugene into my clutch, I'll cool his hot blood for him.— (Jocrisse enters) —There's for the refreshment of my servant.— (gives money.)
Joc. But, General, please to consider the dinner we intended to provide.
D'Aum. Which you intend I shall pay for.— (throwing a purse.) —My horses!— (calling to his attendants.)

[Page 19]
Joc. I beg pardon—but when may we expect his Majesty in these parts?
D'Aum. He may, probably, examine the northern posts in a few days.
Joc. And, pray, now, between ourselves, how do the affairs of government go on?— [with an easy familiarity.]
D'Aum. —My horses.
                                         [Exit. Joc. Rude, but cautious. A savage, but a brave one. I don't think I should find it at all difficult to be a great man.— [imitating General D'Aumont] — My horses!—
Lou. —I hope we shall soon see your honour again.
Joc. There, now she has got with the General.— Oh, madame Jocrisse!—
General [without] —My horses!
                                         [Exit. SCENE II. AN APARTMENT IN GENERAL D'AUMONTS CHATEAU AT MEUDON. Enter Clotilde, preceded by La Fleur (a Page.) Clo. My pretty page, announce to the lovely Florence, the arrival of her friend, Clotilde.
Page. Clotilde de Biron, sister to a certain
[Page 20]
gay cavalier, named Eugene, that loves my lady, and, I know, is beloved.
Clo. O fie! you must not tell tales.
Page. Here comes my fair mistress.
Enter Florence. Flor. My dearest Clotilde, welcome to my heart —I'm so happy to see you; but—but—heigho!
Clo. Eugene—
Flor. I was not thinking of him; yet, 'tis strange he should neglect you so—to be wanting in brotherly affection to so kind a sister as you are!—
Clo. Is almost as bad, as being wanting in gallantry to so sweet a mistress as you are:—But your brother Frederic, seems equally negligent of family observances.
Flor. Oh, you are sure of seeing Frederic, who will be here, to welcome our noble relation, General D'Aumont. I vow, I should not like such a lover as my brother,—so moral, so wise, so good—
Clo. So feeling, and so benevolent —You would probably prefer my brother, the gay, rash, laughing, storming Eugene.
Flor. [25]   A thousand times over.
Clo. My dear Florence,—I, as his sister, am in continual alarm at the impetuosity of his temper;— as a wife, I should be wretched.
Flor. I don't think I should—at any rate I would venture, for the pleasure of being your sister.
Clo. Ha! ha!

[Page 21]
Flor. La Fleur, conduct my friend to her apartment, while I give orders for the general's reception. Adieu!—but, tell me, Clotilde,—what can be the reason, that, to-day, every object seems so uninteresting —the air so unrefreshing—the landscape so triste, and the time so tedious.
Clo. My dear Florence, ask your heart that question.
                                         [Exeunt Clotilde and Page. Flor. Ask my heart the question! I will.
Air.— Florence .
I.
Tell me, my heart, why morning prime,
   Looks like the fading eve;
Why the gay lark's celestial chime
   But tells the soul to grieve;
The heaving bosom seems to say—
Oh, hapless maid! your love's away.
II.
Tell me, my heart, why summer's glow
   A wintry day beguiles!
Why Flora's beauties seem to blow,
[50]      And fading nature smiles!
Some Zephyr whispers in my ear—
   Ah, happy maid! your love is near.                                          [Exit.
[Page 22]
SCENE III. A VIEW OF PARIS.—SAME AS SCENE I. Enter Jocrisse, Louison follows unobserved. Joc. Bless my soul! uncle Gervais not come back, and nothing arranged for the fête! I must plan every thing. Let me see—here's Gervais's throne, and here sits Sully.—Very well—then I'm here—no, no, that's impossible. I can't be here— I'm there—that's clear enough.—Louison's here—
Lou. No, Louison's here.
Joc. Oh my poor brain! a head is but a head— and you know, my dear wife, if every body loads it with something—
Lou. No wonder it shoots and aches a little.
Joc. Ah, Louison, had we been taught reading and writing, what a magnificent couple we should have been! For, though reading and writing are not so essential as dancing, they are occasionally, very useful accomplishments.
Lou. For instance,—to read a tender billet-doux.
Joc. A billet-doux! Oh fie, madam Jocrisse.
Enter a Peasant, peeping in with caution. Pea. Hist! your name?
Joc. Jocrisse.

[Page 23]
Pea. A letter! snug! from Gervais! hush!
                                         [Exit in haste. Joc. A letter—snug from Gervais —hush! 'Tis a letter, certainly. (opens and turns it over, shewing he cannot read writing.) [25]   Would you like to read it?
Lou. No, no, 'tis for you. (they stand opposite each other, both having hold of the letter, turning it about.)
Joc. The contents of this letter, depend upon it, are a great secret.
Lou. Very—and likely to remain one. Enter Pinceau. Oh here's Pinceau!
Joc. My dear friend, such an event! A letter from Gervais. He says,—but I wont tell you what he says—you would not believe me; so read it yourself, and be convinced. (Pinceau puts on his glasses and begins reading it.)
Lou. Yes, that's the best way.
Joc. You may as well read it aloud—we are all friends here.
Lou. Oh yes, all friends.
Pin. “I have been seized by a patrole of the leaguers: they found in my pocket the heads of my speech, as king of the fête—this excited suspicion, they are sending me, panniers, mule, and all, to head quarters. As you cannot read this, shew it to Pinceau.”

[Page 24]
Lou. There! you see we understood it.
Joc. Now here's a terrible affair! all at sixes and sevens!
Pin. [50]   Yes, the house, and goods.
Joc. Oh! there's no difficulty about that—I'll take possession of all he has, with pleasure; but then, the fête—my dances—what's to become of that?
Lou. And my fine dress, à la Gabrielle.
Joc. A royal fête, and no king? was there ever anything so—Eh? who have we here?
Lou. Two troopers.
Joc. They seem of the king's party; but there's no trusting to appearances.
Lou. They look about them suspiciously.
Pin. And may be some of Mayenne's beaten troops. Stand close—let us reconnoitre. [they stand apart.]
Enter Henri and Sully, disguised as Soldiers. Sully. Sire, 'tis my duty to warn you of the imprudence you commit.
Henri. But our disguise is perfect; besides, the character of a soldier is not new to me.
Sully. True, sir, in yesterday's battle you acted the part of a soldier with credit: your sword was laced with the crimson stains of victory.
Henri. Aye, Sully; but alas! it was a subject's blood, and I washed it with my tears—no more of
[Page 25]
the victory—modesty and humanity unite in bidding us forget it.
Sully. [75]   But, sire, this adventure—
Henri. 'Tis my natal day—every soldier has his holiday then, don't grudge me mine.
Sully. But, advancing before your army so far,—
Henri. Is the best way to know the disposition of my people; either to enjoy their demonstrations of attachment , or to take the hand of him, who has wandered , and gently lead him back into the path of duty and allegiance. Hush! some of the canton— shall we address them?
Sully. No—stand on the defensive —let them open the parley—we shall better know their dispositions.
Henri. Still the prudent Sully. [smiling, and putting his hand on Sully's shoulder.]
Pin. I'll interrogate them.—Now, mind—Hem!—hem!— eh!—what!— [they all look at Henri with wonder.]
Joc. Amazing!
Lou. How striking!
Sully. You are known—
                                         apart. Henri. Hush!
                                         apart. Lou. Did you ever see?
Joc. 'Tis uncle Gervais himself.
Henri. —Uncle Gervais! do you comprehend? [Sully shakes his head.]
Pin. But don't stop the interrogatory—Hem! [100]   Where do you come from?
Sully. The camp.

[Page 26]
Pin. That's an answer, certainly.
Joc. And a short one.
Pin. I'll be short too. [keenly.] Were you never in the ranks of Henri's enemies?
Henri. Often.
Pin. Ah! ah! [consequentially.]
Henri. But they never could keep me there.
Joc. Good again!
Pin. What's your employment?
Sully. Our duty.
Pin. But what do you do?
Henri. Not always what I wish .
Sully. One point of duty we punctually observe —never to answer impertinent questions.
Pin. The interrogatory is finished.
Joc. I have it! such a brilliant thought has just flashed across my brain! Observe, [bowing to Henri and Sully] soldiers, and gallants, we are the loyal inhabitants of this canton. Look! there's Henri's picture. [pointing to the sign.]
Sully. We have fallen among friends.
                                         apart Henri. When shall I call all my subjects by that name?
                                         apart Sully. [125]   When all your subjects know you.
                                         apart Pin. Aye, gentle sirs, what say you to that painting?
Sully. The design is admirable.
Pin. Should it chance to meet the royal eye, it may save Henri the trouble of sending to Reubens, to decorate the Louvre.

[Page 27]
Joc. Now my dear couple of troopers, (taking the arm of each) know that to-day we celebrate the birth-day of the good Henri. The inhabitants of Clichy, Vilette, Belleville , are all pouring in with flags, garlands, and music;—but such a dreadful misfortune has occurred! Uncle Gervais, whom you have the honor of resembling, was to have represented the King , on account of his likeness to him; but the damned leaguers have got hold of his Majesty, and we are in a state of absolute despair; 'tis true, I could supply his place, as far as supporting the character with dignity ; but it must strike you, if you have ever seen the King, that I am—
Henri. Too young .
Joc. And too handsome ; as for Henri's beauty, God bless him! all you can say, is, handsome is, that handsome does. (Henri and Sully laugh apart) —Now, my honest trooper, you look like a good- [150]   natured fellow,—if you would but consent to take uncle Gervais's place, I'll propose you.
Henri. I, as King !
Joc. You'll be very awkward at it, no doubt; but I'll instruct you.
Henri. This hits my humour marvellously. I accept the throne.
Joc. That is, if the people choose you.
Henri. Without it, I will never sit there. (with emphasis.)
Joc. But what's your name?
Henri. Luckily , Henri.

[Page 28]
Joc. Good again . Well, now for your instructions. —You know the King?
Henri. Hem! not sufficiently.
Joc. Do you?
Sully. (with emphasis) Thoroughly. [Henri smiles, and looks at Sully on his answer.)
Joc. Then, you know he must swear a good round hand. (pointing to Henri.)
Henri. Ventre St. Gris!
Joc. That's the King's oath—Oh! he'll do!
Lou. And, Mr. Soldier, you must be very gallant.
Henri. Oh! fear me not.
Joc. For Henri's a devil of a fellow among the wenches.
Sully. [175]   What a libellous varlet! (sarcastically)
                                         apart. Henri. I perceive you think so.
                                         apart. Pin. But, hold! hold! are you sure you have no disloyal blood about you? No taint of the republican?
Sully. If he have, only anoint him king, and I'll warrant that will cure him.—The recipe's infallible.
Joc. Your comrade there is no fool .
Henri. He is not thought one.
Joc. Well, you're king, that's settled.
Henri. Would it were.
Joc. And here's your Gabrielle.— (shewing Louisson)

[Page 29]
Henri. I would not wish a sweeter—let me kiss her.
Joc. Stop, if you please;—you are not yet crowned .
Henri. True; but—ha! ha! ha!—but won't you want a Sully ? Here's my comrade—ha! ha! (pointing to Sully.)
Joc. Oh! we've got a Sully, much better than he. Little Pinceau here, is to be the great Sully—he, who painted the King's head so admirably.
Henri. Good, i'faith! for who is so fit to be minister , as he , who has made the king's head what it ought to be? Eh, comrade, what say you ?
Sully. That such an achievement deserves to be exceedingly well rewarded. (sarcastically.)
Henri. [200]   Indeed!
Joc. Remember, noon is the time.
Henri. When you hear the distant bell of Notre Dame call all the hypocrites of Paris to mass, then expect me . 'Till then , farewell, my buxom, gay, and charming Gabrielle.
Lou. Oh! he's worth a hundred of uncle Gervais.
                                         [Henry and Sully going. Joc. Stop, here come our neighbours. Messieurs of the ballet, where are you? Enter Peasants and Dancers. Now I'll propose you to the people—mark!

[Page 30]
Finale. Jocrisse. (Burlesque Recitative.)
Friends, patriots, Gauls, bold in my country's service
I here propose, in place of uncle Gervais,
This trooper brave our Grand Monarque to be;
Has he your voices? has he your voices? Chorus.
   Yes, yes, we all agree.
Allegiance we swear to his high commands,
Bold are our hearts, and steady are our hands. Louison.
Henri, adieu!—my King, farewell!
Do not forget your Gabrielle. Louison.
Remember the signal—you join the throng.
When Notre-Dame tolls out ding dong. Chorus.
Remember the signal, &c.                                          [Exeunt.

END OF THE FIRST ACT.

[Page 31]
ACT II. SCENE I.                                          A Terrace in the Garden of General D'Aumont at Meudon.—The View from the Terrace displays the old Bridge of Sevre, with the Seine meandring through the Valley. Enter Florence and Page. Duet. Florence.
My pretty Page, look out afar,
Hear you the thunder of the war? Page.
No, fairest Lady, all is still,
Save shepherds' pipes upon the hill. Florence.
My pretty Page, look out again—
See you no warrior on the plain? Page.
The lowing herds I only see,
And cow-boy whistling o'er the lea. Florence.
Leave me I pray; Page.
Don't send me away;
I shall weep, if you do;
For I love you as well as I know who. Florence.
As you know who? Page.
Yes, yes, as I know who. Florence.
Oh fie! go and play. Page.
Must I go? well a-day!
[Page 32]
Enter Clotilde. Clo. My dear Florence, your uncle, general D'Aumont is arrived.
Flo. I rejoice to hear it.
General D'Aumont without. D'Aum. On the terrace, did you say?
Ser. (without) Yes, general, shall I announce you?
D'Aum. No, no, (entering.) my heart will find her—my arms will clasp her. Ah, Florence! [25]   my joy—my pride! (embraces her.) stand off, and let me gaze! What health and beauty! Something in the roll of the eye very like mine— and I had just such a dimple 'till a damned sabre took me across the cheek—there's a smile! pity I must mar it. (taking her hand.) I have seen your brother Frederic—he is rather indisposed—wounded—
Flo. & Clo. (advancing.) Wounded!
D'Aum. Another sweet creature interested in his fate. [apart.] An attachment no doubt. [Florence nods assent.] Who may I thank for the kind interest taken in Frederic's safety? [taking Clotilde's hand.]
Flo. Clotilde de Biron, sister of Eugene! [on hearing her name the general throws her hand from him with indignation.] General! what, a French
[Page 33]
cavalier, bearing the honours of chivalry, to insult a lady?
D'Aum. I was wrong—very wrong. By spur and spear I deserve to have my brains beat out with my own truncheon. I humbly ask your pardon. (bowing to Clotilde.) But, my dear Florence, you will own I have some cause of irritation, when you hear that my nephew was provoked to a duel by the ungoverned temper of that lady's brother, and wounded by him.
Flor. & Clo. [50]   By Eugene!
D'Aum. But not dangerously; he's weak from loss of blood, that's all the mischief. Luckily, I arrived time enough to prevent the affair being reported to the king, or dreadful consequences—
Flor. Where is my dear brother?
D'Aum. At hand—he only waited 'till I had broke the matter to you. I'll bring him to you, poor fellow!
                                         [Exit General D'Aumont. Clo. My brother to seek the valued life of St. Leon! I cannot pardon it.
Flo. My lover to be guilty of the blood of my brother! I'll never forgive him.
Enter O'Donnel, leading in Eugene, who conceals his face. D'Aumont follows. O'Don. Mind, don't betray yourself. (O'Donnel bows to the ladies, and puts his finger on his lips, in token of silence.

[Page 34]
Clo. What should that mean?
D'Aum. Take courage, Frederic, for there have been tears shed for you, worthy of embalming the wounds of Bayard himself.
(Eugene advances, and looks up.) Flor. Eugene!
Clo. My brother!
D'Aum. Well, what's the matter with you all? are you struck dumb? Florence, why don't you give your brother a kiss? Frederic, throw your arms about your sister's neck, you ungrateful dog!
(Eugene and Florence embarrassed.) O'Don. [75]   Consider, General, Frederic's antagonist is her lover.
D'Aum. But, zounds! is that to prevent her shewing her affection to a wounded brother? A brother, that was not too blame?
Eug. No, Florence— Eugene was alone culpable.
D'Aum. To be sure he was. (apart) Not that its very delicate in him to say so. But will you kiss your brother, or will you not?
O'Don. Do , you'll not miss it, and it would be so wholesome for him, make all his blood rush back to his heart, and so stop the bleeding.
Flor. I—I— (Eugene salutes her.)
D'Aum. I—I—, here's a fuss indeed, with brother and sister! It would be natural enough for that pretty soul, (pointing to Clotilde) to conceal her motions, because, with lovers, a little shyness is a
[Page 35]
becoming delicacy. (Clotilde weeping, rushes into Eugene's arms) Shyness! Egad, not much of that.
Clo. Rash, unkind Eugene!
D'Aum. Rash Eugene !—Yes, there we're all agreed—but brave, generous Frederic ! (slapping his shoulder.)
Eug. Yes, generous Frederic indeed!
D'Aum. He to praise himself! Come, that's cool, or the devil's in't! This is all beyond my comprehension. [100]   Why, the art military, with all its evolutions and zigzageries is intelligible, compared with the approaches, manœuvres, masked batteries, and devildoms, of your sentimental, sighing, and sympathizing lovers. (to O'Donnel) I say, did you, in your way through the chateau, smell any thing like preparations for an assault on a good dinner?
O'Don. Upon my honor I did not; and I think the staunchness and sagacity of a hungry subaltern's nose, in Henri's half-starved army, may be depended on.
D'Aum. My dear niece, this affecting scene has proved too much for my unhappy nerves! I feel such a tremor and faintness, as induces me, with all delicacy, to ask—Is dinner ready?
Flor. Indeed, sir, the anticipated pleasure of your arrival, made me forget.
D'Aum. I understand—your excessive love for your dear uncle, induced you to do every thing in your power to starve him. Hollo! there—Germain!
[Page 36]
Frontin! Nicholas! (to O'Donnel) Let's you and I be off on a foraging party—there was some delicious wine in the cellar, and if my absence has improved the flavour—
O'Don. [125]   I dare say, general, you'll find every thing improved by your absence—
D'Aum. Stay.—Here, Frederic, are your papers, which I ordered to be seized— (gives him commission and papers) If you can be cured by honied words, and balmy sighs, stay where you are; but if you think, the more sanative plan would be the application of the wing of a capon, and a bumper of Burgundy to the part grieved, (rubbing his stomach) then, follow us, my boy!
                                         [Exeunt General and O'Donnel. Clo. Explain this mystery!
Flor. I die with impatience!
Eug. After our unhappy rencontre, Frederic fled,—taking, by mistake, my mantle;—hence, these papers were supposed by the general to be mine. I was innocent of the deception, for I had fainted.—
Flor. Fainted, Eugene?
Clo. But the cause of your quarrel?
Eug. Reports had reached me, staining Frederic's honor. He refused an explanation—I felt my friendship insulted—
Clo. Your pride, Eugene. (with emphasis.)
Flor. The name of St. Leon coupled with dishonour, and by you?
Eug. Spare me, Florence, your frowns are more
[Page 37]
[150]   piercing than your brother's sword. Return these papers to my friend—I call him by that name—for he will not withhold his pardon. (giving papers.) What's this? A letter addressed to him im my father's character!
Clo. 'Tis certainly his writing.
Eug. 'Tis open—have I your permission to examine its contents? (to Florence.)
Flor. Certainly, sir—my brother would receive no commnnication his sister need fear to publish.
Eug. “Accept the gratitude of an imprudent, but repentant father—you have restored my liberty—you have redeemed my honour.” Was it for my father he became implicated with gamesters? And my gratitude was, to urge my sword against his life! (hides his face.)
Clo. Noble Frederic! (takes the letter.)
Flor. Dear, excellent brother.
Clo. “What compensation can I offer? My Clotilde must thank you. Keep this transaction a secret from Eugene, his pride, his haughty spirit”—
Eug. Enough, enough. (leans on Clotilde.)
Clo. When that haughty spirit has stooped to obtain pardon of St. Leon—then claim the affection [175]   of a sister.
                                         [Exit. Eug. Spare and pity me.
Flor. And is not my pity worth asking for?

[Page 38]
Ballad.— Florence .
Soldier, do thy wounds now grieve thee,
And sorrow of all hope bereave thee;
Hapless lover, dost thou languish
Of jealous pangs to feel the anguish;
'Tis pity's tear from woman's eye
Must heal the wound, and hush the sigh.                                          [Exit Florence. Enter General D'Aumont, with an opened letter in his hand. D'Aum. 'Tis an unjust preference; the king has done me wrong. In what action was Frederic ever behind Eugene in noble daring? Are my services too forgotten?—Did Henri know how well Eugene has merited his partial favor? Frederic, I have received news, that will severely try your boasted philosophy:—his Majesty has been pleased to pass over your services, by assigning to Eugene a command of high honor and enterprize.
Eug. Ah! the orders of the king! (he instinctively searches his mantle, then recollects the change, and is overwhelmed with confusion.
D'Aum. Come, come, don't take it so to heart.
Eug. Fatal infatuation! Eternal dishonor! (addressing the General, scarcely able to articulate) — Know you, General, the particular service, to which the king has destined him?

[Page 39]
D'Aum. To force the passage of the Marne, and [200]   so unite the two armies. By this time the enterprize has either failed, or succeeded; if Eugene has fallen, he dies honored and beloved;—if victorious, he will be hailed his country's best champion.
Eug. Into what perdition have my passions plunged me!
D'Aum. Ah, Frederic, think of the effects of vindicating private quarrels, to the neglect of those of your country. Suppose the King had selected you for the service; and you, by your wounds, had been unable to discharge it—What would have been your feelings?
Eug. Terrible—insupportable! (apart) My name tainted—my love blasted—my honor lost—for ever lost!— [rushes out.]
D'Aum. Hollo! Frederic! Come back! He's gone—they are all bewitched! This castle is enchanted, and I shall soon become the ogre. Why Frederic—niece—Florence—
Enter O'Donnel, looking off. O'Don. Now here's a pretty affair! Frederic's galloping up the avenue, little thinking he has been here this half hour. What's to be done? Why, as Eugene is Frederic, Frederic must be Eugene. Oh, that's as transparent as the Liffy, when it an't muddy, which it always is. Besides, it would be mighty [225]   wrong to load the old general with nephews, one
[Page 40]
o'top of t'other. Well, general, the dinner is serving, and a new guest arrived—Eugene de Biron.
D'Aum. Eugene dare to set his foot here? More witchcraft!
O'Don. I'll go and try to give him his cue. [going] Oh, he's here!
Enter Frederic. Fred. My uncle here! (addressing him.) My dear sir, receive my warmest congratulations on your arrival in France.
D'Aum. Sir, I hope I feel as I ought your —dam'me, if his impudence don't make me blush.
Fred. Of course, you have seen the ladies.
D'Aum. Oh yes, I have had that pleasure.
Fred. And my wounded friend quite recovered, I hear.
D'Aum. Oh, quite. (aside.) How easy and agreeable!
Fred. I hope, general, you will acquit me of all blame. [O'Donnel pulls Frederic by the mantle.]
D'Aum. A very modest request, upon my soul!
Enter Florence and Clotilde, they run to Frederic. Flor. Now my fears are past.

[Page 41]
Clo. And my happiness assured. [they all go up, talking, winking, and tittering.]
D'Aum. [250]   Is not this enough to make patience herself jump up, and kick the other cardinal virtues to the devil? When my wronged and wounded nephew came, they would not condescend to speak to him—and here they are hugging this impudent, hot-headed—Eh? (observing them) What? Winking! tittering! fingers to lips! I've a great notion they have been making me a most egregious ass! By pretending to have hold of the clue, I may thread the labyrinth. [to them.] I can nod and wink too—and so, the old put was to be made your dupe?
Flor. Ha! ha! I thought you would find us out. [General smiles and nods.]
Clo. But the imposition was absolutely necessary.
D'Aum. Indeed!
Flor. For, had you known it was Eugene you found wounded, your resentment—
D'Aum. Why, zounds, sir, did not you tell me it was Frederic that was killed?
O'Don. On the contrary , general, it was you that told me so. I own, I rather doubted it, because I was certain to the contrary; but, was it for a poor devil of a subaltern to pretend to know better than the general [275]   himself? No, no, I hope I understand subordination better than that. I say, general, as you are
[Page 42]
so fond of making relations, could not you make me a nephew, or a niece, or something?
D'Aum. Why, I searched his mantle.
Fred. Which mantle was mine ! And from that has arisen those events which have been most fortunate to all. Yes, (to Clotilde) by that , I have proved myself Eugene's best friend, by that I boldly claim the gratitude of Clotilde.
Flor. Explain, dear Frederic.
Fred. Possessed of Eugene's commission, and the accompanying orders of the King, I hastened to achieve the glorious enterprize, his wounds disabled him from executing.
D'Aum. Ha! ha! Go on!
Fred. Inspired by the courage of the hero I represented, and supported by the intrepid ardor of my companions in arms, we— (checking himself, and adding with modest calmness) happily succeeded in executing the orders of the King—and the armies are now united.
O'Don. Huzza!—
D'Aum. My brave nephew!
Flor. My dearest brother!
Clo. [300]   My faithful protector! my brother's saviour! my own beloved Frederic! (Falls into his arms)
D'Aum. Aye, aye, this accounts for Eugene's distraction—from my heart, I pity the poor fellow,— he rushed out.
Fred. My care has provided for all—messengers are dispatched to find him—the honors of the victory
[Page 43]
will be his—my honored reward, the hand of Clotide.
D'Aum Aye, and this very night, the priest shall be summoned—nay, I'll have it so.—I see they are making preparations to celebrate my return— we'll convert them to a nuptial feast.
Fred. What says my Clotide?
Clo. I were unworthy of my happiness, did I deny your wishes; but my brother's presence must sanctify the solemn contract.
Fred. By all means. My joys would be imperfect without the presence of my friend. Come, Clotide, we'll hasten his return. (taking her hand.)
O'Don. Let me be the messenger.
Fred. And this day, whose morning was clouded with war and discord, shall see its evening close in the mild radiance of hallowed love, and festive harmony.
O'Don. Upon my honor, Frederic, this scene has [325]   made me such a convert to peace and quietness, that I would not advise any body to let me hear them say a word against it. (putting his hand to his sword.— The ladies laugh) Sure, and have I made a blunder? —Never mind—for, though an Irishman's head may sometimes be on the wrong side, his heart is always sure to be on the right.
                                         [Exeunt O'Donnel, Frederic, and Clotilde. D'Aum. Now, for preparations. Here, Germain! Frontin! La Fleur! Nicolas!

[Page 44]
Enter Servants. Receive my commands—mark!
Quintetto. General.
Spread the board—let festivity reign,
   Assemble the youth and the fair; Page.
I'll quickly their presence obtain,
   With a smile, and a bow debonaire. General.
Give the welcome of heart, and of truth. Florence.
The care of that welcome be mine;
   The song and the dance for the youth, General,
For the aged the feast and the wine. Florence.
Thus her seasons kind nature disposes,
   Her children's joys to refine!
For in Spring she produces her roses,
   And in Autumn she ripens the vine.
[Page 45]
SCENE II. A French Village.—A rural Throne is erected, which is brought forward by the peasants. Enter Jocrisse, in his holiday Garments. Joc. Bravo! admirable! Place the table here! Now the wine.—Where are the 20 sous worth of cakes for the royal banquet? (they are brought) — Very well.
                                         Enter Pinceau, dressed as Sully, leading in Louison, as Gabrielle, attended by female Peasants. Joc. Charming Gabrielle, worthy a monarch's smile—nay more, worthy of my heart! Ah, Sully,—but, zounds, man! off with your spectacles.—Why, you would not, in these times, give the King a short-sighted Minister, would you? (distant bell) Hark! the bell of Notre Dame, and here comes the trooper, as King of the Fête. What a capital dress he has borrowed!—he's a thousand times handsomer than Gervais.

[Page 46]
Enter Henri and Sully, preceded by Dancers, with Tamborines, Cymbals, &c. Chorus.
   Live, Henri Quatre!
      Long live our valiant king!
   His triple art
      Right loyally we'll sing.
He'll never shrink, who has the rare talent,
To fight and drink, and be a gay gallant. Henri. Happiness to my people, and health to my Gabrielle! (seats himself on the rural Throne. Pinceau on one side of the table—Gabrielle on the other. Sully stands between, before Henri. (To Gabrielle.) Nearer, nearer! (takes her hand, and toys with it.)
Joc. Have you no more respect for your character?
Lou. [25]   An't I supporting it? How dare you, fellow, address the favorite of the king?
(Henri smiles, and continues his attentions. Joc. Sully, you old fool, why don't you prevent the King taking such liberties?—don't you know, your place at court, is to see he don't misbehave himself?
Henri (to Sully) What think you of your new office?
Sully. (to Henri.) I think it will be no sinecure.

[Page 47]
Pin. Health to the great Henri!
Lou. To the good Henri!
Joc. And to his children!
Sully. (significantly) Wherever they may.
Joc. Now, you must make a speech in praise of yourself,—that is, of the King.
Henri. In praise of the King! I—I—I don't know what to say.—Can you assist me? (to Sully.)
Sully. (coolly) No.
Joc. You won't make a speech; then I will. Our monarch, so very great—so very noble—so very wise—
Henri. So very patient—so very weary.— (seats himself.)
Joc. Like Alexander—
Henri. No more.
Joc. Like Alexander—
Henri. [50]   Cease this jargon!
Joc. Jargon!
Henri. Henri hates flattery worse than he hates the league. Proceed with the sports. (seats himself.)
Joc. Now, Louison, you must charm him with such a strain as first melted my heart.
Song— Louison.

Fear, ne'er assail me;
Hands, do not fail me;
Harp, breathe thy gladness;
Heart, cease thy sadness.
[Page 48]


Boldly let me sweep the string;
Wild as the woodlark let me sing,
While to my Henri's ear I tell
The love of simple Gabrielle. Joc. Bravo! delightful!—but now comes the awful moment.
Sully. You seem agitated.
Joc. Sympathize with the feelings of an author! I've composed a ballet. Ah, sir, learned clerks may write books, and statesmen, treatises;—but set your doctors of the Sorbonne, or one of your Sullys, to make a dance, how they would expose themselves!
Sully. Most likely.
Gervais sings without.
See your king's come home,
He no longer will roam. Enters, singing. Ger. [75]   Here I am, at last—wheugh! [wiping his forehead.]
All. Gervais!
Ger. But, hey-day! what's all this? My throne usurped! Death and vengeance on the traitor!
Henri. My rival!
Lou. His coming back has spoiled every thing.
Pin. Be temperate, neighbour—you were not here; and, really, considering all things, he has done pretty well.

[Page 49]
Ger. As well as me, I suppose.
Lou. A thousand times better.
Ger. Will you resign the throne?
Henri. I own, friend, there have been moments when I would have done so with pleasure, but this is not one.
Ger. Come out, then, and face me like a man. [they restrain him.]
Henri. Is then, ambition the vice of kings only ? That man would shed blood for the ephemeral sceptre of an hour.
Joc. Nay, but uncle Gervais—
Ger. What are your pretensions?
Henri. Ventre St. Gris! pretensions! that in loving, drinking, and fighting, I will not yield to Henri kimself.—
All. [100]   Bravo! bravo!
Joc. There,—you hear the public voice is against you, be quiet, and tell us how you escaped the Leaguers?
Ger. How! egad, the Leaguers were glad to escape from me.—
Henri. What say you?
Ger. What say I? why, I say, the passage of the Marne is forced—the brave Crillon is in full march to join the king—the Leaguers are in full rout to avoid him.
All. Huzza!
                                         [Exeunt Peasants. Henri. Come hither. [he gives orders, whispers, and points off. Sully bows and exit]

[Page 50]
Ger. Did you observe? A blessed choice you have made—a spy—an enemy!
Pin. Why I own, he came in a suspicious way.
Joc. And he called my speech in favour of Henri jargon—a proof he was as deficient in loyalty, as in taste.
Ger. Some great rebel—with what authority he ordered out his companion!
Joc. You are right—he must be secured—I'll seize him, but elegantly. Sir, [to Henri.] I feel highly gratified in having you arrested in the king's [125]   name.
Henri. Arrest! I appertain to the court!
Ger. Is that true?
Henri. I never spoke a falsehood!
Joc. And a courtier! Come, that's a thumper, however.
Henri. I promise you—
Joc. Promise! Oh, he is a courtier—but, with all due submission, if you would have the goodness to take yourself immediately to prison, you would very much oblige the company.
Henri. 'Sdeath! I shall be killed here with their kindness for me.
Joc. Allow me the pleasure of collaring you. [takes the king by the collar.] Loyal subjects, assist me to drag this personage to jail, with all the respect that's due to him. [Shouts without.]

[Page 51]
Enter Sully, introducing Crillon and Generals. Crillon. [kneels.] Sire!
                                         [Jocrisse, trembling, withdraws his hand, and with Pinceau, Gervais, and Louison, retire to a corner of the Stage. Henri. [raising Crillon, and tapping him on the shoulder.] Go, hang thyself for spite, brave Crillon, for, yesterday, I gained a victory without thee—but now, we shall again combat side by side. Sully, I was right in my man—Eugene de Biron has justified my choice. You were all for St Leon—summon our council—advance my standard even to the walls of rebellious Paris, there fix my tent. Ah, ha! [150]   [looking at the group trembling in the corner.]
Pin. Let the petticoat go first—we'll advance under its shelter.
Sully. A good general—he knows the feeble side of the enemy.
Joc., Ger., Pin. Pardon!
Henri. From my very heart—My rival, there's my hand, and, (kissing Louison,) this is the kiss of peace.
Joc. The king has saluted my wife. After that, there's no knowing what may happen! that's the royal cheek—this shall be mine. Happy
[Page 52]
Jocrisse! the only man in France who has dared to have had the honor of collaring his majesty.
Henri. You must not be jealous.
Joc. Oh, no!
Lou. But he was though. [pouting.]
Joc. To be sure—jealous of inferiors—but attentions to one's wife from people of equal merit with one's self, makes all the difference, you know.
Henri. Certainly. (to Louison significantly) I shall appoint your husband to some place near my person. (Sully betrays surprise.)
Joc. My dear sir, don't be agitated. I shall make a point of not interfering with you— [175]   tranquillize yourself, my excellent friend.—A worthy, good creature, that Sully.
Henri. Very. Farewell. We shall, I trust, soon meet at the Louvre.
Joc. At the Louvre!
Lou. Ah! but what chance have we of gaining access to your majesty there?
Henri. Here's my signet. [places a ring on her finger, and kisses her hand] Now to council. Brave Crillon, once more welcome.
                                         [Exeunt Henri and train. Ger. Come, neighbours, let's home and drain the cellar to the health of Henri. Lucky was the moment when I put up the royal sign!
Pin. And propitious was the hour when this masterly hand achieved it.
Lou. Jocrisse, [shaking her finger, with the ring
[Page 53]
on] look here!
Joc. Only to think—my wife keeper of the privy seal!
                                         [Exeunt Jocrisse, Pinceau and Peasants. Lou. I say, uncle, I'll have diamond buckles to my wooden shoes, and sell my butter and eggs in a golden coach, ha! ha!
Ger. So you shall. But when Henri enters Paris there'll be a day for us all.
Duet. Gervais.
Oh, what a gay and joyous scene!
[200]      While we, so debonaire,
With merry pipe and tambourine,
   To Paris strait repair.
      Comme ça, comme ça, comme ça. Louison.
Behold, with condescending hand,
   Bedeck'd with jewels gay,
I, smilingly, with grace demand,
   “Pray sir, is this the way?”
      Merci, merci, merci! Gervais.
There valiant Knights in tournament,
   Shall combat for the prize. Louison.
And lovely dames, on conquest bent,
   Shall conquer with their eyes.
[Page 54]
Both.
With courtly leg so tapering
   We'll lead the jocund dance;
Oh! what nation dare, in capering,
   E'er hope to equal France?
Oh, what a gay, &c.                                          [Exeunt. SCENE III. A VIEW OF THE TOWN AND ABBEY OF ST. DENIS. Enter Eugene.                                          [A trumpet sounds in the distance. Eug. How art thou fallen! the trumpets's call, which used to swell this heart with tumultuous joy, now withers and makes it shrink within itself. Perhaps the valiant troop I was destined to command, have been surprised, defeated—and expiring, curse their coward leader. Oh, Frederic, had but thy sword been merciful, and reached my life—but it was justice that I should live to taste the bitterness of dishonor. [remains desolate, his eye fixed on the earth.]
Enter Henri and Crillon. Henri. By my beard, this gallant achievement of De Biron merits highly our thanks. I would not lose him for the fairest jewel in my crown.

[Page 55]
Eug. The King!
Henri. Ah, brave Eugene! the brightest success has crowned your efforts.—See, Crillon stands by my side! This day's triumph places you in the first file of renown and valor. It may not be unwelcome for you to know, it was I , who selected you for the service. Follow to my tent, there your king will thank you.
                                         [Exeunt Henri, Sully, and Crillon. Eug. Am I awake? Success has crowned the enterprize.—Honor and Eugene's name united!—Blest vision, let me grasp thee! 'tis fled, and leaves me desolate and abandoned. [25]   The king knows the truth, and thus upbraids. No, no—the good Henri may punish , but he cannot insult , the wretched. Yet Crillon I saw—
Enter Germain, running. Ger. Well encountered, captain! an army of messengers have been sent out to seek you—a letter from St. Leon. (Eugene takes it carelessly.) I am sorry to see you look so pale—your wound—
Eug. Yes, yes.
Ger. What, worse?
Eug. No, I mistook—well—quite well— (opens the letter and starts) Ah! conquered in my name! the mystery's explained! generous, noble Frederic! —reads— “The sword, that wounded my friend, could only atone by fighting his battles—keep the secret, dearest Eugene—it will secure the felicity
[Page 56]
of all—make us happy by your presence—your sister demands it—your Florence”— (Is overcome by his feelings, then to Germain with quickness) Return!—say this letter has delighted me—I'll obey their wishes—my joyful greetings to my sister—to my love—away! [Exit Germain.] Keep the secret! What! bind round this recreant, and withering brow, the verdant and immortal wreath of loyalty and valor? No, Frederic—prostrate as my honor's laid, still with disdain it spurns the thought of robbing victory of its meed, and friendship of its triumph—bear up, [50]   proud heart—sustain me in this last effort!—Now to the King! (rushes off.)
SCENE IV. THE ROYAL TENT. Henri discovered examining a Plan of Attack. Henri. This plan of attack is ably formed, and would lay rebellious Paris in ashes—But no—proud seat of my ancestors, I'll not destroy thee! I'll enter thy gates through files of living subjects, not trampling over carcasses. (throwing down the plan) Here's a more cheering paper—my proposed terms of peace. [seats himself.]
Moustache. [without.] I demand an audience.

[Page 57]
Guard. You cannot enter.
Moustache. [without.] Only three words.
Henri. Guard, admit that laconic intruder. Enter Moustache. Speak—but mind, sirrah, only three words.
Mou. Pay, or discharge.
Henri. Take five in return. Neither one nor the other.
Mou. Then I know what follows.
Henri. Name it.
Mou. Mutiny.
Henri. What do you want?
Mou. Money! food!
Henri. Food! I thought fighting took away a coward's appetite. (irritated.)
Mou. Coward! (claps his hand on his sword, strikes his breast, and rushes out.)
Henri. I am seldom touched with anger—curse on [25]   its influence—I've broken that noble fellow's heart! Moustache! Moustache, I say! Guard, send him back! Re-enter Moustache. Hot-headed, insolent varlet—not to have patience to hear your king finish his sentence. I said fighting took away a coward's appetite—
Mou. You did!
Henri. But was about to add—it made a brave fellow as hungry as a tyger! sit down—you shall
[Page 58]
feast with me on a royal banquet—sit down, I say!                                          [Moustache seats himself, Henri goes out and returns with some wine and two goblets, and a piece of coarse bread, which he throws on the table. There, that's all they allow me—the same batch as your's, I fancy—but I don't grumble. Come, let's touch glasses—and swallow down our mischievous anger. [Moustache trembling with joy, advances his glass to Henri—they drink.] Are we friends?
Mou. Friends—I'll cry a bit, and then I'll tell you.
Henri. Well remembered—you've had enough of toil, old soldier— [takes a pen and writes.] The military prison—you shall be governor of—there's your appointment. (giving a paper.)
Mou. So—jailer! That, I suppose, is because I am old and savage—
Henri. No—it is—that, under the shaggy main of a lion, is concealed the heart of a lamb!
Mou. I can't thank you—only let me hear the [50]   least murmur against my king in my troop—
Henri. And if you do—forgive it, as I have done.                                          [Exit Moustache. Jeanne of Navarre, my honoured mother, used wisely to say, a spoonful of honey catches more flies, than a tun of vinegar. (sits down and writes.) In faith, I'm weary. Intestine discord, when wilt thou cease to stain the fair fields of France, with its children's blood? Ah, my country, thou wilt love me when I no longer live! (the hand holding the pen falls by his side.)

[Page 59]
Enter Sully. Sully. I disturb your majesty.
Henri. I own, sleep had nearly overpowered me.
Sully. Cæsar seldom slept.
Henri. Cæsar sleep! how should he, amidst the groans of victims sacrificed to his ambition? Let me emulate the clemency of Titus. I tell thee, Sully, I've made my confessor place an additional bead on my rosary, that I may not forget daily to thank Heaven, that I am no Conqueror!—The opiate that brings me sleep, is the thought that my poorest subject lies under his humble thatch contented and secure!
Enter Officer. Offi. Sire! Eugene de Biron attends your orders.
Henri. Admit him, and call in my officers—I wish them to witness my tribute to his valour. (enter officer, Eugene, and officers) Eugene, approach! [75]   —I sent not for you to reward your services—that shall be my care hereafter, but to offer you a testimony of my love. Here is my picture—let me rest near your heart, Eugene—you will always lie near mine. [offering the miniature, which Eugene shrinks from receiving] Ah! do you refuse my love?
Eug. Yes,—for I am only worthy of your hate— There's the confession of my disloyalty—spare me the recital. (presents a paper.)

[Page 60]
Henri. What's this? (looks at Eugene, then at the paper, and again at Eugene) A duel!—the conquering troops commanded by St. Leon! (gives the paper to Sully—pointing to the writing) And is this, then, the Eugene, whom I selected as my hero?
Eug. Yes, who preferred plunging his sword into the heart of his friend, to vindicating the honor of his king.
Sully. You had not then received the king's orders?
Eng. Yes, but I did not condescend to read them. Noble Henri, behold a suppliant for justice—justice to the brave St. Leon!— his virtues equal my crimes, his loyalty, my treason ! (with bitterness) need I say, they are surpassing? (kneels) On my knees, I implore you to reward his merits (starting up with despair) Erect! I demand the reward of mine
Henri. [100]   From my soul, I pity—
Sully. Sire, the publicity—
Henri. True.
Sully. His fate must teach the soldier, that the march to glory can only be achieved through the rugged path of duty.
Henri. Perform your mournful office.
Sully. Eugene de Biron, render up your sword. (Eugene draws his sword, kisses it, and delivers it.— Sully gives it to an officer, and orders it to be broken —Eugene shudders on hearing the fracture) Conduct him to the Council! (delivers the confession to the officer) I will attend.
                                         [Exit Eugene, guarded by officers.
[Page 61]
Henri. These are the envied joys of kings! (wiping his eyes, and rousing himself) But millions demand my care. (shouts without) What mean those shouts?
Enter Crillon and Soldiers. Cril. The promised aid from England. The gallant Essex, commanding five thousand warriors, has joined your royal standard.
Henri. Noble, generous, Elizabeth! By St. Louis, the Bourbons owe a heavy debt of gratitude to these Islanders!
Cril. They bring with them ample provisions for our distressed army.
Henri. Provisions, say you?— (reflects.) Yes,— it shall be so! Retain a moiety for the use of the [125]   army—and, do you mark—send the remainder to the besieged, in Paris.
Cril. To your rebellious foes?
Henri. To my deluded subjects.
Cril. A few days would make you master of their persons.
Henri. And in one day I'll be master of their hearts.
Cril. Compelling them to surrender, would teach them to fear you.
Henri. I prefer teaching them to love me.
Cril. Yet, sire—
Henri. Crillon, not one word against my people! —but let the malediction fall heavy on those who
[Page 62]
would mislead them!—I repeat—the besieging shall succour the besieged.—See that it instantly be done!
Sully. I accord with the King's opinion.
Henri. Ah! ha!—Do you mark?—Sully agrees me— (with archness) and for the first time these three months.
Sully. That may not be my fault. (bows.)
Henri. Of course, mine!                                          [Exit Crillon. Enter Officer, who delivers a paper. From the brave Montmorenci! (examines it.) Ah, good, excellent news!
Sully. [150]   What! has a victory been gained?
Henri. Better! a battle may be prevented. (reads) “Mayenne makes a stand near St. Germain—But, were the King's standard seen there he would be deserted.”—It shall float there with the morning wind!
Sully. Who shall plant it?
Henri. This good arm!—Come, Sully, to horse! —'Tis but a night passed in riding through the Forest.—I've hunted it, and know each brake and dingle. (affectionately) I'll be thy guide, old Sully— thou hast many a year been mine!— (Trumpet.) But, hark! the English trumpet.—Haste we to receive, and honor the captains of the great Elizabeth!
[Page 63]
Enter Essex and Staff—he kneels to Henri, who raises him. Welcome! thrice welcome! renowned Essex!— honored by the noblest queen that ever graced the regal diadem—By my sword, I love and honor her! Oh, if she were here, I would so thank her, as to make her repent her icy vows of celibacy!— (shouts) Hark! the distant shouts of the besieged!—They share my bounty—they bless their benefactor.—Up with the curtains of my tent, and let me behold the setting sun, gilding with its beams the pride of British chivalry!
SCENE V.                                          [The draperies of the tent are opened, which discover the English Army marshalled—with the English Standard. The Provision waggons are seen in a hollow way, moving towards the gates of Paris. The Walls and City forming the back grounds of the Scene.                                          [Exeunt.


END OF THE SECOND ACT.

[Page 64]
ACT III. SCENE I. INTERIOR OF A PRISON—A CORRIDOR LEADING TO CELLS.                                          Enter Moustache through the Corridor, bearing a bunch of large keys, which he attaches to his girdle. Mou. So, all's secure.—Well! here I'm installed governor of the state prison. The apartments spacious —the walls massy—little danger of prisoners breaking out, and little fear of rogues breaking in. I dare say I shall pass my time here pleasantly enough. To the credit of Henri's army, I have not one military prisoner, and I would not advise any recreant craven to get within my clutch—I'd so curry the rascal.—
Enter Officer. Offi. A prisoner is arrived—an officer of the royal army.
Mou. Of the royal army! Bring in the scoundrel! let me see the poltroon! hand down a choice assortment of the heaviest chains. (noise of chains falling)
Voice. (withont) Room there for the prisoner!
Mou. I'll find room for him, a traiterous—

[Page 65]
Enter Eugene, his eyes abased, escorted by a Military Guard. Mous. Eugene! (during the scene his eyes are riveted on Eugene, who is absorbed in his own feelings.)
Offi. Come, don't be too severe.
Mou. What did you say?
Officer. Don't be too severe.
Mou. Well, I think I won't.
Offi. He's miserable enough.
Mou. He seems so—I say, what's his supposed crime?
Offi. [25]   Supposed! 'tis proved—confessed—he has been arraigned before the council: there's his sentence. (gives a paper.)
Mou. (without) Sentence!
Offi. Take care of him.
Mou. The same as if he were my own child!
Offi. Your own child! I mean, keep him secure.
Mou. I mean so too—go, you have fulfilled your duty to your king, and your conscience—I'll try to fulfil mine.
                                         [Exeunt Officer and Guards. Mou. Prisoner! follow me to your dungeon.— [Moustache opens a door—Eugene advances towards it—raises his eyes.]
Eug. Moustache! my friend
Mou. Friend! I'm not quite sure of that—what's your claim to my friendship?

[Page 66]
Eug. Wretchedness.
Mou. That's a claim to my pity, and you have it. (apart.) I've not the heart to ask him his crime— perhaps this will tell me. (opens the paper.) “A duel—neglect of duty—the victory achieved by St. Leon.”—Curse on that fiery temper! it has undone the noblest, bravest— (strikes his breast.) A minute ago, I said I should pass my time pleasantly here, and now I'm the most miserable dog—
                                         Enter an Officer, who delivers a paper—looks at Eugene—whispres Moustache—and exit. Moustache starts—unfolds the paper— brushes the tear from his eye, but cannot succeed in reading it. Eug. (Advances towards him, calmly points to the paper, and distinctly pronounces) “Eugene de [50]   Biron to be executed to-morrow at eight”—courage my old friend! (tapping his shoulder.)
Mous. Courage! What, and see cut off—the boy I loved—the man I honor—the hero that, I hoped, would lay me in my grave, scatter a few green leaves over it, and, when my comrades fired over me, would say a word or two in favour of old Moustache —courage! The heart of a lion could not stand it.
Eug. If you pity my fate, 'tis in your power to—
Mou. What would you ask? My life? 'Tis your's. A soldier knows how to part with it—but
[Page 67]
he does not know how to part with his fidelity. Could this old trunk be a bulwark to receive the fatal balls, I would—
Eug. And does my friend think so meanly of me, that I would waste a thought on this tainted being, that honor loaths, and even self-love despises? No, 'tis not that—now, listen to me with thy heart.— Happily, my sister is yet ignorant of my fate—you love her—she has nursed you—she healed the wound that caused that honored scar.
Mou. Heaven bless her!
Eug. Heaven has made you its minister to do so. Her happiness or misery rests on you.
Mou. [75]   On me!
Eug. This night she was to become the bride of the generous man who sacrificed his fortune to save her father's honor—who offered up his life to preserve mine.
Mou. St. Leon?
Eug. The same—but the contract cannot be fulfilled.
Mou. That's a pity.
Eug. Is it not?
Mou. But why?
Eug. It must be sanctioned by my presence—tomorrow, (pointing to the warrant of execution) their union will be impossible.
Mou. Your presence?
Eug. My presence! think what I would ask!
Mou. Why, you would not ask to—?

[Page 68]
Eug. On my knees—
Mou. (without) (lost in surprise and embarrassment at the request of Eugene, when, looking at him, he snatches a key from his girdle, and offers it) Go!
Eug. Eternal blessings on you—you have plucked from my heart, the stings of death.
Mou. Go, go—Night falls. (cannon) Hark! the evening gun.—That opens the postern gate. (giving the key.)
Eug. By crossing the forest, I gain the castle by midnight;—long e'er dawn I shall return.
Mou. Return! Ah, that's your business. (apart) [100]   only, if you do not, I can guess what will happen. Take this cloak, it will conceal your figure. A pretty beginning I have made in my new office! Remember, that is your cell.—
Eug. In the morning, there you'll find me. Farewell! (pressing Moustache's hand to his breast) — Rely on my faith, and sleep in peace.
Mou. Sleep, Eugene! and to-morrow—
Eug. You have disrobed it of its terrors; let me but fulfil this night's duty, and I bless the morning beam, that lights me to my fate.
                                         [Exeunt Moustache leading out Eugene.
[Page 69]
SCENE II. AN ILLUMINATED SALOON IN THE CHATEAU OF GENERAL D'AUMONT. Enter Florence and Page. Flor. So, all prepared for the celebration of the marriage. Go, my pretty page, and enquire if Clotide's toilette is finished. (Exit Page) The bridalday —Heigho! what hopes does it not awaken.
Song.— Florence .

The ray of Hope can cheer the heart,
   Make frozen Zembla bloom;
And Freedom's sacred light impart,
   To cheer the dungeon's gloom.

From Atlas' top the eagle springs
   To brave the star of day;
'Tis heav'nly Hope that plumes his wings,
   'Tis Freedom points the way. Enter General D'Aumont, Clotilde, and Frederic. Gen. There, Frederic, is the prize of your valor, the reward of your generosity;—but where's Eugene?
Clo. Doubtless, he will arrive soon; for what stronger impulse can he have, than gratitude to the best of friends?

[Page 70]
Fred. Or affection for the best of sisters.
Gen. Or adoration for the most adorable of mistresses. (in an heroic tone.)
Flor. Or veneration for the most puissant of Generals.
Gen. All powerful motives I own; yet he is not impelled by them—the guests are impatient—even the [25]   lawyers complain of delay; but here they come— Enter Lawyers. Welcome! Gentlemen of the robe, be seated, and proceed, if you please.
Law. The covenants are engrossed, and all is ready for the signatures.
Gen. Here is mine. (signs) These are the contracting parties. (Clotilde and Frederic sign.)
Law. There yet wants another signature.
Gen. I know.
Fred. Eugene's absence alarms me.
Clo, Flor. Alarms you!
Fred. No, no—I meant not that.
Eugene rushes down. Flor. He's here—Eugene!
Clo. My brother!
Fred. My friend!
Flor. You seem exhausted.

[Page 71]
Eug. I've journey'd fast across the forest.
Flor. What! serious business detained you?
Eug. Neither. My beloved sister, this is a pleasure I've tried hard to obtain; but the moments are precious —the contract—
Gen. Only waits your signature.
Eug. Come, then— (signs) 'tis accomplished— my last wish is gratified!
Flor. His last wish is gratified! Indeed!
                                         [Exeunt Lawyers. Eug. [50]   My friend, and, now, my brother, receive from my hand this precious gift; her affection will be the soft solace of your cares; her virtues, the firm stability of your happiness; and, should misfortune deprive her of her brother, comfort and support her. (Clotilde weeps.) Nay, nay, I meant not to excite your tears. General, can you pardon my swerving from a soldier's duty?
Gen. Zounds! if I did not, I must forget, when this blood was as apt to boil, as yours. Pardon you, my brave—, no, I won't—I command you, as a punishment, to appear before this tribunal to-morrow, to be chained to that young vixen for life.
Eug. To-morrow!
Flor. To-morrow! oh, that's too soon—indeed, that's too soon. (ill concealing her joy.)
Eug. I cannot bear her fancied happiness —her smiles distract—her vivacity sinks me to the earth—hark! 'tis midnight—I must return.
Flor. Eugene, you look ill.

[Page 72]
Eug. I feel oppressed and giddy—the air's too close—Might I be allowed to retire to my apartment?
Fred. By all means, my friend.
Gen. No ceremony—lights there!
Clo. I'll attend you.
Eug. [75]   No, dearest Clotilde. I'm sorry I cannot join in your revelry.
Flor. But, in the morning, all your pains will be removed.
Eug. All—bless you, my friend and sister! General, could I but in the field, battle by your side, and prove my devotion to my king—
Gen. Fear not, but our enemies will give us opportunities enough.
Eug. Florence, good night.
Flor. I shall wake you in the morning.
Eug. You may find that difficult.
Flor. There, false man— (fondly pushing him from her.] Have you not often vowed, that my voice could raise you from the grave?
Eug. [unable to endure more, kisses her hand, saying in a hurried tone,] Good night. Bitter, bitter fate!
                                         [Exit. Fred. The remembrance of his absence from duty still weighs on his brave heart.
Gen. I perceive it does. But now, to fulfil the church's rites; which, when performed, let mask, song, and revelry hold their jocund court.

[Page 73]
O'Don. Where's General D'Aumont? I must see him instantly.
Enter O'Donnel. Gen. [100]   Welcome, O'Donnel.
Fred. But, my friend, you are late.
O'Don. No wonder, Frederic,—for I've had to bring along with me a heart, as heavy as the biggest stone in the Giant's Causeway.—I wish it was as hard—for I've news will try the strength of your's.—Heigho!
Fred. The Army?
O'Don. Is safe.
Gen. The King?
O'Don. In health—but Eugene—
Flor. What of Eugene?
O'Don. He is in the Castle.
Gen. I know—in mine.
O'Don. Yours?
Gen. In this chateau.
Fred. At this moment.
O'Don. No, don't—'tis no season for joking.
Fred. See, here's his signature to this contract— the ink scarcely dry.
O'Donnel is silent from astonishment. Clo. My brother found his head confused and giddy, so, retired to his apartment.
Gen. And, really, Captain, I would advise you to do the same,—for you have very aggravated symptoms, ha! ha!

[Page 74]
Flor. [125]   Do you generally dream, full-dressed, Captain?
They all laugh. O'Don. Ha! ha! ha! (Tries to laugh, but stops suddenly, and sighs) I wish I could laugh, for, 'tis mighty comforting and wholesome; but, upon my soul, I can't.—I tell you, I saw him marched to prison.
Flor. To prison!
O'Don. He's condemned.
Clotilde runs off. Flor. Condemned!
O'Don. The King ordered him to his tent, to shower on him rewards and honors—his big heart could not bear it—he confessed all—asked reward for you, (to Frederic) and punishment on himself— and his sentence is—
Clotilde rushes in with a paper. Clo. 'Tis true, he's fled!
Fred. “A last farewell!— I hasten back to meet my doom—do not grieve, but pity—pardon me.”—Courage, Clotilde, there may still be time to save.
Gen. We'll to the prison.
Fred. We to the King—trust to Henri's clemency —Nay, droop not, Florence;—let love and hope support us.
                                         [Exeunt General with O'Donnel: Frederic with Florence and Clotilde.
[Page 75]
SCENE III. THE PRISON.—SAME AS SCENE I. Enter Moustache, from the interior. He stops and looks at Eugene's cell. Mou. So, the door of the cell closed—then Eugene is returned. [proceeds to unlock the gate.)
He returns with an Officer. Offi. Good morning, jailer.
Mou. Good morning.
Offi. I bring news, my old soldier, that will delight you.
Mou. Delight me? then I'm sure I shall be very much obliged to you for it.
Offi. The king has escaped assassination.
Mou. Heaven be praised!
Offi. He and the Duke were last night attacked in the forest of St. Germain, but were rescued by the bravery of—
Mou. Of whom?
Offi. That's at present unknown—the darkness separated them from their deliverer; but the king is safe, and will sup to-night in the Louvre.
Mou. Has Paris, then, opened her gates?
Offi. Yes, and all hearts are in extacies.

[Page 76]
Mou. All but mine, and— (apart, looking at Eugene's cell.)
Offi. But you don't seem glad!
Mou. I were a monster of ingratitude, did I not take my full share in the general joy;—but I did not sleep very well last night.
Offi. [25]   I guess the reason—new to your office— you were over anxious about your prisoner.
Mou. Yes, I believe that was it.
The muffled drum beats without.—Moustache starts. Offi. The guard is arrived—you hear the muffled drum.
Mou. (without) I do.
Offi. Is the prisoner ready?
Mou. Not quite—he has not yet left his cell.
Offi. 'Tis time.
Mou. I'll prepare him—do your duty without— leave me to do mine within.                                          [Exit Officer. All is still—he sleeps—were he awake he might hear my old heart thump—perhaps he dreams of happy days to come—and must I awake him, only that he may sleep in death? Yes, yes, I must—the time is short enough to prepare for so long a journey. [knocks at the door of the cell.] How profoundly he sleeps! [knocks again.] No answer— Eugene! [alarmed.] My friend! [a pause, then loud] Eugene! [dashes the door open, and rushes into the cell: exclaims from the inside,] 'Tis empty! [advances.] So! Eugene has deceived me
[Page 77]
—Eugene has sacrificed his friend! I shall choak— and if I do, the sooner I'm out of this vile, rascally world, the better. The consequences I can guess at [50]   —My life forfeited—my humble name insulted— my ingratitude to my king recorded—that's hard to bear—very hard! Here come the guard to demand their prisoner.
Enter Officer and a file of Soldiers. Offi. Deliver up the person of Eugene de Biron —here's your warrant.
Mou. (without) I can't obey it.
Offi. Cannot?
Mou. The prisoner is not here.
Offi. What, escaped?
Mou. No—I let him go.
Offi. And have you betrayed—?
Mou. No comments—'tis done.
Offi. Know you the consequences?
Mou. I suppose I soon shall.
Offi. I arrest you my prisoner—Soldiers, see you guard him safely—the council is sitting—I'll soon return.
                                         [Exit. Mou. I don't doubt it. What's that? Oh, the soldiers are loading—a pleasant sort of sound enough!—Do I then fear death? No, not in the heat of battle, with my good faulchion, giving blow for blow—but to die unarmed—with a white nightcap
[Page 78]
on, and in a cold morning, gives somehow an aguish kind of feel. But, 'tis the sting of ingratitude, [75]   that strikes deepest into my old heart.
Enter Officer. Offi. You must take the prisoner's place.
Mou. I thought so. [Officer orders the soldiers to advance, leaving a space between their ranks for Moustache.]
Offi. You will appear before the council, where I would advise you to confess your crime!
Mou. Confess my crime! I've committed none. I confided in the faith of a friend—I assisted the unhappy—what's to become of man, if that's criminal?
Offi. But, as you repent—
Mou. But I don't repent—
Offi. Come, then, there's your place.
Mou. Do you think I don't know it? Teach an old soldier his duty—Why, I'll march with as firm a step as the best of you.
Offi. Have you no fear?
Mou. Yes, fellow-soldier, I fear heaven, and that rids me of every other fear. [takes off from his girdle his keys—he throws them down.] Good bye, I wish you a wiser master—a jailor' heart should be like you—iron.
Offi. We wait.

[Page 79]
Mou. I'm coming—Eugene!
                                         (Eugene, whose hand is enveloped in a scarf, rushes from the interior of the prison, and places himself between the files of the guards.) Eug. Is here—forward.
Mou. (without) Ah! I'm so happy! (recovering from the instinctive feeling of safety.) I'm so miserable!
Eug. [100]   Grant me a moment. (goes to Moustache.) Oh, my friend, what anguish have I not caused you! hear my excuse. (to the officer.) Sir, I will be brief—returning through the forest, after having secured the felicity of my friend and sister, I heard a cry, and the strife of weapons—I forgot my promise—forgot my friend—forgot all but the calls of humanity. After some time dashing through the wood, I found numbers oppressing the few—unarmed as I was I joined the feeble party, and after a long and anxious struggle, succeeded, at the cost of this wound, of gaining a weapon, and driving the assailants from the field.
Mou. (without) Who was it you preserved?
Eug. I know not; for at that moment the peril of my friend rushed upon my memory,—I snatched this scarf to staunch my wound, that bled too freely, lest faintness should o'ertake me, e'er I could reach you.
                                         [During the latter part of this speech, Moustache's eye is rivetted on the scarf.
[Page 80]
Mou. (without) Assailed in the forest! that scarf! 'tis the King's—I swear he wore it yesterday in his tent. (to the Soldiers.) Move not a step, on your lives!
Offi. Take your station:—I must obey orders.
Mou. [125]   Must you? (snatching up the keys) Then I'll take the liberty of locking you all in.
Runs out.—The iron-gate is heard to close. Eug. Though this world is fading from my view, still one lovely vision flits before me—the form of the fair Florence:—A little token of remembrance I will send her. (opens a small pocket-book, writes a line, and encloses it.) Is there any French soldier who will fulfil the last request of his dying comrade? The soldiers all advance, and stretch out their hands to receive it. Thanks, good fellows—Alas! I'm faint—and I could wish to meet my doom, without blenching.
Offi. 'Tis a fearful hour, and asks a courage—
Eug. Fear me not—The pangs of death are passed.—So, with a sigh for my love, a prayer for my country, and a blessing for my king, I'll meet my fate with a smile.
(Shouts without.) Enter Moustache, with a Paper. Mou. Suspend the execution—these are your orders. (giving paper to the Officer.)

[Page 81]
Offi. What mean those shouts?
Mou. The King is passing towards Paris, where we must follow him.
Eug. Explain.
Mou. Hush! don't agitate yourself—March! [to the officer.] That's your place, (drily) you see, I know mine. Ask no questions, but rest on me, [150]   Eugene. Nay, don't spare me—there, there—
                                         [Exeunt Moustache supporting Eugene. SCENE IV. A VIEW OF THE COLONNADE OF THE OLD LOUVRE.                                          Enter Jocrisse with Louison under his arm, a Stick in his hand—he and Louison wearing sabots. They are followed by Gervais and Pinceau. Joc. Look, my dear Louison, this is the Louvre!
Lou. What a pretty place to live in!
Joc. Yes, it will suit me extremely well.
Guard. Out of the way! how dare you intrude here?
Joc. How dare we? Come, that's very well: I'll have that fellow shot.
Lou. He don't know us—he takes us for ordinary people.

[Page 82]
Joc. Is that possible? For ordinary people! well, we must impute it to his ignorance: we pardon you honest man.
Guard. Pardon me, quotha? retire, I say! [presenting his carbine.]
Joc. Retire! [takes the hand of Louison, and presents the ring of Henri in the face of the guard.] Boo!
Guard. The royal signet! Fair dame, where would you wish to place yourself to see the procession?
Lou. Oh! I'm not particular—the best place will do!
Joc. But we must take off our wooden shoes, before we enter the palace. I'll put them in this corner, snug.— (Places them.) Guard! have an eye to that property.
Distant Music. Ger. Here comes the good Henri.
Joc. [25]   Yes, here comes our old crony, the King— how graciously he bows!—
Lou. And smiles, and kisses his hand to the dames of the Court. He looks so grand. and so handsome—
Ger. And more like me than ever.
Pin. I shall take a sketch of the scene.
                                         [A Procession of the Triumphal Entry of Henri into Paris—at the conclusion, the Mayor kneels presenting the Keys of the City on a Cushion— Henri takes and returns them.
[Page 83]
Henri. Sully, thy hand:—This day's triumph is thy work. (Sully presses the King's hand.) Dost thou weep, old man? by my soul's hope, these tears are more precious to my heart than the sacred oil that anoints me king—
Sully. I have now lived long enough—lived to see Henri seated on the proud throne of his ancestors. —My ministry accomplished, I may retire.
Henri. Never!—'tis death alone must part us. In adversity you taught me resignation—you must now achieve a task more difficult—teach your king meekly to bear prosperity.
Guards. Stand back there! (to the crowd.)
Henri. No! open your ranks, and let my people pass. (the people rush in and surround him) they long to be near their father—see how my children cluster round me. Who says kings have not friends? —look here—a good king will always have millions. [looking round him] That's Jocrisse's face—I should [50]   know it among a thousand. (Jocrisse and his party advance) Welcome, my knot of king-makers. (taking Louison's hand.)
Joc. Know my face among a thousand! I knew it was comely—but I had no idea it would make my fortune.
Henri. This may, perhaps, assist. Enter Moustache. Well, Moustache, where's your prisoner?
[Page 84]
(Moustache points off the Stage) Does he know it was the Duke's life and mine he preserved?
Mou. Not yet.
Henri. 'Tis well! bring him before me.
Sully. (to Moustache) So, you allow your prisoner to take the evening air?
Mou. I do; but, pray, remember, if I had not allowed my prisoner the evening air, Duke Sully would not have had the trouble of finding fault with me this morning.
Henri. Go— (to Moustache, in an under tone) — You have silenced the Minister.
                                         [Exit Moustache. Enter General D'Aumont, Frederic, Clotilde, and Florence. Gen. My honoured king!
Henri. D'Aumont! my brave veteran, welcome to my heart.—St. Leon! I owe you a heavy debt of gratitude—so heavy, that my latest hour will be too [75]   short a time to pay it in.
Gen. Sire! these trembling petitioners. (presenting Clotilde and Florence.)
Henri. How lovely, even in tears!—Fear nothing —all will go well.
Mou. (without) Room there for the prisoner!

[Page 85]
Enter Moustache and Eugene. Gen., Fred,. Clo., Flor. (kneeling) Mercy, Gracious Henri!
Henri. All down but you!
Eug. Fear must not bend a soldier's knee.
Henri. Then I must try what gratitude can do;— but, first, render me my scarf.
Eug. Yours! Was it my king that I defended?
Henri. Yes, Eugene! taking out a miniature and chain) Will you now refuse my picture? Eugene drops on his knee. Henri puts the picture round his neck. St. Leon! Orders him, by signs, to kneel by Eugene, draws his swords, and knights them. Rise, Chevaliers—Rise, my own true Knights.
Flor. Then, he is free!
Henri. No—I only change his bondage.—Fair Florence, he is your prisoner—use him kindly—but don't let him run about at nights, as Moustache did. Brave Crillon, at length our toils are past.
Cril. But this new attempt upon your sacred life—
Henri. Ah, my friend, they'll reach my heart at last!—Well, let them wait 'till this heart has expended
[Page 86]
all its love for my people, and your king will fall contented, honored, and adored—but, while I [100]   live, the shepherd's pipe shall wake our echoes with its merry call, and under the shadow of his vine, the humble cottager shall, in cheerfulness and contentment, bless the peaceful reign of Henri Quatre .

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A hall belonging to Sir Mark Chase—a chamber door in the back scene, another in the side scene; An entrance far back, through which is seen a wall, and a house beyond for lunatics. Enter Mr. and Mrs. Selborne, with a Post-boy. Mr. Sel. The horses are paid for; there's for yourselves — (giving money) .
Post-boy. (dissatisfied) Your honour, we gallopped all the way.
Mr. Sel. True; and had you trotted , I would have given you double —Go!                                          [Exit Post-boy. As I expected—nobody to receive us. The old, faithful domestics are, no doubt, gathered round my poor uncle's death-bed. If the fatal moment has not passed , I must find some one to announce me. (Rings the bell) . Nobody to answer.
Mrs. Sel. I hear a carriage stop.
Mr. Sel. The mourning equipage, may be!

[Page 2]
Mrs. Sel. No; happily it is the carriage of our kind friend, Maria Darlington —true to her appointment!
                                         (Selborne runs out, and returns with Maria). Mrs. Sel. A thousand grateful thanks!
Maria. My time to a second! Me voici! (shewing her watch to Mrs. Selborne). My dear Frances! (salutes her). How provokingly handsome you look: Nay, don't blush, or there'll be no bearing you! But now, my sweet friends, having accomplished my journey, I hope you'll not think me very unreasonable, if [25]   I ask— why I have made it?
Mrs. Sel. Indeed, Maria, it will require all your good nature to pardon the liberty my husband—
Maria. Pardon, nonsense!—Come, Mr. Œdipus, solve your riddle.
Mr. Sel. Thus then—my worthy uncle here is dead, or dying.
Maria. Poor Sir Mark, I'm very sorry; I flatter myself I was a great favourite of his.
Mr. Sel. He wrote me this letter, which, (producing a letter) . Oh! here's Old Fixture, his favourite Yorkshire servant.                                          (Fixture sings without, “Old King Cole,” &c. What, singing! unfeeling scoundrel! That fellow has fattened on my uncle's bounty these thirty years; and to sing at such a moment is unfeeling indeed.
Enter Fixture, singing. Fix. Selborne). Ah! my young Master, I be mortal glad to see you—you look deadly well.
Mr. Sel. Mortal , and deadly! apt words I own , and fitted to the scene. Well, Fixture , my poor uncle—what! he's gone?
Fix. Yes —I wish he had not ; he'll find it very cold.
Mr. Sel. Cold! (apart). True, the grave is cold!
Fix. But he said he should be soon in a fine glow .
Mr. Sel. [50]   Soon be in a fine glow!
Fix. I suppose you can guess where he is gone?
Mr. Sel. Where we all hope to go.
Fix. Yes—he's gone a shooting!

[Page 3]
Mr. Sel. Shooting! why, he wrote me word he was dying.
Fix. Dying! he! he! Why Lord, Sir, he has been dying any day these thirty years,—he! he!
Mr. Sel. Indeed! he! he! I'm rejoiced (walks) .
Fix. Yes, I see. (two guns are fired.) Bang! bang! That's he!—a brace—down, for a guinea!
Mr. Sel. Why, look here— (showing a letter) . He sent for me to close his eyes in death! (emphasizing each word.)
Fix. I don't know about closing his eyes in death ; but I know he seldom closes one without it. (aiming) .
Mr. Sel. 'Tis absolute insanity! (striking the letter with his hand). I say —the next house to this, surrounded by a high wall—(the fellow's drove us there by mistake) 'tis an establishment for folks deranged here— (hitting his forehead) . Is not it?
Fix. Oh, yes!
Mr. Sel. Depend on't, 'tis catching; my uncle's got a touch—I'll be damn'd but its catching!— (walks about, gesticulating).
Fix. Why, I don't know but it is—                                          (A dog-whistle is blown in a long continued note). [75]   That's Master—that's for me! what a shortness of breath he has got! he! he! dying, quotha! he! he!— Coming, sir.
Mrs. Fixture. (without) Why, Fixture! husband! husband, I say.
Fix. That's my wife's whistle; how shrill and tuneful! Master must wait, when Mistress wants me.— Coming, dearee.
                                         [Exit. Mr. Sel. Here's a pretty affair! But, don't do me the injustice to suppose I'm sorry to hear of my uncle's health. By my soul, I wish the worthy old fellow every blessing! But I've got into such a scrape— such a dilemma—so, so, so, so— (walks about) .
Maria. Don't stammer, and strut about so—but explain.
Mr. Sel. I'll endeavour. You know, Maria, my uncle always wished that you and I should be united, and you know, I—

[Page 4]
Maria. Did not wish it.
Mr. Sel. Oh, fie! you shock me—no—no I was conscious—I—I—did not merit so much—ha—ha— happiness—yes, so much happiness; and my dear Frances not thinking me unworthy her affection, we were—
Maria. Privately married—ye cruel wretches!— [100]   ha! ha! ha!
Mr. Sel. Don't laugh—'tis really no laughing matter—
Maria. Being married, you know best.
Mr. Sel. Three days ago I received this letter from my uncle; now only read it.
Maria. “Dear Nephew, I find I am approaching my last moments”—
Mr. Sel. Last moments!—That's the gentleman that's shooting—pray go on!—
Maria. “I shall leave you my whole fortune, provided you present to me Maria Darlington as your bride.” Meaning me! my best curtsey is due for that— (curtseys) . “Rely on it, George, look England thro', you'll not find so perfect”— (tickled with the supposed compliment) —Oh! dear!—“so beautiful”— Oh! I really can't go on. (Giving the letter to Selborne.)
Mr. Sel. “Not find so perfect, so beautiful a manor for Partridges, as she is heiress to”—
Maria. Partridge! an old wretch—I'll plague his heart out for this.
Mr. Sel. “If you don't marry her, your legacy, namely, ‘a nice new shilling ,’ now lies before me; the lawyer is in the house, and your answer to this will be his instructions for the last [125]   testament of your dying uncle, Mark Chace .— P. S. If I am dead when you arrive, don't be uncomfortable —you'll find well-aired linen—Venison that has hung a fortnight—fresh Trout —the last new Novel, and Hock quite alive—tho' a year older than your departed uncle.” Was there ever such an extraordinary letter? Need I say how unhappy it has made me?
Maria. And need I say how hungry it has made me? Well, and what was your answer?

[Page 5]
Mr. Sel. Oh! I replied that I married you yesterday.
Maria. Married me! Partridges , and all!
Mr. Sel. And, that, according to his orders, we should be here to-day, and here we are!
Maria. Yes—and here we are! (imitating). Well, my dear Hubby, what's next? (Taking his arm, and hugging it).
Mr. Sel. I'm sure, Maria, you would have consented to our supposed marriage for a day or two; but, as my uncle is well, the situation will be intolerable!
Mrs. Sel. Oh, quite intolerable!
Maria. Ahem!
Mr. Sel. To you —of course I mean—intolerable to you .
Maria. Of course—ha! ha!—Well—and what's to be done?
Mr. Sel. [150]   Run away as fast as we can.
Maria. Run away! I'm glad I an't your wife.
Sir Mark, (without). My Nephew and his Bride arrived—Set the bells ringing—pile up the bonfires —tap the October!
Maria. Besides, 'tis too late; you hear we have been announced.
Mrs. S. Let us fall at his feet, and implore pardon.
Maria. What, finish the farce in the first scene— that would, I think, be a pity! Let me consider our characters—you are my husband.
Mr. Sel. Yes. (sighing).
Maria. Civil, and natural— I'm the happy bride; and pray, Miss, who are you?
Mrs. Sel. Who am I?
Maria. Yes, who are you? Be so good as to give an account of yourself.
Mrs. Sel. Oh! I'm your bridemaid, madam.
Maria. Very well—now mind: your trait is to do all in your power to please the old gentleman— I to torment him. I'll make myself so disagreeable
Mr. Sel. That you'll find very difficult.
Maria. There you are complimenting —you forget I'm your wife —stick to your character, if you please
[Page 6]
[175]   — your efforts and mine (to Mrs. S.) will soon make Sir Mark wish you had been his nephew's wife—when he does so , then fall at his feet and own it—Hush! he's here!
Enter Sir Mark. Sir Mark. Where are they?—my darlings—my children—my heirs—Oh! George, right welcome to the manor of Warrender! I hope I shall shew you some sport (Laying his gun down.)
Maria. We hope to return the compliment. (aside.)
Sir Mark. Let me kiss your bride!                                          (Selborne forgetting himself, presents Mrs. Selborne.) Heyday! this—
Mr. Sel. No, sir—this—this is Miss Tiverton, sir—the bridemaid, sir—My bride you are already acquainted with—this lady being a stranger, sir.
Sir Mark. No longer so. Miss Tiverton, I know your father well. Joy! joy, my Maria! (hugs her.) Aye, now all my wishes are accomplished —and I have now only to pull off my shooting gaiters, and lie me down and die.
Mr. Sel. Your letter alarmed me exceedingly— But you are not—
Sir Mark. Quite dead—no, George, not quite.
Mr. Sel. And how is your health, sir?
Sir Mark. Bad, very bad—the least thing fatigues [200]   me.
Mrs. Sel. Pray be seated, sir.
Sir Mark. Thank you, my pretty love. (chucking her under the chin.) I seldom sit down but at meals.
Mr. Sel. How far may you have walked to-day?
Sir Mark. About eighteen miles, not a yard more!
Maria. Indeed! and the fatigue has made you faint.
Sir Mark. No, I feel faint from hunger , my dear.
Mr. Sel. Your appetite, then, is pretty good?

[Page 7]
Sir Mark. Yes; I eat well, and I drink well, and I sleep well—but that's all.
All. Poor man!
Sir Mark. But let's be merry while we may— Egad! we'll have a day on't. Let's dress for dinner; there, George—there's the room I've prepared for you and your wife—this, Miss Tiverton, shall be yours— get you in—get you in!
Maria. I wish to be with my friend.
Mrs. Sel. Yes, sir, she wishes to be with me.
Sir Mark. Nonsense! Eh, George, you know better than that—there, go along with you, and help your wife to dress—What are you shilly-shallying about? [225]   —Why don't you go?
Maria. We're going, sir,—yes, sir, we're going.
Sir Mark. Well, then, go, sir—for I've a thousand things to do.                                          (He pushes Selborne and Miss Darlington into the room at the back, Mrs. Selborne exit into hers.) (Faintly.) Oh, dear! Oh, dear! How the least thing shakes my poor weak frame, my pulse is low, and I feel ready to faint—I must try to support exhausted nature as well as I can. (In the voice of Stentor.) Fixture! put the venison pasty on the side-table, and a tankard of ale—I can touch nothing else before dinner.
                                         (Exit.                                          (Selborne leaves the room he entered on tip-toe, and goes to his wife's apartment, taps at the door, and listens.) Re-enter Sir Mark. Sir Mark. I forgot my gun—Eh! what's George about? (steps aside.)
Sel. Fanny! Fanny!
Sir Mark. Oh! Oh! I suspect poaching here. (apart.)
Mrs. Sel. Who's there?
Sel. 'Tis I?
Enter Mrs. Selborne. Mrs. Sel. My dear George!

[Page 8]
Sel. My sweet Fanny—I may not have another opportunity of telling you, that I shall contrive to deceive the old boy, and in the evening come secretly to your apartment.
Mrs. Sel. But I don't like your being with your wife there, I assure you.
Sel. My soul! can you doubt 'tis you alone I [250]   adore? Let this embrace—
Sir Mark. Ahem! (advances.)
Sel. My uncle! undone!
Sir Mark. Oh! you profligate! Oh! you—what only two days married? Oh! you Don Juan! I'll expose you to your injured wife. Maria!—Mrs. Selborne! (calls at the door.)
Enter Maria. Maria. What's the matter?
Sir Mark. The matter is—I caught your bridegroom in your bridemaid's arms, planning an assignation —and sorry I am to shock you, my dear, with such heart-breaking intelligence.
Maria. Oh, fie, George! I'm ashamed of you— you naughty man—you naughty man! (playfully slapping his hands, which he returns.)
Sir Mark. “You naughty man!” The world's at an end!—Oh! this is my precious match.
Mrs. Sel. What an indelicate situation I am placed in. (hides her face.)
Sir Mark. Ah! Miss Tiverton, you have some modesty, and I hope, my dear child, my interference has been opportune enough to save you from the arts of a libertine—from the seductions of that “naughty man.” (imitating.) Don't weep, he shan't annoy you again—we'll dine by ourselves , and hob and nob together. (taking her arm.)
Sel. [275]   Hob and nob! sir, I—
Sir Mark. Keep off, sir! (to Mrs. Sel.) and tomorrow morning, my love, I'll take you home to your friends.—Fixture!
Sel. Then I shall lose my wife. (aside to Maria.)
Maria Be quiet!

[Page 9]
Enter Fixture. Sir Mark. Run to the Talbot, and order post-horses to be here at day-light, and furbish up the old coach.
Fix. Sir, the turkey hen is hatching a brood of chicks in it.
Sir Mark. Out with her!
                                         [Exit Fixture. Come, we'll take a walk in the garden, and you shall never see him again—there now!                                          (Selborne can hardly be restrained by Maria.) And to-night you shall sleep in a room where nobody can come to you, but old Deborah, the housekeeper— there now!
                                         (Exeunt Sir Mark, and Mrs. Selborne, he patting and kissing her hand.) Sel. Sleep where nobody can come to her but old Deborah—Curse old Deborah! and, to-morrow, he takes her to her offended family, and I shall see her no more. I'll go and own my marriage.
Maria. And triumphantly march off with your new shilling! No, that will never do. Have not we all the day to counterplot? (going to the window.) Ha! ha! how lovingly they walk together! [300]   George, come here—Quick! quick! whose equipage is that passing the gates—there—see!
Sel. Oh! I know—'tis—'tis—pshaw! Oh! the Hon. Mr. Highflyer.
Maria. I thought so—then this is no place for me —I suppose he's coming here—therefore I go—
Sel. Coming here! no such thing! neither my uncle nor I are acquainted with him. His place is near Newmarket, far away from—
Maria. Newmarket—Yes, yes, I know. (peevishly.)
Sel. Have you had a little quarrel lately?
Maria. Lately! sir, I fortunately have not seen that gentleman for eleven months and seventeen days, for I have counted them. I own I was at first a little uneasy at our breaking off, but time has, as you see,
[Page 10]
entirely removed both regret and resentment—Obstinate wretch!
Sel. Oh! I see it has.
Maria. I now make it a rule never to talk about him—never.—Could you believe this of him, Mr. Selborne? —I had perfected myself à merveille in a piece of music of his recommendation—had the concert fixed—sent him a card—instead of his presence, I was honoured with a letter from Newmarket—shocked — en desespoir , and a parcel of trash, that he could [325]   not be present—but that business must be minded—I returned his letter in a blank cover—he wrote another, I returned it—another, I returned that—and would you think it possible—he wrote no more.
Sel. Tho' you had only sent back three letters.
Maria. Only three!
Sel. And you have not sought a reconciliation?
Maria. Reconciliation, sir!—Rivers may climb mountains—doves become the nestlings of kites— man become faithful—any monstrous thing is more probable than that I should be reconciled to Alfred!
Sel. I wish I had an opportunity to try that—I see she loves him.
Enter Fixture, with a card in one hand, and a guinea in the other. Fix. Very much of a gentleman indeed.—Sir, would you believe it—I've been at the public house, and—
Sel. I can very easily believe it.
Fix. There's a great stranger come—a mortal sensible man.
Sel. How do you know that?
Fix. He gave me a guinea—Says he—“I wish to examine the inside of the interior of that wise insane establishment”—next door, you know, sir; master's a governor, thinks I—so, I'll get a ticket for him — and mayhap, another guinea for myself (reading the card.) [350]   The Hon. Alfred Highflyer— (walking slowly out, and looking alternately at card and guinea.)
Maria. “Of Racket Hall”—'tis my detestable lover—who is—
Fix. Very much of a gentleman indeed!
                                         [Exit.
[Page 11]
Maria. I won't stay!
Sel. He's not coming here—so, why agitate yourself?
Maria. Agitate myself! ridiculous! To prove I'm not concerned about him, I shall go and amuse myself at the window.
                                         [Exit. Sel. For the chance of seeing him—They shall meet, that's fixed—Eh! I have it—Fixture, come back—I want you—Come back, I say!
                                         (Maria appears at the door.) Maria. Come back! what can Selborne want with him—thank heaven, I've no curiosity—only one may as well listen.
Sel. Ha! ha! 'tis a bold thought, but I owe Maria a good turn, so here goes! [Enter Fixture.] Come hither! I'll tell you, my old boy, how you may make that one guinea five . (Taking out his purse.)
Fix. By coining—?
Sel. Only a little falsehood , my old friend.—You must assist my plans, and share my confidence.— Know, then, I am married to Miss Tiverton; but, fearing Sir Mark's disinheriting threats, have deceived him by a pretended alliance with his favourite, Miss [375]   Darlington.— That Mr. Highflyer is her lover (pointing to the card.) They have quarrelled, and I wish to bring about a meeting; therefore, instead of taking him to the next house, you shall introduce him to this , as the Lunatic Asylum, and to me , as the managing director!
Fix. This house as the lunatic—He! he! Oh, you're joking!
Sel. If you think so, I'll put my purse in my pocket.
Fix. No, don't—there would be no joke in that.
Sel. The governor's compliments to Mr. Highflyer —shall be happy in receiving the honour of his visit— you hear?
Fix. Tolerably.
Sel. You understand?
Fix. Perfectly!—I'm to say, this is a Lunacy House —Ecod! it is not very unlike one.
Sel. Mind you repeat—
Fix. Never fear—I'll repeat all the lies you've told me, you may depend on't—Ha! ha!—The Governor's compliments
                                         [Exit, repeating his lesson, behind.
[Page 12]
Maria. Upon my word, a very pretty scheme! and I am, I suppose, to be out of my senses —I must be so to join in it!
Enter Sir Mark, and Mrs. Selborne, from behind. Sel. Nay, but Maria—now hear me—ought you to [400]   be angry—here am I taking pains to bring a lover to your feet, and you are not satisfied.
Sir Mark. How unreasonable!—Well said, husband!
Maria. You are very kind, sir—but I am vain enough to think I can provide lovers for myself.
Sir Mark. I dare say you can!—Well said, wife! (advancing.) What will this world come to?
Sel. What the devil shall I do now?
Maria. Do! —why, run away with your wife, to be sure!
                                         [Exit, taking his arm. Mrs. S. Oh, George! run away with your wife.—
                                         (Going to follow them. Sir Mark. No, no, Miss Tiverton, you shall have nothing to say to the profligate! —go into that room 'till I find my old housekeeper! (Puts her into room.) They are all out of their senses! —To be sure, this union I promised to Maria Darlington's departed father, poor Charles, when we were younkers!—Ha! ha!—well, well! youth and age have both their tantarums!
SONG. Sir Mark .
[I.]
Love in season,
Like sneezing,
Is pleasing,
Not teazing;
It prickles,
And tickles,
[425]      With fanciful joys,
While toying,
Enjoying,
She sighs out,
And cries out—
“You devil,
Be civil,
   And don't make a noise!”
[Page 13]

Then pressing,
Caressing,
And ranting,
And chanting,
They rhyme away,
Time away,
   In a love song;
Then dance it,
And prance it,
And thump it,
And stump it,
And bump it,
And rump it,
   All the night long!
      Love in season, &c.
II.
Youth over,
In clover
[450]   We muzzle,
And guzzle,
And toast it,
And roast it,
   Like jolly old boys!
Break glasses,
Kiss lasses,
And pick up,
And hiccup;
And swaggering,
Staggering,
   Finish our joys!
Then phthisic,
And physic,
Blue devils
Us levels,
'Till doctor
And proctor
   Bespeak us a grave;
Then weepers,
And peepers,
And moaners,
And groaners,
And gay men
Cry “Amen!”
[475]      And chaunt out a stave!
      Youth over, &c.                                          [Exit.

SCENE II. A pleasure ground: an angle of the scene displaying a handsome aviary, with a macaw and other birds— the aviary fronted with brass wire-work, and partially concealed by flowering shrubs—the rest of the scene arranged in a tasteful display of wood, water, and the agrèmens that form a handsome domain. Enter Maria and Selborne. Maria. And do you think I will ever be reconciled to Alfred?
Sel. Certainly I do. (aside) —Certainly I do not!— If I thought so I would prevent your meeting—my object is to punish him, and bring him to your feet.
Maria. Yes, I own I should like to see him at my feet.
Sel. And then to consign him to utter despair.
Maria. Yes, to utter despair—Well then, I consent to see him.
Sel. Throw your hair into a little disorder—and that, with a veil, will do very well for a desponding witless maiden—and when I clap my hands three times thus, (clapping his hands) then begin a Mad Bess kind of air—he's coming!
Maria. I would rather not see him.
Sel. I know that; but go, and mind the signal.
Maria. I think I ought to be sure 'tis he.
Sel. There can be no doubt of it—there are not two such.
Maria. No—that there are not.
Sel. [25]   Then don't let curiosity mar our plan.
Maria. I've no curiosity, I assure you.
                                         [Exit, raising herself and looking for Alfred. Sel. Poor Maria! how she detests him, ha! ha!— He's here—now for my assumed character of director. (Retires up the stage.)

[Page 15]
Enter Fixture, introducing Alfred. Fix. This way, sir, I can shew you all the grounds.
Alf. A noble mansion—strong and capacious—and the grounds handsome and varied. I understand they practice here the soothing system with their unhappy patients—which is certainly the most humane, if not the most sanative plan.
Fix. My Master, sir.
Alf. Oh! rather young!
Sel. Keep my uncle out of the way. (aloud) You need not wait, (to Alf. ) —A careful steady servant, sir, and seldom forgets any thing.
Fix. The five guineas for instance, (aside to Sel.)
Sel. There, confound you! (Gives purse to Fixture.) The object of your visit reflects the highest honour on your humanity and patriotism.
Alf. Yes, sir, disgusted with the insane creation, that take the privilege of roaming about this world, I wish to devote my time and wealth to those unfortunates, who are under salutary controul.
Sel. I regret I cannot, consistently with the rules of this establishment admit you at this hour into the interior.
Alf. [50]   I beg you will not infract any regulation on my account.
Sel. Many of the patients enjoy the salubrity of the garden, and, perhaps, the grounds may afford you some amusement. Favour me with your company.
                                         [Exeunt Selborne and Alfred. Enter Mrs. Fixture. Fix. I must keep the secret safe from my wife. She has a ravenous curiosity, and particularly about young men.
Mrs. F. I a curiosity about young men! If I had, I should not have been content with such a curiosity of an old one.—No, sir, I defy your words—so, tell me directly who the young man is, that you so falsely say I've a curiosity about?
Fix. Well, I will—he's a Mr. Highflyer, a dasher on the turf.

[Page 16]
Mrs. F. Keeps race-horses? Oh! how I do love Taunton races.
Fix. Oh, those cursed Taunton races! you never cleared up your privately going—
Mrs. F. Don't trouble your head about it, my dear.
Fix.. But, my dear, it does trouble my head,—I never think of it, but I feel much shooting pains—
Mrs. F. Who are those? I'm sure, that's the young dasher, in green.
Fix. As she deceived me about Taunton races, I'll [75]   deceive her—No, he in green is Sir Mark's nephew, Mr. Selborne, a sensible, discreet married man, like me. Come away, I say,—look! here's a pretty present (shewing a purse) and I'll tell you a great secret —so, come away.
                                         [Exeunt Mr. and Mrs. Fixture. Re-enter Selborne and Alfred. Sel. So, sir, you have quarrelled with the world— you are a young misanthrope.
Alf. Yes, sir; as Hamlet says, man delights not me—nor woman neither—Woman! Oh! (spitefully) sir, I don't mean to annoy you with the lacerations of my wounded spirit, but—woman! Oh! (recovering) I really ask your pardon.—Pray, sir, what do you consider the most effective agent in soothing the irritation of the mind.
Sel. Music;—but, perhaps, you are not an admirer?
Alf. Sir, to music I owe all my happiness, all my misery. I love it to distraction.
Sel. Distraction! Ah, sir! I have under my care an angel. Oh! such a voice! (clapping his hands.) Oh! such a voice! (clapping his hands-) Oh! such a voice! (clapping again.) (Maria sings the burthen of a Song.) That's she!
Alf. Her voice recalls—
Sel. Hush!

[Page 17]
SONG. Maria.
Hush thy vain sighs, fair maiden,
   Tears flow no more in vain,
[100]   Heart cease thy fond upbraiding,
   Lips no more breathe his name.
“He's gone! aye, gone for ever
   “Far, far away from me,
“Fond Maidens' then endeavour
   “To shun credulity!” Alf. That song I well remember—it caused my quarrel with Maria. (To Selborne.) And has reason fled that form, which breathes such enchanting melody?
Sel. Alas! 'tis even so—poor Maria!
Alf. Maria. did he say!—May I, sir, presume to ask the name of the lovely sufferer?
Sel. Maria Darlington.
Alf. Horror! let me conceal my agitation! Oh! where's my resentment now? Know you the cause of her malady?
Sel. Unrequited love.
Alf. I the cause! I the destroyer of the proudest spirit that heaven ever breathed into a human form!— Might I be permitted to speak— (Selborne shakes his head.) Only to look on her?
Sel. That may be permitted—you see that bubbling brook (points off) , its murmurs often invite her to wander near its margin—there we may look on her, and join our petitions for her recovery, and our curses on [125]   the wretch who could desolate such a paradise of sweets.
Alf. Yes, as you say, sir, curses on the wretch— (embarrassed) that—you are very good, sir—Come!
Sir Mark. Why, George! nephew!
Sel. Zounds! my uncle! what the devil shall I do now? he must not see me.
Alf. Who is that, sir?
Sel. An unhappy gentleman, resident here, you understand (pointing to the head,) harmless—perfectly harmless—fancies himself proprietor of this house and manor—you see he's in a shooting costume—and we
[Page 18]
indulge him with a little unloaded pop-gun—seem to fall into his fancies.—'tis our plan of treatment.
Alf. Rely on me. But that angel—
Sel. I'll lead her to you weeping willow.— (Sir Mark sings without.) —Zounds! he's here!— (Sir M. sings louder.) Don't be alarmed, he is quite harmless.
                                         [Exit. Alf. How unfit to humour the insanities of others, while I am scarcely on the verge of sanity myself.— Oh! Maria.
Enter Sir Mark, with his gun, calling to one of his dogs—Doll—Doll—Doll, very loud. Sir Mark. This precious nephew of mine has thrown me into such a fever, I can't stay in the house.—I must just brush the home covers to cool and tranquillize my poor nerves.—Eh! what strange gentleman [150]   have we here?— (Alfred nods.) Strange gentleman! no—he seems a very familiar one.—Your servant, Sir—Pray! sir, to what may I attribute the honour of your presence in my grounds?
Alf. My grounds! poor fellow! I must indulge him. Sir, the beautiful disposition of hill, dale, wood, and water, has tempted me to intrude.
St. Mark. Intrude! sir, you are welcome—your hand.—
Alf. My hand— (hesitates.) Oh! he's harmless. (Shaking hands.) Sir, the charms of the scenery joined, to your good manners.—
Sir Mark. Sir, I flatter myself my manors are as good as any gentleman's in the county; though last winter I had the misfortune to lose all my Hares.
Alf. Had his head shaved, poor fellow!
Sir Mark. So, sir, if you're fond of sport, this is the place.
Alf. The place for sport—melancholy idea!
Sir Mark. What do you think of this piece?
                                         (giving him his gun.) Alf. Very handsome!
Sir Mark. And generally fatal; should you like to take a shot this morning?
Alf. [175]   If you please, sir. I must humour him. (aside). Egad. I'll pretend to kill that Macaw.

[Page 19]
Sir Mark. I suppose you are pretty sure?
Alf. You shall see. (aside).                                          (Fires—the Macaw drops from the perch.) Zounds! 'tis loaded!
Sir Mark. Damn the fellow! he has killed my Macaw!
Alf. To trust a loaded gun in such hands, was madness.
Sir Mark. It was indeed: so give it me instantly.
Alf. It has another barrel; I shall be shot here!— I won't give it you.
Sir Mark. Not give me my gun? Why, you damn'd impudent scoundrel!
Alf. Be quiet—be quiet—you know you have keepers here.
Sir Mark. Keepers! to be sure I have.
Alf. Come, he's not so mad, but he knows he has keepers! Be composed, or I'll call them.
Sir Mark. You call my keepers—you!
Alf. Oh! I must, I see—here, keepers, do your duty.
                                         [Exit Sir Mark. He's gone off with my gun! Here, Bob! Thomas! Gregory! Fixture!—Stop that fellow with my gun.
Enter Selborne, Game-keepers, and Servants. Sel. [200]   My dear Sir Mark, what's the matter?
Sir Mark. That damn'd swaggering rascal has killed my Macaw, and marched off with my gun!
Sel. A stranger make such a disturbance! What could he aim at?
Sir Mark. Why, at my Macaw, I tell you!
Sel. Sir, I shall instantly demand of him an account of his conduct.
Sir Mark. Do, George.
Enter Fixture. Fix. Here's your Worship's gun. (apart to Selborne.) What a pretty commence! (aloud) —but, I can't find the gentleman.

[Page 20]
Sel. But I'll find him—at least, I hope so. (aside.)
Sir Mark. Do. But, George, where's your wife?
Sel. That's a good question!—Why, sir, did not you take her away from me? Did not—
Sir Mark. I take—why, zounds, you're thinking of Miss Tiverton again!
Sel. No, sir—yes, sir—no, sir—yes, sir—
Sir Mark. No, sir—yes, sir—you'll drive me mad, sir.
Sel. Sir!—
Sir Mark. I won't hear a word, sir—leave my presence, you profligate, or I'll—                                          [Exit Selborne. Was there ever such a Tarquin—a Blue-beard? And [225]   was ever poor gentleman brought to such an untimely grave? Ah! they'll soon have their will—now I have made mine. Bob! here, load my gun—and just to raise my spirits, let's have a jolly Song and Chorus, my old boy! (slapping Fixture on the back.) and then for the merry Spaniels!
SONG AND CHORUS.
When the Southern breezes play—
   The uplands let us gain,
Where ruddy health with smiles invites,
   To join her sporting train! CHORUS.
When the Southern, &c. SOLO.
Unleach the merry pack—
See—see—they scent the gale!
Their chuckling throats
Repeat the notes,
Our sport it will not fail!
When the sun his course has run,
We trim the evening fire,
   And gaily troll
   The cheering bowl
To the health of wife and 'squire!
[Page 21]

Then the song and joke prevail,
'Till the turret-bell strikes—One!
And the parting cup of ale
Proclaims our day is done!
[250]   When the southern, &c. CHORUS.
   When the southern, &c.

END OF THE FIRST ACT.

[Page 22]
ACT II. SCENE I. One half of the Stage is employed in displaying a deep-shaded grove—A marble urn is seen near the banks of a river—In the front is a weeping willow— The other half of the Stage shews the boundaries of a park, and an extensive country beyond it. Enter Alfred. Alf. There is the brook poor Maria augments with her tears—here, the willow she ruffles with her sighs —there dwell the echos that correspond to her plaintive minstrelsy—and this is thy work, thou unfeeling, but too bewitching man.—I really had no idea that my person and manners would have been so fatal.— In future, I shall mind what I'm about, and by an acrid severity, neutralize the horrid poison of this foolish tongue, and prevent further mischief to the soft, fond, believing sex. Enter Selborne, motioning to Maria. Well, Sir, where is she?
Sel. You may observe her in that grove.
Alf. I don't see—Yes, there I caught a glimpse— how my heart beats!
Sel. Sing to her, that will attract her.
Alf. Sing! sir, 'tis with shame and sorrow I own, that I can't sing.
Sel. Not sing! poor man, I pity you.

[Page 23]
Alf. Thank you, sir—I've done mischief enough, without singing.—Oh! if I could have sung—
Sel. See! she advances.
                                         (Maria walks down the grove, and seats herself under the willow.) Maria. Alfred!
Sel. That's the name she always pronounces.
Alf. I don't wonder at it! 'tis a very pretty name— [25]   Maria!
Sel. Hush!
Alf. He won't let me speak to her—I wish I could get rid of him.
Enter Fixture. Fix. Sir your uncle is asking—
                                         (To Selborne, who stops his mouth.) Alf. Fixture.) Get your master away, and there's another guinea.
Sel. How provoking, that my presence should be required elsewhere—I'm very sorry—
Alf. So am I, sir; but, business, you know, sir— (shouldering him.)
Fix. Yes, business, sir.
Sel. 'Tis unlucky!
Alf. Very true; but, in your situation, ceremony would be highly improper. (pushing him.)
Fix. Oh! very improper. (pulling him by the coat.)
                                         (Exeunt Selborne and Fixture.) Maria. Heigho!
Alf. She sighs, and parts the branches of the weeping willow, with her long interesting melancholy fingers.
Maria. Alfred!
Alf. Again, my name!
Maria. What proofs did I not give you of my love?—Did I not engross your time, exhaust your patience—did I not prefer tormenting you to any other of your sex?
Alf. [50]   Kind soul! she did!
Maria. And what was my return?—You smiled in my absence—went to sleep in my presence—preferred the Spring Meeting at the course of Newmarket, to meeting with me in the Theatre of the Haymarket.

[Page 24]
Alf. I was that wretch.
Maria. And while my heart fluttered with the hope that you were arranging our marriage with Mr. Buckle, the Proctor, you were settling a race with Mr. Buckle, the jockey—then I lost my senses.
Alf. And I, my match—I'll venture to speak to her— Maria!
Maria. Who calls Maria?
Alf. One who loves her. Have you forgotten Alfred?
Maria. Oh no; but he forsook me: yet even then, when rivals asked my hand, my heart—at the concert —in the waltz—mark how I answered them.
SONG. Maria .
[I.]
When harmony awakens each bosom to joy,
Gay, artful lovers those moments employ
      In dulcet notes sighing,
      In cadences dying,
Each whispers, “Ah! can you these raptures destroy?”
   I only reply—la, le, lal, &c. (dances)
II.
The maze of the waltz to the lover has charms,
[75]   It animates hope, it prudence disarms—
      Pursuing, then pressing,
      Encircling, caressing,
He sighs—“Ah! for ever repose in these arms—
   I only reply—la, le, lal, &c. (dances.)                                          (After the song, she sinks into dejection.) Alf. How she waltzes! What an invaluable wife I have lost! (addresses her.) But if Maria remembered Alfred, she would look kindly on him.
Maria. Does she now look angry?
Alf. She would offer Alfred her hand.
Maria. Does she now refuse it?
                                         (he takes her hand.) Alf. She would find an asylum in his arms.
                                         (she sinks into his arms.)
[Page 25]
Enter Sir Mark. Sir Mark. In a gallant's arms! Mercy on us! mercy on us! Aye, you may well hide your face.
                                         (Maria faintly shrieks, covers her face with her veil, and runs off.) Alf. Confound this vexatious, unfortunate!—and at such a moment. Yet what can I say to him. (In a pathetic tone) Why, unhappy old gentleman, will you intrude yourself?
Sir Mark. Why, impertinent young jackanapes, will you intrude yourself!
Alf. 'Sdeath! you have wounded my feelings.
Sir Mark. 'Sdeath, Sir, you have killed my macaw. Who the devil are you, and how dare you take freedoms with a married lady?
Alf. [100]   Married! Maria married! But I must not irritate him; I must pursue the soothing system. Hush! be quiet; you'll bring on the fever.
Sir Mark. The fever! shall I? Oh dear! I hope not.
Alf. How he looks—'tis quite afflicting to see such a desolation.
Sir Mark. Do I look ill?
Alf. I pronounce him incurable.
Sir Mark. Incurable! I hope not. Don't shake your head—they tell me here I am getting better.
Alf. Aye, I dare say they do.
Sir Mark. I've had a consultation of London doctors.
Alf. No doubt, no doubt.
Sir Mark. You see they give me hopes—look, pray look! (gives the letter to Alfred, and begins counting his pulse rapidly) One, two, three, four, five, six, &c.
Alf. What's this? “To Sir Mark Chase, Warrender Hall—free—Alfred Highflyer.” My own frank! Warrender Hall! (looks about) —Sir! (with energy)
Sir Mark. What's the matter?
Alf. Warrender Hall!—it must be so. Sir, I am
[Page 26]
compelled to ask a delicate question—but the asylum for— (touching his head) —
Sir Mark. I know what you mean—'tis the very [125]   next house—here, you may see the high wall.
Alf. I see the high wall— that's the house I ought to have been taken to.
Sir Mark. Yes. I rather think it is—Oh! this accounts for his killing my macaw.
                                         (A Lute is heard.) Alf. A harp! Aye, aye, they are following up their sport; but if I don't mar it— (to Sir Mark) . I'll pretend to be deceived—I'll turn the tables on them: Egad! I'll give them a Roland for their Oliver.— Hark! what heavenly music! It comes from the azure canopy of—
Sir Mark. No, no, it comes from the blue parlour.
Alf. 'Tis the muse, Euterpe.
Sir Mark. No, 'tis Fanny Tiverton.
Alf. It whispers, 'tis a celestial lyre.
Sir Mark. 'Tis an infernal liar, if it whispers any such thing, because—
Alf. Divine music! What threw down the walls of Jerico? Music! What drew Eurydice from the shades? Music! How did Apollo build the Theban Wall? By Music!
Sir Mark. Music, quotha! I wonder what tune Apollo fiddled when he turned mason?
Alf. What tune? Stoneybatter—Tol de rol— (dances up the stage.)
Sir Mark. [150]   'Tis a clear case; I'll steal away, and give information at the next door, to secure him.—
                                         [Exit Sir Mark. Alf. Now, if I can find my grooms , and give them their cue . (Going, sees.) I shall be revenged on them all, for the trick they have play'd me.
Mrs. Fixture, who enters. Mrs. F. Well—I've got the secret from my husband at last. Oh! here's the gentleman in the green coat— Pity such a handsome man as Mr. Selborne should be married—I hope your honour's well, and your spouse. (curtsies).

[Page 27]
Alf. Spouse!
Mrs. F. Yes, Mr. Selborne, your real spouse.
Alf. Selborne! real spouse! (aside).
Mrs. F. Ah! you are surprised at my knowing the secret! but my husband has told me all.
Alf. Your husband?
Mrs. F. Is Fixture, the butler—don't be angry with him for telling me.
Alf. Not at all; on the contrary, I'm quite delighted.
Mrs. F. I say! what a trick you played that Mr. Highflyer—how like a fool he must look, ha! ha!
Alf. I dare say he does, ha! ha! (aside). Remarkably pleasant this.
Mrs. F. And has Sir Mark no suspicion of the trick you played him?
Alf. Oh! of the trick we played Sir Mark? Oh, no; [175]   and so your husband told you all—what, all about— eh?—
Mrs. F. Yes, all about your private marriage with Miss Tiverton, and pretending to Sir Mark, you had married Miss Darlington, and—
Alf. What do I hear! (aside). Maria unmarried! I shall betray myself—What a lucky fellow Fixture is, to have so discreet, and yet so blooming, and bewitching a wife?
Mrs. F. Oh, dear sir! but he's so jealous—
Alf. 'Tis always the case—those husbands are sure to be most jealous, whose wives give them the least reason.— (He puts his arm round her waist, and toys with her hand.)
Mrs. F. Very true, sir.
Alf. They are sure to misconstrue the most innocent freedoms.
                                         (Kisses her. Mrs. F. So they do, sir—now, I only went to Taunton Races with a friend, and he has made such a worret ever since, to find out who it was.
Alf. Taunton Races!—there's a rod in pickle for Mr. Fixture, who introduced me to this labyrinth of riddles.
                                         (Aside. Mrs. F. Here comes my old man—pray, don't say a word about the secret, or the races.
                                         (Exit. Alf. [200]   Oh, no!—

[Page 28]
Enter Fixture. Fix. (placing his hand above his eyes, to assist his sight). Why, yes,—it is her!
Alf. Good bye, you sly rogue—I shall see you again at Taunton Races.
Fix. Taunton races! (with solemn trepidation) — What do you know of Taunton races?
Alf. That my Filly bolted, and—
Fix. Don't talk of your bolting Filly, but tell me about mine. What do you know of that young person?
Alf. Don't be agitated, there's no cause for alarm— I certainly had the pleasure of seeing her there; but she was under the protection of an elderly gentleman.
Fix. Who?
Alf. A Sir Mark Chace, as I understood.
Fix. My master! oh, the hoary villain!
Alf. Therefore, your daughter—
Fix. Daughter! she's my wife! (in agony). If there be poison—or, what's more deadly—law, in the land, I'll—
                                         [Rushes out. Alf. Ha! ha! here comes the seducer—ha! ha!— I must avoid him, and give my grooms their instructions —I'll teach them to make me the victim of their plots.
                                         [Exit. Enter Sir Mark. Sir Mark. I've procured two persons to secure him; but where has the poor creature wandered?
Enter Mrs. Fixture. Mrs. F. [225]   I saw my old man scuttling along!
Sir Mark. Hannah! Have you seen Mr. Highflyer?
Mrs. F. No, sir; but I've seen Mr. Selborne — What a fine, easy, graceless gentleman!
Sir Mark. Very.
Mrs. F. But, I've a notion he's a wild one; he began rumpling me about.

[Page 29]
Sir Mark. Rumpling her about! was there ever such a devil of a fellow! Enter Fixture, behind, starts at seeing them. You must not listen to these young fellows—Fixture is disposed to be jealous,—therefore, my dear Hannah, be prudent, and you know, I'll always be your friend.— (Chucks her under the chin.)
                                         (Fixture, with dishevelled hair, and ghastly look, rushes in between them.) Fix. I dare say you will.
Sir Mark. Fixture! what's the matter with the man?
Mrs. F. He seems in pain—where's your complaint?
Fixt. In my head, in my heart—Taunton Races!— Oh, you young viper!—Oh, you old dragon!
Sir Mark. Old dragon! I see how it is—every soul in my family have lost their senses—and I shall soon be in the family way myself.
Fixt. Oh, you old poacher! There's your service— (snapping his fingers) —there's your livery— (throwing it off) —there's your baggage— (handing his wife over to Sir Mark) —I'll have law, and poison—an attorney, [250]   and an apothecary.
                                         (Rushes out. Sir Mark. Baggage!—old poacher!—no constitution can stand this!
                                         (Faintly. Mrs. F. Oh dear! oh dear!
Sir Mark. What's the matter with you?
Mrs. F. Indeed, I'm innocent of all such naughty doings, and I dare say, so are you, sir; at least, I'm sure you look innocent.
Sir Mark. Nonsense! now must I be tormented with her mewling. (Mrs. Fixture sobs violently.) Zounds! don't go into a fit. (Runs, and supports her in his arms. Enter Mr. Mrs. Selborne, and Maria. Come, come, don't take it so to heart, and I'll try to persuade Fixture, that he has no cause to be jealous of us—There, there!
                                         (Mr. Mrs. Selborne and Maria advance round Sir Mark.) Selb. The world's at an end!

[Page 30]
Maria. Oh, you naughty man, you naughty man! ha! ha!
Sir Mark. Confound you all! What do you mean? Go along, you hussy!
                                         (Exit Mrs. Fixture. Maria. Oh, Sir Mark!
Selb. Oh uncle!
Sir Mark. Oh nephew! you think by this ridiculous laugh to cover your own profligacy—she says you have been rumpling her about—she charges you with taking improper liberties.
Mrs. S. Selborne.) [275]   Is that true, George?
Selb. (to her) Upon my soul, I never saw her till this moment, I solemny assure you, my dear Fanny.
                                         (They go up the stage disputing. Maria. But now to find Alfred, and clear the mystery to him, I assure you, Sir Mark, your seeing Mr. Highflyer at my feet was the most innocent jest—
Sir Mark. I dare say it was (incredulously) ; but, poor fellow, he's past jesting with now.
Maria. What do you mean?
Sir Mark. Mean!—that he's gone—
Selb. Gone!
Sir Mark. Out of his senses.
Selb. Ha! ha!
Sir Mark. Come, come, 'tis no laughing matter— The poor creature owned he ought to have been taken to the next house—and when I told him you were married—
Maria. You told him I was married?
Sir Mark. To be sure.
Maria. Aye, then he stormed—
Sir Mark. No, he did not; he began dancing to the tune of Stoneybatter.
Maria. Dancing! then he is lost indeed.
Selb. Don't be alarmed—'tis some mistake of Sir Mark's.
Enter two Grooms (running) 1st Groom. [300]   You run that way, Sam—Stop—I've got him (clasping Selborne.)
Selb. (shaking him off) What, in the devil's name are you about?
1st Groom. Beg ten thousand pardons, sir—Oh,
[Page 31]
my poor master!—Ladies, you have not got him about you?
Maria. What do you mean? what master?
1st Groom. Mr. Highflyer, ma'am.
Maria. What of him?
1st Groom. Escaped, ma'am.
Maria. Escaped!
St. Mark. Did not I say so?
1st Groom. Yes, ma'am, escaped from us, ma'am, and he gave us the slip, ma'am.—He'll do some mischief! eh! my poor—eh! there he is—I see him— follow.
                                         [Exeunt Grooms. St. Mark. There, did not I tell you? (a great noise of breaking glass.) Confound him! he has got into the greenhouse—Here, Gardener—Fixture, Gregory!
Sel. Courage, Maria!
Maria. I shall never recover the shock to assume derangement—to—an unfortunate, that was its victim. —Dreadful idea! Oh, Alfred! and have I only found you faithful to lose you for ever!
Sel. [325]   Nay, I alone was to blame; let us seek him.
Maria. Music had always the greatest power over him. Sing my dear Frances, try, by its influence, to attract him hither. Come, sir,—poor lost Alfred!
                                         [Exeunt. Enter Alfred, his dress a little deranged. Alf. Ha! ha! I have escaped the Baronet,—now, if I can find the bride, I'll give Mr. Selborne a pleasant half hour.—Who have we here? by heaven's, a Hebe! (retires.)
SONG. Mrs. Selborne.
Sweet soothing lyre,
Thy mystic power prevailing,
And my weak song,
      To calm the troubled breast;
Lull by thy strains—
The anguished heart,
Hush by thy spell,
      The troubled soul to rest.
Ah, pleasing power,
   Hush every grove;
And harmonize the soul
   To peace and love.
[Page 32]
Alfred advances. Mrs. Selborne utters a loud scream. Alf. 'Tis just, that the breast, which causes such emotions, should, in its turn, be agitated.
Mrs. S. Oh! he's quite temperate, I'm glad I have such influence over him—I must practice the soothing system.
Alf. [350]   Your voice, fair creature, wrapt my soul in sweet oblivion—but your animated beauties wake me to admiration, to delight.
Mrs. S. There's nothing flighty in that; on the contrary, I think he talks very sensibly. Sir, if my humble powers of pleasing can contribute to your happiness.
Alf. Oh lady, at first your eyes dazzled by their lustre; but the beams of kindness they now emit, kindle a flame, pure as the ray that vivified it.
Mrs. S. How rationally he expresses himself! but, sir, were you not attached to Miss Darlington?
Alf. Formerly; but she's now married, and, indeed, so happy, that I rejoice in their union—even now I saw the happy pair reclining on a mossy bank.
Mrs. S. On a mossy bank!
Alf. The grove echoed with their kisses.
Mrs. S. Kisses! where are they? (going out.)
Alf. 'Tis a retreat, hallowed by wedded love—we must not profane it.
Enter Selborne and Maria, (observed by Alfred.) Maria. There they are.
Selb. But what are they about?
Alf. Instead of interrupting, let us emulate their happiness. May I not be allowed to approach the shrine of my adoration?
Mrs. S. I must not irritate him (aside.)
Alf. [375]   May I not be permitted to enfold the object of my idolatry; to offer an oblation of ten thousand kisses. (Takes her round the waist, and kisses her hand rapturously.)
                                         (Selborne and Maria rush in between them. Alfred throws himself into a garden chair, amuses himself in blowing the leaves of a flower, or some idiotic trifling.) Selb. Fanny! what are you about, Fanny?
Maria. My dear friend, what are you about?

[Page 33]
Mrs. S. Practising the soothing system.
Selb. The soothing system! zounds, ma'am, the irritating system.
Maria. Is this your friendship? this your return for my—
Mrs. S. Acting to perfection—the character of a loving wife.
Selb. To be found in a man's arms!
Mrs. S. To recline on a mossy bank—to make a grove echo with kisses!
Selb. Madam, the evidence of my eyes—
Mrs. S. Sir, the evidence of my ears—
Maria. Hush! hush! you forget the unhappy object who sits there, unconscious of the misery he occasions —Selborne, be composed—depend on't, he mistook your wife for me.
Selb. Possibly; but I'll take care he don't make the same mistake again.
                                         (Taking his wife under his arm, and wiping the hand Alfred has kissed.) Maria. Mention my name to him—say I'm near, but with caution.
Selb. (to Alfred) [400]   Sir, I believe you are acquainted with Miss Darlington?
Alf. Oh yes, sir—I knew Miss Darlington.
Sel. She is here.
Alf. Is she?—Ah! how do you do? Give you joy nice weather, is not it?—Been at Brighton lately?
Maria. Oh! quite lost—quite irrational!
Mrs. S. I own, I cannot perceive it.
Alf. Ladies, won't you walk, and enjoy this smiling landscape? How lovely nature has here distributed her charms (between the ladies) , I've just come from Brighton—bow, wow, wow! (barks like a dog.) —been bathing there—the doctors call it being dipt .—Dam' the fellows!—they almost drowned me.
Maria. But—but—why—did—did they order you to be dipt?
Alf. Why? Ask me not the cause—it strikes upon my brain. 'Tis here! and here! and there! and every where! Ha! ha! ha!—Oh! oh! (seems convulsed.)
Maria. What's the matter?
Alf. Spasms! spasms!—Ha! ha! ha!
                                         (Rises up, seems more convulsed, and falls into Maria's arms, exhausted.)
[Page 34]
Maria. Oh! that he could know my feelings—that he could hear my vow, that I will never be another's.
Alf. But will you be mine? Are you not married?
Maria. [425]   Are you not out of your senses?
Alf. Yes, with joy! Oh! Maria, how we have trifled with our happiness. But explain.
Sel. Suffice it, my pretended marriage with this lady, was to prevent my uncle disinheriting me.
Alf. And your real wife—
Sel. Is here—let this embrace vouch for my veracity and my happiness.
                                         (Embraces Mrs. Selborne.) Alf. And this for mine (embracing Maria.)
Enter Sir Mark and Domestics. Sir Mark. There they are, all hugging again, madman and all. You audacious devils! what are you laughing at? But you shall be divorced—you shall be divorced, if it cost me ten thousand pounds.
Sel. Sir, it shan't cost you a penny.
Maria, Not a penny, Sir.
Sir Mark. Why, ar'n't you married, George?
Sel. Yes, Sir—to this lady.
Sir Mark. And you are— (to Maria.)
Maria. Going to be married to this gentleman.
                                         (bowing.) Sir Mark. But, George, to deceive your uncle.
Sel. Sir, that horrid new shilling you threatened me with.
Sir Mark. What, my favourite Maria to plot against me! Well, well, come here, you pretty rogue, and kiss your uncle (kisses Mrs. Selborne.) Well, now, [450]   I have only to alter my will, and perhaps the day after to-morrow you may be in possession; at present, I'm as well as any man in England.
Maria. Then, dear Sir Mark, let well alone.
Sir Mark. And don't you want to dance over my grave?
Mrs. S. No, Sir; we want you to dance at our wedding.

[Page 35]
Sir Mark. Do you? Ecod! here goes—let's have the fiddles. Maria, you shan't want a dower.
FINALE.
Heart with heart uniting,
Village bells inviting,
Marriage vows delighting,
If you allow the bands. CHORUS.
   Heart with heart, &c. SECOND SOLO.
I your presence courting,
Ask your kind resorting,
To protect your sporting
O'er our fairy lands. CHORUS.
   Heart with heart, &c. Back matter

[Page 1]
Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A Sea-port in Surinam.—One side of the Stage occupied by Habitations of Wood, with striped Verandas.—Muslin Shades in lieu of Glass.—Orange Trees in fruit before the Doors.—On the other side a Fortification, Flag-staff, &c. backed by the view of a Bay.—Music. Officer, Somerdyke , Slaves, and Boy, discovered. — Somerdyke looking through a Telescope. GLEE. Planters, Negro Girl, and Planters' Boy. Planters' Boy.
Blow, gentle gales, and on your wing
Our long-expected succours bring. 2d Planter.
Look, look again! 1st Planter.
                                         'Tis all in vain! Boy.
Lo! behold a pennant waving! Planters & Girl.
'Tis the sea-birds' pinions laving! All.
Hark! a signal fills the air! Planters.
'Tis the beething rocks resounding;
'Tis the hollow wave rebounding, All.
Wild as our hopes;—deep as our despair! (Guns discharged, shouts heard at a distance).
[Page 2]
Som. See! a fleet!
Offic. 'Tis the expected succour from England. Hoist the colours!
(Inhabitants rush in). Som. My friends, the Colony is safe!— Surinam is preserved—here are our deliverers!
Enter Planter. Offic. March out the garrison.
(The Citadel Gates are thrown open, and Soldiers march out). (Governor and Train enter—Soldiers present arms). Plant. Make room, the Governor is landing.
1 Off. Hail to the noble Governor of Surinam!
1 Plant. All happiness to your Excellency! Huzza! Huzza! Huzza!
(Inhabitants join in cheering the Governor). Gov. There, that will do very well: really, your flattering welcome is so beyond my humble merits, that I am at a loss to account for this very warm reception, (Fanning himself with his hat) [25]   and this overpowering affection, (Pushing them aside, as they press on him).
Plant. Are you not come to save our lives?
Gov. Oh, that's it.
Som. Is not the negro rebellion at its heighth? And, but for your presence, wouldn't every Dutchman be massacred?
Gov. Aye, that accounts for your regard for me very satisfactorily. Well, now, as we perfectly understand each other, we'll proceed to business. It seems then, that the negro rebellion is in full vigour and triumph.

[Page 3]
Som. O, dreadful! I dare say there are now a hundred in ambush in my plantation; so, pray, go there directly.
Gov. Thank you, kind, Sir, a thousand times. What use have the revolted negroes made of their acquired liberty?
Som. To burn, insult, and massacre even their own countrymen.
Gov. Indeed! then have at them; for on none can the chastisement of severity be more justly visited, than on those who pervert the noblest prerogative of man, into man's bitterest curse. (Pointing to Slaves, who are ranged in the back scene). Those, I suppose, are my slaves? (Officer bows assent). Are they all faithful?
Off. [50]   All! (Slaves bow, and then call out, “Gambia! Gambia!”)
Gov. Gambia! what does that mean?
Off. 'Tis the name of a favourite slave—they wish him to address you.
Gov. Gambia, stand forth!
Gam. These slaves offer to their master the homage of their obedience, the humble pledge of their fidelity. For their faults, they solicit your mercy—for their helplessness, they entreat your pity—for their wrongs, they implore your protection—So, may you live in freedom, die in the arms of your children, and your spirit be wafted to the promised land of your fathers.
Gov. Well, this speech has, at any rate, one strong recommendation belonging to it—'tis a short one—But, come hither, Gambia, you say, they entreat, they implore—have you nothing to offer?
Gam. No.
Gov. No petition to present?

[Page 4]
Gam. None.
Gov. No misery to endure?
Gam. Misery! Sir, I am a slave:—In that, all human wretchedness is comprehended.
Gov. [75]   Have you been long a slave?
Gam. Oh, for ages.
Off. Not a twelvemonth, your Excellency.
Gov. I understand him—I declare I fancy him—I dare say he's a good sort of rascal, for I don't see the mark of the whip.
Gam. Whip! Patience, kind Heaven! Sir, I am of giant strength—the negro's toils, performed with groans, and paid with stripes, are to me boyish pastime; Nature has kindly fitted me to my fate.
Gov. I think not; you have not merited your wretched lot.
Gam. Indeed, Sir, I have.
Gov. Your story—
Gam. Is soon told. In Africa I was a slave.
Gov. A slave?
Gam. The vilest—the slave of fierce ambition; revell'd in luxuries purchased by blood; stimulated by Europe's baubles, hunted my fellow-men—But the hunter was taken in the toils; just, full retribution, even to the uttermost pang, is now my doom; that freedom I denied to others, is now far from my hopes as hell from heaven; that country, stained with [100]   my crimes, sends its burning breeze across the main, to fire my brain to madness. That innocent man I sold to slavery—he has pardon'd me. Can I forgive myself?
Off. He does all he can, poor fellow, to atone—performs the labour of both.
Gov. Indeed! Why did you not join your rebellious countrymen here?

[Page 5]
Gam. Because there is a state worse than slavery—liberty engendered by treachery, nursed by rapine, and invigorated by cruelty.
Gov. I shall think of him. My portfolio. (Portfolio is brought by Secretary, which he opens). See these instructions forwarded to the proper officers. (Officer distributes them among the Slaves) . This letter to the Provost—these to the estate of Mrs. Lindenburg.
Gam. Be those my care.
                                         [Exit in great haste. Gov. His alacrity pleases me.
Off. 'Tis love gives him speed; for at Mrs. Lindenburg's lives a female Quadroon slave, named Zelinda.
Gov. What, Captain Clifton's mistress?
Off. The same.
Gov. Why, those letters announce Clifton's return.
Off. [125]   Poor Gambia! did he know their contents, they'd be the heaviest burden he ever groaned under. His business in Europe was to purchase her freedom.
Gov. True; but in an evil hour Clifton fell among sharpers and gamesters—the hard-earned gains of a soldier became the prey of cowardly plunderers, and he returns to Surinam poorer than he left it. Who have we here?
Som. The Dutch Ladies of the Colony come to welcome your Excellency.
Enter Miss Von Frump , and Ladies, attended by Slaves, bearing Umbrellas and Fans. Miss V. F. In the name of the fair inhabitants, I, their representative, congratulate your
[Page 6]
Excellency on your return to Surinam. Have you forgot me, Governor?
Gov. Forgot you!—time, Madam, has as vainly been employed in erasing you from my memory, as I see his efforts have been unavailing in lessening the charms of the late Miss Von Frump—but what your name now is—?
Miss V. F. Oh, Miss Von Frump still.
Gov. Forbid it, gallantry—forbid it, taste!
Miss V. F. Ah, General, I have abandon'd the hope—pshaw! I mean the wish, of altering my virgin state—so much so, that I have sent [150]   for my nephew from England, to adopt him as my heir. My family, Sir, the Dutch Frumps, form'd an alliance with the English Fogrums.
Gov. Indeed! then Madam, I had the honour of being shipmate with the representative of the Frumps and the Fogrums.
Miss V. F. And is he a charming youth?
Gov. You shall judge for yourself, for he is now landing; and that you may judge the better, suppose for a few moments you conceal your name from him.
Miss V. F. Admirable thought! he will then speak of me with unembarrass'd gratitude and affection.
Gov. Probably.
[ Fogrum without.] Fog. There, I'll give you no more; so, go along, ye horrid men of tar.
Sailors. (Without). Ha! ha!
Enter Fogrum , and two Sailors. Fog. I tell you, it won't do; I that know every fare from the bridges down
[Page 7]
to Limehouse-hole—What, you won't go? Holloa, York, you're wanted.
Enter Sam Sharpset —he sends off Sailors. Miss V. F. Who is that?
Gov. His name is Sharpset: he's his Yorkshire mentor, Hearing of tricks upon travellers, [175]   he hired this Yorkshireman, and united, they consider themselves a match for the keenest.
Fogrum and Sharpset advance. Fog. Ha! ha! ha! try to take us in! No, no, that won't do, I say, Garlic Hill and Black Hamilton an't easy beat.
Miss V. F. I vow, he seems agreeable at a distance.
Gov. Yes, at a distance he is very agreeable.
Fog. Well, here we are at last, on sound terrestrial terrumfirmum ground. Do you know, that tho' as yet I've seen nothing but water and sky, I somehow feel amazingly improved by my travels (looking about, and stretching his limbs) . Oh, there's old Governor —how tired I was of seeing his ill-looking countenance!
Gov. What's that?
Fog. Upon my honour, I did not mean you should hear me—I only—that is—I meant—no, I did not—yes, I—York, you're wanted (handing Sam Sharpset to Governor).
Sam S. Yes, your Excellency, he only meant—he was tired of seeing—
Gov. My ill-looking countenance!

[Page 8]
Sam S. No, your countenance looking ill— [200]   that was it.
Fog. Lud a mercy! I'm afraid I've said something pointed.
Sam S. Don't you be frighten'd about that.
Fog. I should be shocked, Governor, if I was too hard for you.
Gov. So should I, believe me—Now attend me to the citadel. Madam, good morning.
                                         [Exit, attended. Fog. Why, York, only think—I declare they have got ladies here!
Sam S. Ladies! to be sure they have, or how—In short, 'tis quite natural there should be ladies, you know—I say, ask one of them about your old aunt, that's going to die, and leave you all her money.
Fog. I will— (He addresses Miss Von Frump) —Ma'am, permit a youth, well known in the region of the Tower Hamlets, sitiated in Europe, to enquire if in any of your West Inge streets, you happen to know a superannuated Dutch Frow, named Von Frump?
Miss V. F. If 'tis Miss Von Frump you mean—
Fog. Yes, that's her; she never had the luck to get married—nobody never would have [225]   her. You must know, Ma'am, I am imported here on rather a sepulchral concern—the old girl finding herself kicking, sent for me to be her heir. (She turns away disgusted.) —Ah! you turn away—I see how it is, but I'm prepared for the worst—I've brought a black coat with me—Oh! (weeps) .
Miss V. F. Dry your tears, young man, for
[Page 9]
Miss Von Frump is not only alive, but never enjoyed higher health than at this moment.
Fog. Ah, that won't do—He! he! he!—You want to make me cry in earnest.
Miss V. F. In earnest!
Fog. He! he! you only say that to frighten me—yes, you do—high health truly—why, her hearing's quite gone.
Miss V. F. Indeed!
Fog. And as for her lungs, poor miserable soul, she can't use them.
Miss V. F. Can't she? That shall be tried, however. Ah hem! know, thou degenerate Fogrum, that Miss Von Frump stands before you! ( Sam Sharpset whistles). —Who, in a fit of absurd caprice, could not be satisfied till she had seen you—I have seen [250]   you, and am quite satisfied.
Fog. Now, here's a pretty swindle! (to Sam Sharpset) .
Sam S. Be quiet.
Fog. Why, 'tis false pretences.
Miss V. F. Wretch! hear my last words.
Fog. Your last words! with the greatest pleasure.
Miss V. F. Finally to extinguish your hopes, know, I will this day send my promise of espousal to the elegant Mr. Sharpset.
Fog. York, that's your name—There's a Sharpset here already.
Sam S. I shou'dn't wonder; the Sharpsets are a very increasing family.
Miss V. F. Yes, I will marry, tho' 'tis to one of my own black slaves.
Fog. Now don't; why, to spite me, punish an innocent man? My dear old aunt, I can't
[Page 10]
bear it—I—that is, you—no—York, you're wanted.
Sam S. That you should be connubially inclined, Madam, is quite natural; the wonderment is, the ceremony is yet to be perform'd.
Miss V. F. Hem! (smiles).
Sam S. But why talk of black slaves, when [275]   those of a prettier complexion would be proud to be slaves to so bonny a lady. Ha! (sighs) — that will do it! (aside).
Miss V. F. His friend makes atonement.
Sam S. I've settled it (to Fogrum). It's all right enough now.
Miss V. F. But how, Sir, can you excuse that unfeeling Fogrum?
Sam S. Why, Ma'am, you must know that he's fallen so desperately in love with Captain Clifton's sister, Miss Stella, that I verily think it has damaged his lunatics—Love, you know, Ma'am, makes strange combustion wi' us, suspectible swains—heigho!
Miss V. F. Well, if love be his malady, I may perhaps not utterly discard him!—Slaves! (they advance).
Fog. Oh lud!
Sam S. Don't you be frighten'd.
Miss V. F. Conduct these gentlemen where they may obtain refreshment.
                                         (Slaves hold Umbrellas over their heads, and a Female precedes each, fanning them). Sam S. I say, 'Squire Fogrum. (Chucking Slave under the chin).
Fog. What?
Sam S. Nothing.
Fog. York!
Sam S. Eh!

[Page 11]
Fog. [300]   You're not wanted.
                                         [Exeunt under the Canopies. Miss V. F. Here comes a liberal importation of officers, and who knows but after a voyage, uncheered by the rays of beauty, that I may dazzle, and they may adore.—A lady with them! pshaw! they are a drug in the market already.
Enter Captains Clifton and Malcolm , with Stella . Other Officers enter and pass off, bowing to Stella . Clift. Welcome, my dear Stella, after shipwreck and sorrow, welcome to Surinam. Ah, Miss Von Frump, give me leave to introduce—
Miss V. F. Your wife, I suppose.
Clift. My sister, Madam.
Miss V. F. Then there's hopes.
Clift. You know I left my heart at Surinam.
Miss V. F. I know! How should I know, Captain?
Clift. Tell me of my Zelinda—where?
Miss V. F. I know nothing of other folks' slaves—plague enough with my own. Ah, Miss, you have come into a sad country for changing your condition into that connubial state religion enjoins.
Malc. Faith, Madam, we Britons o' the North are famed all the world over for foreknowledge and second-sight; so, to prevent so severe an affliction to so bonny a lassie, I've [325]   struck the flag of Independence, swore allegiance to Love, and hope to pilot her into the haven of Matrimony.
Miss V. F. What, he engaged too!—the devil's in the men, I think!
                                         [Exit.
[Page 12]
Clift. Stella, adieu! I fly to Mrs. Lindenburg, to prepare her to receive the embraces of my dearest sister.
Stella. Very prettily said; but which I interpret —I fly to Mrs. Lindenburg, to prepare Zelinda to receive the embraces of her dearest Clifton.
Clift. Well, be it so. Can I forget that Zelinda preserved my life, nay more, blest, endeared, gave value to the life she saved? Never, Farewell! I'll soon return. Excuse—
Malc. Away with you—To leave a lad and lassie together, requires a far shorter apology than ye seem inclined to honour us with.
Clift. Well, defend your prize, for here comes an enemy to attack it. So stand to your guns, brave Captain—
                                         [Exit. Enter Fogrum and Sam Sharpset . Fog. Bless my soul! 'tis shocking sultry—I declare I'm all in a melt.
Sam S. Damn the [350]   musquitoes!
Fog. Celestial heaven! do my ocular eyes deceive me? No, 'tis my sweetheart, Miss Stella —La! I'm so glad. And so, you've been at the bottom of the sea, Miss—Any thing to be seen there? And pray, Miss, how did you get up again?
Stella. By the intrepid exertions of this gentleman (taking Malcolm's hand).
Fog. Well, you need not trouble yourself to thank him, because I'll do something very genteel for him. (Malcolm takes Fogrum by the shoulder, and turns him from Stella).
[Page 13]
—Now that's much more familiar than agreeable.
Malc., Stella. Ha! ha! ha!
Fog. Oh, I don't mind folks laughing at me. I've made my mind up about that, or I should have a pretty time of it. But, Sir, I demand— that is, I request—that is, I beg—that is— York, you're wanted—I say, here's a fellow pretends—
Sam S. Never mind, be quiet—I'll soon settle him.
Fog. Yes, we'll do for him; but don't let us be too hard upon the poor wretch.
Sam S. Hem! I say, Captain, a word or two, if you please.
Mal. [375]   Well, Sir, what are your commands?
Sam S. Wheugh! (Whistles).
Fog. What's the matter?
Sam S. A Scotchman!
Mal. Yes, Sir; and what then?
Sam S. Only, Sir, I give in—I know my place—I yield—It's all settled.
Fog. Settled! why an't you a match—?
Sam S. A Yorkshireman a match for a Scotchman! Lord help you!
Fog. Why, I thought you were far north—
Sam S. Yes, just far enough to know who's farther. Why, bless you, when they come into Yorkshire, we say—“How do ye do, gentlemen? Pray walk on—Don't stop for the want of a little money—that's the road to the South —good journey, gentlemen.”—Lord bless you, we know well enough what we are about, mun.
Fog. Come here—If I was you, I tell you what I'd do—I'd say something damn'd clever to him.

[Page 14]
Sam S. Would you? Well, I'll try; but its no use.
Mal. What gars ye glower se, mon?
Sam S. [400]   Oh, I'm not at all surpris'd at seeing you here; for, go where you will, you are sure to find a Scotchman.
Mal. Then, gang where you wull, you are sure to meet with exemplary industry, uncorruptible integrity, and unquestion'd courage.
Sam S. There, I told you it was no use— so come along.
Fog. He little suspects how I'll give it him, some day.
                                         [Exeunt. Mal. And will the blithsome day ever come, when I shall welcome the girl of my heart to my native Highland home?
SONG— Malcolm .

My Highland home, where tempests blow,
   And cold thy wint'ry looks,
Thy mountains crown'd wi' driven snow,
   And ice-bound are thy brooks;
But colder far's the Briton's heart,
   However far he roam,
To whom these words no joy impart—
   “My native Highland home!”
Then gang wi' me to Scotland dear,
   We ne'er again will roam,
And with thy smile so bonny, cheer
   My native Highland home.

[425]   When summer comes, the heather-bell
   Shall tempt thy feet to rove;
The cushat dove within the dell,
   Invite to peace and love:
For blithsome is the breath of day,
   And sweet's the bonny broom,
And pure the dimpling rills that play
   Around my Highland home.
Then gang wi' me, &c.
[Page 15]
SCENE II. Portrait of a Mangrove Tree. Enter Zelinda , who leans despondingly against the Tree. Enter Mrs. Lindenburg , with Zelinda's Child. Mrs. L. My little adopted, where did you leave your mother? where is Zelinda?
Child. There, under the mangrove tree— Mother!
(Runs to Zelinda, who advances). Mrs. L. My poor Zelinda! what, still drooping, still in tears?
Zel. Good Lady, dearest Mistress, do not think your poor slave ungrateful—indeed I feel all your goodness till my poor heart aches with its burthen. Ah Lady! none but the depised can feel how sweet it is not to be despised.
Mrs. L. Nay, I only fulfil a pleasing duty, made more grateful by a promise I made to Clifton, that in his absence—
Zel. Oh! think you, Madam, he will return? You avert your eye—Alas! I know that love for poor Zelinda may fly from his bosom, but I know that honour cannot—He will not forget he is a father.
(Turning to the Child, and enfolding it, continuing to look at it with affection).
[Page 16]
Enter Servant, who delivers Letters. Mrs. L. Letters from Europe—from my dear son, Lindenburg—then he will soon be here—Ah! (Aside) One in Clifton's character. Till I know its contents, she shall be ignorant of its arrival—Follow me, and rejoice, for my [25]   first request to Lindenburg, will be the freedom of Zelinda, and my little adopted Englishman.
                                         [Exeunt Mrs. Lindenburg, and Child. Gam. Zelinda!
Zel. Who calls?
Gam. Zelinda!
Zel. Gambia here!
Enter Gambia . Gam. Even that wretch—Do not avoid me.
Zel. Gambia, forget, and leave me.
Gam. Leave you! Bid the parched traveller in the desert avoid the fountains—thou art the only sweet that's mingled in my cup of bitterness —When the task of toil is done, and I ask the moon with its cold dews to bathe my throbbing brow, and the night winds to allay the fever that consumes me, 'tis thy image that shields me from despair, thou art my sun, I live but in thy light—thy words, my food; my drink, thy balmy breath.
Zel. Gambia, I must not, will not hear you.
Gamb. Ah! still vainly hoping for the ingrate who has abandoned thee; think'st thou he will return? or, grant he comes, will it not be to spurn thy proffer'd love? What, constancy or gratitude to a slave! The white cheek
[Page 17]
of Europe would be crimsoned at the monstrous [50]   indignity—
Zel. Gambia, you tear my heart, and basely wrong the father of my child.
Gam. Thy child! ungrateful woman, must I remind thee, when roused by thy shrieks, I found the huge Aboma serpent had twined its hideous folds around thy sleeping infant—when all else fled the scaly monster, I alone dared the deadly conflict; grappled his hideous crest, buried my hatchet in his brain, and woke thee from thy death-cold trance, by the warm embraces of thy preserved child.
Zel. Oh, think me not ungrateful—can I forget it? Never!
Gam. And can I forget how Zelinda hung upon my neck; strained me to her arms—her heaving bosom pressed against my throbbing heart—forget—not love! What, plunge me in flame, and tell me not to burn—place heaven before me, and bid me not adore! (Kneels).
(Mrs. Lindenburg , without). Mrs. L. Happy Zelinda! Clifton is returned!
Gam. Returned! (starting up).
Zel. Blessed moment! Gambia, farewell—
Gam. Stay, I command thee, and mark my words—Europe's cold sons may sink into nerveless [75]   apathy; but Afric's fiery children know no sleep of passion—Liberty lost, love unrequited, hope extinguished!—what remains to fill this bosom, but revenge, precious, sweet revenge! Let your proud son of freedom tremble at the vengeance of a slave.

[Page 18]
Enter Child. Child. Mother, my father's coming!
Gam. Ah! his son—
Zel. Mercy! mercy!
Child. Why do you cry, mother? This is dear Gambia, that saved my life. You hold me so far from you, Gambia, I cannot kiss you.
Gam. His mother's voice! his mother's smile! (kisses him) —Fiends could not harm thee— Lost, lost for ever! (rushes out).
Clift. Where is she, where is my Zelinda? Enter Clifton . (Entering). My boy—my beloved!
Zel. What, still beloved of Clifton! Art thou then the same?
Clift. Yes; for even poverty has not forsaken me. I possess'd the means of rescuing the objects of my fondest love, from slavery's chains; but intemperance surrounded, temptation beckoned, avarice pushed me on, [100]   ruin followed, and with it bitterest repentance.
Zel. That heaven, the christian path to which you taught me to tread, will not desert us, therefore dearest friend—
Clift. Friend! is that a lover's welcome?
Zel. Clifton, hear me. The sacred truths you taught me, I believed—believing, I obey. I still may be thy tender, faithful friend—still a fond mother to this helpless boy—still the slave of man, but not the slave of vice.
Clift. Sweet monitress! how well she instructs me in my duty! Look up, dear suffering virtue, and rejoice, for this day heaven
[Page 19]
shall receive our vows—Yes, this day makes thee a wife!
Zel. Best of men!—kneel with me, my boy —lift up thy innocent hands, in thanks, in gratitude—
Clift. Rise, and share my heart! (raises them). These precious moments I have stolen from duty—that dispatched, I will return.
Zel. Stay—I must guard you against a danger —there is a slave called Gambia—
Clift. What of him?
Zel. With a too partial eye he has seen—
Clift. He loves thee, Zelinda.
Zel. [125]   Alas!
Clift. Presumptuous—
Zel. Nay, we owe him gratitude, for he preserved this darling's life. Avoid him, Clifton, for he threatens dreadful vengeance; and to his nation, revenge is virtue.
Clift. Fear nothing—I will be all you wish. Come, my boy.
Zel. And must you go so soon? Farewell!                                          [Exit Clifton. —Go, and make known to all, thy mother's happiness.                                          [Exit Child. —What sounds are those?—Ah, the note of the mocking-bird. Sweet songstress, thou who hast so often echoed my strains of woe, now strive to emulate the song of joy.
SONG— Zelinda.
Living Echo! Bird of eve!
Hush thy wailing—cease to grieve!
Feather'd warbler, wake the grove
To notes of joy—to songs of love!
Pretty Mocking-bird—thy form I see
Swinging with the breeze, on the mangrove tree!
[Page 20]
SCENE III. A View of a Sugar Plantation—Buildings arranged on each side—The centre of the Stage occupied by a Plantation of Sugar Canes—Negro Huts in the back ground. Sharpset and Planters, without. Sharp. But, gentlemen, only till to-morrow.
1 Plant. Nonsense, I will be paid; or to jail you go.
They enter. Sharp. Really, gentlemen, this is very hard usage; very hard indeed, not to hear me, when I was going to pay you all—
2 Plant. To pay us all!
Sharp. Yes, going to pay you all—a compliment.
1 Plant. Nonsense!
Sharp. I'll give you—
2 Plant. What?
Sharp. My honor—
1 Plant. Pugh! give us the truth.
Sharp. The truth do you want? Then by my soul you shall have it—ye vultures, ye cormorants, have not I made all your fortunes? Did I ever honor a bill when it became due? and when I have paid you on a Monday, did I ever let Tuesday pass without borrowing again? What, cage the decoy-duck, when a flock of wild ones are in sight? Is not a fleet arrived laden with commodities, exclusively consigned to my use?

[Page 21]
1 Plant. What commodities?
Sharp. [25]   Fools! are articles of certain importation, and always marketable. Behold a couple of victims that shall be sacrificed to appease you. Stand back, I say, and give me room.—
                                         (They retire). Enter Fogrum and Sam Sharpset . Fog. Ecod, 'tis well I brought these bills of credit—what I call the transformables—or we might have been worserer off than the Blackies.
Sam S. I say, look there—that's a great man—how they gather round him, just like a parcel of Legs round a Pigeon at Doncaster races.
Fog. He's coming this way. Suppose I call up a smile, and risk a bow?
Sharp. Strangers and countrymen —a double claim to my protection.
Fog. There's for you! Great Sir, I am a man—no—yes—that is, we—York, you're wanted.
Sharp. We are both strangers, noble Sir, but not both countrymen, because he's a Londoner —and— (Looking up at him) —Eh! no, sure— why it is—Lud a mercy! May I just ask your noble name?
Sharp. Matthew Sharpset, Esquire.
Sam S. 'Tis him—huzza! (Snaps his fingers) . [50]   'Tis brother Matty! Yorkshire for ever! Why, Matty, hast thou forgotten little Sammy?
Sharp. The devil!—Ah, little Sammy, is it you? How do you do? What, you heard of my greatness, eh, little Sammy, and so—
Sam S. Bless you, not I—all your kin-folk thought you were drowned—I own I did not
[Page 22]
draw that conclusion myself. I say, what a fine thing brotherly love is?
Sharp. Oh, delightful!
Sam S. I conclude now, this is all your fine estate that we see here.
Sharp. No, my estate's quite out of sight. Your friend, Mr.—
Fog. Fogrum.
Sharp. A very ancient name. The Sharpsets have always depended on the Fogrums. What may those bits of paper be, Sir?
Fog. Bills, and letters of credit, Sir.
Sharp. Nobody understands credit better than I.
Fog. I suppose I shall want money.
Sharp. I think it very likely. (Taking another.)
Fog. I must see what's to be seen, you know —I didn't come here for nothing.
Sharp. [75]   Nor shall you remain here for nothing — (Taking another).
Fog. These must be cashed—they are indorsed.
Sharp. My dear Sir, my people will fly to effect it.— (With authority) Come here all of you.— (Apart to them) There, gorge on your quarry, vultures.— (Aloud) Begone!
                                         [Exeunt Creditors. Sam S. How attentive they are to you.
Sharp. Yes! Damn them! (Aside).
Fog. I suppose they'll keep the money safe?
Sharp. You may depend upon it. And have not you brought some little investment? Eh, Sammy?
Sam S. Just to turn the honest penny like— I've brought some skaits.
Sharp. Skaits! the greatest rarity here.

[Page 23]
Sam S. Ah! I thought so—and some double-mill'd drab great-coats, lined with flannel.
Sharp. Faugh! (fanning himself) —A hit, Sammy—there is not such a thing in the colony.
Sam S. Ah! let me alone.
Sharp. Any thing else?
Sam S. Only a little matter of treacle, and pig-tailed backy—
Sharp. To the West Indies—Any coals?
Sam S. [100]   No coals.
Sharp. Those of course you sent to Newcastle —Well, gentlemen, if I can further serve you—
Fog. Kind Sir, if you could reconcile me to my aunt, Miss Von Frump—you must know the old girl wants to be married.
Sharp. Yes, I do know that.
Fog. And so we have planned—excuse my mentioning it, but we are a couple of deep ones —He! he!
Sharp. Ah, my dear Sir, you need not mention that.
Fog. York, here, is to marry her, and we are to go snacks.
Sharp. Zounds! the key-stone of my hopes undermined—I must counter-plot. Really, (leaning on Fogrum's shoulders) Sir, you are too much for us poor fellows. (To Fogrum).
Sam S. Ah, Matty, Matty, thou'rt at thy old tricks of bamboozeling and flummerying.
Sharp. Hush!—I would not attempt imposing on your good sense.
Sam S. My good sense—Come, no flattery— it won't do with me.
Sharp. [125]   Won't it—I'll try—I only said it, to see if my brother retained the same frank
[Page 24]
heart, as I perceive he does the same open, handsome countenance.
Sam S. Why, there's no alteration for the worse there, I believe.
Sharp. Ha! ha! For the present, adieu! I'll meet you at Miss Von Frump's.
Fog. We shall easily find you out.
Sharp. I hope not. Oh yes—the fact is, I'm more known here, than suits either my wishes or convenience. Beware of impostors!
Fog. Your caution is, I dare say, very well meant—but let them match York Minster—
Sam S. And Bow bell—if they can.                                          [Exeunt Fogrum and Sam Sharpset. Enter Captain Clifton . Captain Clifton! welcome, heartily welcome!
Clift. Ah, Sharpset. you here too!—You remember I became your security for 500 dollars, which—
Sharp. Oh, my infernal stars! that the warm joy of meeting an old friend, must be chilled by the consciousness of a pecuniary obligation.
Clift. Nay, I mention'd the Bond only, because I unluckily feel an inability to discharge it for you. (Enter Slave, who delivers a Letter to Sharpset ). [150]   But, Sharpset, why don't you marry? there's your old flame, Miss Von Frump—
Sharp. Egad, your question's a-propos— for here's the kind soul's connubial promise—
[Page 25]
but liberty, precious liberty! while I can, I'll keep thee—for 'tis nobler to suffer a creditor to say—“You profligate, I put you into jail,” than for a wife to say—“You shab, I took you out of one.”
                                         [Exit. Enter Governor and Officers, followed by Planters. Clift. Governor, this unlooked for honour—
Gov. Clifton, this night we give to festivity —to-morrow must see you in the field—I have appointed you to command the expedition against the rebel negroes. Here are your instructions —Captain Malcolm, yours.
1 Plant. And, brave Captain, shew no mercy.
Clift. Sir!
1 Plant. Why, they shew no mercy to us Christians.
Clift. That is the very reason, if we are Christians, that we should shew mercy to them.
Gov. But where is the bride?
Clift. The church's rites are performed, and the slaves have made a festival; I think I hear their music. My Zelinda comes!
                                         (An Indian Procession—At the end of which, Zelinda is brought on, upon Slaves' shoulders—others dancing round her. She descends, and embraces Clifton). Clift. [175]   I present my bride to your Excellency.
Gov. A most interesting creature!
Zel. Oh, my husband! this great, this unmerited blessing! thanks, dear countrymen!
[Page 26]
thanks, fellow slaves! All that remains is to drink from the calabash of mutual love. Give me the cup—Who has prepared it?
(Gambia slowly advances). Gam. It is here. (Eyeing Clifton with fierceness).
Zel. Gambia! how terrible he looks! Alas, I dare not drink—I fear.
Clift. Ah, 'tis poison!
Gam. Poison to Zelinda, and by Gambia's hand! (Falls on his knees) God of my fathers, hear me—If one thought of ill to her dwell here, change this balmy juice indeed to poison! May withering torments blast my youthful strength, and may my wandering spirit ne'er find those bowers of bliss, which for the wretched slave, kind mercy has prepared. (Drinks from the Goblet, then rises).
Zel. Gambia, forgive me! Alas, how I have wronged you—But, oh! one blessing for my husband!
(Gambia dashes the Calabash on the ground, and rushes out—A musket is fired). Enter an Officer. Off. General, be on your guard—The rebel force advances—they threaten this plantation.
Gov. That must be prevented—Captain [200]   Malcolm, advance with your marines—                                          [Exit Malcolm. —Arm the faithful slaves.
                                         [Exeunt Slaves. Gov. Where's Gambia?
Clift. Doubtless, he has joined the rebels.

[Page 27]
Enter Gambia . Gam. Who calls for Gambia?
Gov. You see, Clifton, you are mistaken.
Clift. 'Tis fit he be secured.
Gam. Secured!
Gov. No, I will trust him—give him a sword. (Takes one from Aid-de-Camp).
Gam. You have found the way to secure Gambia.
Enter Somerdyke . Som. The foe's at hand; they have fired the plantation—Beware of ambush.
Gov. Clifton, expect your succour instantly —follow me.
[Exeunt Governor, Gambia, Somerdyke, and Attendants. Clift. Retire, dearest Zelinda.
Zel. Let me but share your danger—
Clift. No, no—thy presence would unman me—Go, go—'tis too late.
                                         (During this, rebel Negroes have peeped from the Canes—they steal out, and suddenly attack Clifton, who retreats, combating them. Zelinda shrieks, and falls). Enter Gambia . Gam. What shriek was that? What do I see?—my hated rival in the rebels' power— strike home—they have him down, they bear him away—now I'm revenged!
Zel. Oh! mercy! mercy!
Gam. [225]   That voice!
Zel. Is there no pity for a wretched wife?
Gam. It is that voice that never called in
[Page 28]
vain! Yes, proud Briton, thou shalt feel, and own my power!
                                         [Exit. Zel. Ah! Gambia rushes on him!—No, he battles on his side!—he preserves him!
Gambia enters, bearing in Clifton . Gam. There—there is the man you love! (Giving Clifton in her arms).
Zel. Generous, beloved Gambia! Look up, dearest Clifton, and with me bless your deliverer!
Clift. African! not for my life preserved, but in atonement for the wrongs I did your noble nature, behold me bend before thee.
Gam. Ah! my proud rival, have I brought you there? Why, this is noble vengeance. Pray, Sir, rise—Zelinda, thy hand—One sigh for expiring hope—one tear to the memory of my love—'tis past—there! (He joins their hands). And, happy Briton, love her as well as I have done, and my Zelinda's—your Zelinda's virtues will be rewarded!
Enter Somerdyke and Slaves, armed. Som. Their numbers increase: their fury is directed against the slaves of this plantation, for their fidelity to their mistress.
Gam. Perhaps I may thwart their vengeance. [250]   Then return, and watch thy safety.
Zel. Oh, Gambia, think of Clifton—should he fall—
Gam. Take comfort; he will not—at least of this be certain, alone he shall not fall.
                                         [Exit. Malc. Heave a-head, my hearts! [Enters with Marines.] —Here make your stand—here's the danger.

[Page 29]
(Soldiers rush on, and armed Slaves). [Drum beats.] Clift. Advance, and clear the canes of those that ambush there. There's the road—I know you'll follow, when your Captain tells you it leads to victory.
Zel. Or to death. (Sighs).
FINALE. Zelinda.
Ah! If in this dread hour of sorrow,
   Should thy glory set in night; Clifton and Stella.
Heaven may grant a kind to-morrow,
   Warm with hope, with pleasure bright. Malcolm and Chorus.
Now, ye brave, let us on,—your vengeance bestow,—
   Those dastards in ambush confounding!
   The war-cry of England resounding,
Triumph to freedom! and death to every foe!
[Page 30]
ACT II. SCENE I. A Sea-port in Surinam.—One side of the Stage occupied by Habitations of Wood, with striped Verandas.—Muslin Shades in lieu of Glass.—Orange Trees in fruit before the Doors.—On the other side a Fortification, Flag-staff, &c. backed by the view of a Bay. Enter Attendants bearing Luggage, followed by Lindenburg . Lind. So, once more at home—Well, Sir?
Enter Servant. Serv. Mrs. Lindenburg is inform'd of her son's arrival, and hastens here to meet him.
Lind. I will wait her coming. Proceed with the baggage.                                          [Exeunt Attendants. —After years of absence, welcome the new world, where, under my real name of Lindenburg, I hope to conceal the vices of the Chevalier Alkmar, which expelled me from the old. Is that my mother? Let me rejoice that the returned prodigal has virtue enough to feel the throb of affection at beholding the author of his being.
Enter Mrs. Lindenburg . Mrs. L. My dearest Lindenburg!
Lind. My honour'd mother!

[Page 31]
Mrs. L. My long-lost, my beloved son, what anxieties have I not suffer'd—my letters unanswered—unwelcome reports—
Lind. Come, come, the bright hour that unites us, must not be clouded with the melancholy shadows of the past.
Mrs. L. True, my son; and your arrival today will give gladness to more than a fond mother, who has a favour to solicit.
Lind. [25]   Rather say, Madam, who has a command to honour me with.
Mrs. L. Best of sons! 'tis the emancipation of a female slave and her child.
Lind. Is the document ready? I'll sign it instantly.
Mrs. L. It shall be prepared. 'Tis a romantic circumstance, for her husband is an Officer in the English army—a Captain Clifton.
Lind. (Falling into his arms) Clifton!
Mrs. L. You start! you are agitated!
Lind. No, no—only the name is familiar to me—Precious mischief! (Aside).
Mrs. L. The money he had provided for purchasing her freedom, he was plundered of, by one Chevalier Alkmar—
Lind. (Falling into his arms) So, so, all is known—
Mrs. L. Who made insolent pretensions to his sister's hand, and drew on himself the chastisement of Clifton—Do you know the lovely Stella?
Lind. I have seen her, and certainly think her handsome—Now, proud beauty, 'tis my turn to tyrannize. (Aside).
Mrs. L. Come then, and give freedom to [50]   poor Zelinda.
Lind. Hold! would it not grace the gift, if
[Page 32]
the parties were present?—Suppose you prepare a little festival on the occasion.
Mrs. L. My dear son, this is worthy of you —I'll about it instantly—Happy, happy mother!
                                         [Exit. Lind. The wife and child of the hated Clifton, my slaves! Why, this is perfect vengeance! Fortune, I now acquit thee: thou owest me nothing. But hold—if I meet Clifton, my assumed name of Alkmar, the foul disgrace that fell on me, when this faithless arm betrayed its master, will fill the public ear, will rend a mother's heart. Could I perfect my revenge, and yet conceal my shame! Ay, but how?
Enter Somerdyke . Som. Noble Sir, welcome to Surinam!
Lind. Ah! my agent, Somerdyke—
Som. Most faithfully so.
Lind. I hope then, the balances due to me are ready to be produced?
Som. I can't say they are. You must know, Sir, I am a man of a sweet disposition.
Lind. Indeed!
Som. And when people ask me to lend them money at fifteen or twenty per cent. I somehow [75]   have not the heart to refuse them.
Lind. Kind soul!
Som. Here's a list of bonds extorted from my good nature, and I hope you'll wait till some are paid— (Giving Paper).
Lind. Scoundrel! (Aside, and looking over Paper) Here is one, I see, that may be put to the credit of your sweet disposition—five hundred dollars lent to that prodigal Sharpset.

[Page 33]
Som. An amiable weakness; but I have a counter security—Captain Clifton's.
Lind. (Falling into his arms) Indeed, my worthy fellow! I'm very glad you've been so prudent— You say the money due to me is not ready.
Som. Alas!
Lind. Then arrest Clifton on that bond, and name your own time for clearing your account.
Som. It shall be done—I declare you're just such a good-natur'd soul as myself—I'll about it directly.
Lind. Who come here? By my wrongs, 'tis Clifton's disdainful sister, and with her—
Som. Oh, that's the pretty slave the Captain has married.
Lind. Indeed! Ay, my slave—mine. Faith, [100]   she has tempting charms. Give her freedom! not for Peru's best mine. This way!
                                         [Exeunt. Enter Stella and Zelinda . Zel. Alas, he comes not! Pitying Heaven, give me my warrior back to these arms! Hark! I thought I heard the beat of the distant drum! No, 'twas but my throbbing heart—Pity me, lady!
Stella. Now, there's the advantage of being a wife—she can make a public demand upon sympathy, and vent her woes in a fine audible voice; while I, a poor maiden, must gulp down my sighs, and dare not cry “Ah me,” for my poor sailor! But after all, a soldier's wife has to share many dangers and heart-aches—but she also shares her warrior's triumph and renown.
SONG— Stella .

   The village maid sighs
   When a red coat she spies,
Beholding the march of a Soldier.
[Page 34]


   But, ah, lack-a-day!
   Soon he marches away,
Then, who'd fall in love with a Soldier?

   But, in helmet so gay,
   Should he whispering say,
“My girl, can you fancy a Soldier?

   The heart of the brave
[125]      Will never deceive;”
Who'd not fall in love with a Soldier?

   From the cold flinty bed
   That pillows his head,
At the drum's double beat, starts the Soldier!

   He regards not your sighs,
   When glory's the prize,
Then, who'd be the wife of a Soldier?

   But the fierce battle done,
   The triumph begun,
When peace crowns with laurel your Soldier!

   When, free from alarms,
   You rush into his arms,
Who'd not be the wife of a Soldier?                                          [Exit. [A distant March is played.] Enter the Governor, Officers, and Planters—On the other side, enter the Troops, headed by Clifton —disarmed Negroes follow. Gov. Gallant Captain, I congratulate you on the triumphant success of your expedition.
Clift. Please your Excellency, the sword achieved much, but clemency more; for, on the offer of mercy—a word, alas! to them scarce known —the revolted negroes returned to their duty.
Gov. The thanks of the Colony are due to all engaged; but chiefly to you, Captain Clifton.
Clift. Sir, if thanks must accompany desert, let them be bestowed on the most worthy: Gambia!
[Page 35]
Gambia! I say! Quick to deserve, but [150]   slow to receive reward. Gambia, stand forth! (Gambia advances from behind). —To the enterprise, valour, and persuasion of this slave, are you chiefly indebted for this day's triumph and security.
Gov. He shall be rewarded.
Clift. Yes, my Zelinda, but for Gambia's protecting arm, thou would'st this day have pressed thy husband's bloody bier.
Gov. Captain Clifton, your promotion shall be my immediate care; but I have obtained from the Council a privilege, which will be dear to your heart—In manifestation of their gratitude, they allow you to emancipate a slave.
[ Zelinda runs to Clifton .] Gam. Precious boon! Now Zelinda, thou wilt be happy!
Clift. Best beloved!—Can I forego the blessing of giving freedom to a wife?—Can I forego the claims of honor, gratitude, and justice?—They must be satisfied.
                                         (Secretary advances with parchment and inkstand). Gov. Please to write here, the name of the slave you emancipate.
Clift. Give me the paper—'tis a trying contest, —pardon me, dearest inmate of my heart!— (Writes) Look, dearest Zelinda!
Zel. 'Tis noble!—'tis just!
Clift. [175]   Take it to the Governor.
Gov. “Captain Clifton demands the freedom of—Gambia!”
Gam. (Electrified at his name being pronounced, becomes violently agitated) —Free! a man! let me control this strong emotion! it will
[Page 36]
not be!—thou open, liberal air!—thou teeming, bounteous earth!—thou interminable expanse of heaven!—thou spontaneous wilderness of nature! —thou art mine! all, all are mine! for I am nature's free-born child!—Liberty! give me the language of gods, to tell that I am free! the tongues of angels, to pour forth the gratitude of a heart, swelling with its dignities! bursting with its joys! alas! I am unfit for thanks or converse! a few moments, spare me—Generous Briton! prophetic be my tongue! when thro' thy country's zeal, the all searching sun shall dart his rays in vain, to find a slave in Afric—Zelinda, bid me bleed, die for thee, write but on my tomb, that Gambia died free!
                                         [Exit. Gov. Clifton, farewell; this sacrifice of the endearing ties of husband, and of father, at the shrine of gratitude, excites my admiration and my envy.
Clift. I hope, Sir, I have done my duty; and [200]   see, my Zelinda smiles approval of the deed.
Gov. Oh, my friends!—'tis not by the thunder of the war, but by the still voice of conscience, that the liberty of mankind will be achieved—yes, slavery must fall before the Christian warrior;— the arena he combats in, is the human mind; Revelation unfolds his banner;—Truth forges his shield;—his armour is rivetted by Reason, and his lance is tempered by Mercy.
                                         [Exeunt Governor and Attendants. Enter Malcolm . Malc. Joy! my friend!—Lindenburg's return'd, and has promised emancipation to Zelinda. Hasten then, to Mrs. Lindenburg, and share in the joys of a happy mother.

[Page 37]
Clift. Farewell!—I leave you, love, with a heart elated with the brightest hopes, and cheer'd by its own approbation.
                                         [Exit. Malc. To the blessings that await you, let me add the gratulations of sincere and respectful friendship.
DUET— Zelinda, and Malcolm . Malc.
In joyful peace, disarming,
With hope thy bosom warming,
   My friendship deign to prove. Zel.
Ah! language vain expressing
The pure, and heavenly blessing
   That sanctions my fond love! Malc.
[225]   Joys now abounding, Zel.
Friends here surrounding, Both.
   On high the Song we pour:
Friendship your/our hands uniting,
Love, to his bower inviting:
   Ah! what can heav'n give more?                                          [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Mangrove Tree. Enter Clifton . Clift. There dwells the best of women, who has promised happiness to the loveliest. You rich, I envy not your wealth, for I shall possess Zelinda, my honour, and my sword; and the soldier's sword, while it gives immortality to the hero, bestows on the humblest, respect and competence. Yes, my sword, dear art thou to my heart; for memory treasures that proud day, when, in Belgia's plain, I unsheathed thee by the side of England's bravest hero.

[Page 38]
RECITATIVE— Clifton .
Deeds of the brave, inspire a noble strain,
I draw my theme from Belgia's fertile plain;
Where, from proud Conquest, gentle Peace arose,
And to the warring world gave lasting, sweet repose. SONG.

E'er Vict'ry did her wreath impart,
   That broke the tyrant's yoke,
The words still vibrate on the heart,
   Our noblest Captain spoke!

Basely to fly from Gallia's sword,
   Ah! what would England say?
“Up, Lads, and at them!”—was the word
   That bravely won the day.

On wings of fate the bullets fly,
   Our comrades sink in death!—
[25]   Yet nobly join the battle cry,
   With their expiring breath.

Basely to fly from Gallia's sword,
   Ah! what would England say?
“Up, Lads, and at them!”—was the word
   That bravely won the day. Enter Provost and Attendants. Prov. Stay, Sir!—
Clift. At whose command?
Prov. That of the law.—Captain Clifton, you are my prisoner—Here, Sir, is my authority.
Clift. Unfortunate reverse! a prisoner at this anxious moment! Enter Zelinda . —Well, conduct me to your prison!
Zel. To prison!

[Page 39]
Clift. Even so, my Zelinda! adieu! seek Mrs. Lindenburg—tell her—
Zel. Oh! Clifton! do not let them part us.
Prov. Sir, I attend you!
Zel. Mercy! support me! (Faints).
Clift. But a few moments spare me! Must I leave her in the icy arms of death? Is there no friend? Gambia, where art thou?
( Gambia without). Gam. My benefactor's voice! Enters. What do I see? Zelinda! explain.
Prov. The gentleman going to prison for 500 [50]   dollars, that's all.
Gam. A prison!—What, captivity to the giver of freedom!—Is, then, a dungeon the temple of a soldier's triumph?
Clift. Gambia, I commit to thy care my heart's best treasure—Farewell, African, thou art free— prove thyself worthy of the blessing.
                                         [Exeunt Clifton and Officers. Gam. I will do so—she recovers—Zelinda!
Zel. Who calls?
Gam. Zelinda!
Zel. No, that's not the voice that speaks comfort here—Where is he? gone!
Gam. Be composed.
Zel. Oh, Gambia, restore him to me.
Gam. Would that I could! would that the sacrifice of life,—nay, more, of liberty—of liberty!— ah! light dawns!—hope revives!—Zelinda, I will restore thy husband. Hush these convulsive sighs, that rend my heart; waste not those precious tears, that now unman me—but hasten to the prison—I will soon follow, and bring—

[Page 40]
Zel. Alas! I despair—
Gam. Despair!—Does not Gambia live?— Does not Gambia love?
                                         [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. The Interior of a Prison. Enter Sharpset and Jailer. Jail. So, we've got you here at last.—What, not one oily word?
Sharp. Humph!
Jail. Not one beseeching bow? (Sharpset erects his head.) Oh, if you like silence and solitude, I'll take care you shall have plenty on't,—there! (Places a Chair).
                                         [Exit, locking Gate. Sharp. Heigho!—Now then, fortune has done her worst—and is this her worst?—Pooh!—Is this what I dreaded?—Why, 'tis delightful, 'tis luxury!—In this shady blest retreat, there's no dodging and skulking from rascals I despise—no more cringing and grinning, till my back and jaws ache; and as to matrimony—what, plunge into purgatory to avoid this paradise!—Here I can laugh, sing, tol de rol de rol—To be sure, singing, without an audience to appreciate my vocal powers, is but poor dull work; and as for laughing, egad if I do, it must be at my own jokes, ha! ha! ha! ha!—Ho! (Sighs) How calm every thing is—very calm—particularly calm—amazingly calm —infernally calm—so calm, that the most hideous crash of a typhon, or the fiercest tornado of ladies' tongues, would be heaven to it—I say, how do you do—somebody—holloa! you any body— [25]   zounds, will nobody answer? I shall lose my
[Page 41]
senses—I shall lose my voice— (bawling) Oh, that the dearest friend— ( Clifton and Jailer enter, unperceived by Sharpset. —Clifton throws himself into a Chair.) I had in the world, was seated in that chair—I would rush into his arms—I would— (Seeing Clifton) —Eh, what, Clifton! my dearest, kindest— now this early visit is real friendship—and so my misfortunes have brought you here?—
Clift. They have indeed! (Sighs.)
Sharp. Well, don't be cast down on my account, my fine fellow—you see I an't—I hope your stay with me won't be short.
Clift. Thank you! (rises.)
Sharp. You are fidgetty—I'm afraid you are going away soon!—
Clift. You need not fear that.
Sharp. You make me happy by saying so.— And so you're married—Come, sit down, sit down, and tell me all about it—don't hurry yourself, my dear boy!—I'll hear you talk for ten hours, with pleasure.
(Noise of Outer-gate unbarred). (Zelinda without). Zel. Admit me instantly!
Clift. My wife's voice!
Sharp. Your wife!—What, she come to see me too?—upon my soul this is too much—it [50]   really distresses me! dear sympathizing angel!
Enter Zelinda and Jailer. ( Sharpset bows and smiles). Zel. My Clifton! I come to share thy captivity.
Sharp. Cap-ti-ti-ti-vity—his! Clifton's!—I
[Page 42]
dread to ask, and yet I must know— (To Jailer) What scoundrel brought that noble fellow here?
Jail. Why, if you must know the scoundrel's name, 'tis Sharpset.
Sharp. Oh, how welcome would a halter be!
Jail. And to mend the matter, his being a prisoner, prevents his wife from getting her freedom.
Sharp. Fool! idiot! villain!—aye, that's the word—unfeeling villain!—Clifton!— (Clifton holds out his hand). Don't forgive me—that would kill me.—Ass! accomplished, most incomparable ass!—insensible to feeling, deaf to honor, even blind to interest— Heavens, how have I neglected that angel, Miss Von Frump!—Oh, could I but now breathe into those ears with diamond bobs, my ardent vows— sigh on that bosom that heaves with fourteen rows of orient pearl!—claiming the fulfilment of this promise, which with a lover's ardour I kiss!—Oh, thou Dutch Venus!
(Gambia without). Gam. Unbar your gates, open them wide, to receive the messenger of joy! the dispenser of liberty! the herald of Zelinda's happiness.
Zel. [75]   'Tis Gambia's voice! he has fulfill'd his promise, and my husband will be free.
Sharp. Will he? then that clears both—so, out we'll march together, and at the altar of restored liberty, I'll just make free to sacrifice Miss Von Frump's marriage promise!— (He is about to tear it).
Jail. Hold! that's your road. (Pointing to interior of Prison). There are plenty of detainers against you.
Sharp. The devil there are!—Heigho! well, I alone shall suffer—there's comfort in that. Clifton
[Page 43]
will be happy with the woman of his heart; and so should I be with her I love, if the divine Miss Von Frump were here! Oh, how I adore her!—
                                         [Exit, kissing the Paper. Jailer opens the door for Gambia, and Exit. Enter Gambia . Clift. Speak, Gambia! what meant your words?
Gam. Let it suffice—a friend who wishes his name should be concealed, has discharged your bond. Said I not, Zelinda, I would restore thy husband? said I not, Briton, I would not die thy debtor?—When the clock strikes one, your prison doors will be opened.
Zel. Happy hour! do you not long for the welcome sound?
Gam. It will soon be here, Zelinda.
Zel. [100]   Blessed liberty!
Gam. Aye, blessed liberty! (Sighs heavily).
Clift. You sigh—There is some mystery.
(Bell strikes one). Zel. The welcome bell! then Clifton is free!
Gam. And Gambia's fate's accomplished!
Enter Jailer and Somerdyke , who gives a Paper to Jailer. Jail. Captain Clifton, you are at liberty!
                                         [Exit. Clift. Blessings on my unknown preserver! and thanks to you, my worthy friend.—Come with us to Colonel Lindenburg's, to witness the consummation of my happiness; and, as we pass along,
[Page 44]
Zelinda, who never asks in vain, shall obtain from Gambia, the secret of my liberation.
Zel. Come, Gambia!
Gam. I'll—I'll follow—I have business with that man, which may detain—
Som. Well, that's all settled, so come along, slave.
Gam. Hush! Go, dear Zelinda.
Clift. Slave!
Som. Yes, Slave—what do you stare at? He sold himself dear enough.
Clift. Sold himself! horror! self-sacrificed for me! It shall not be, Sir. I am still a prisoner.
Som. I know nothing about that; 'tis enough [125]   for me to know, I have bought him for Colonel Lindenburg, so come along!
Zel. Gambia, this cruel kindness—
Gam. Nay, if Zelinda frown on me—
Som. A fellow that puts so little value on freedom, deserves to lose it.
Gam. Not value it! has it not bestowed on me the god like power of restoring a virtuous man to happiness? has it not gifted me with the angelic privilege of lifting up the heart of suffering woman? Farewell! the debt of gratitude is fully paid, and now, Sir, with all duty, your slave obeys you.
                                         [Exit with Somerdyke. Clift. Amazed, oppressed, what shall I say— how act? Oh, I were unworthy the name of man, did I suffer this generous sacrifice! And is that the being with whom the proud European denies fellowship? if we are not brothers, let the white man blush that he is alien to the blood that mantles in that noble breast.
                                         [Exeunt.
[Page 45]
SCENE IV. Enter Miss Von Frump . Miss V. F. What a fuss Mrs. Lindenburg is making about this Zelinda! Well, I shall soon give a fête, sacred so wedded love! But where's Mr. Sharpset to claim my hand? Sure, the fellow don't mean to disappoint me—disappoint me, indeed! it will be a happy escape a very joyful circumstance! Oh, there's my nephew, and his civil friend; perhaps he would have me—let me endeavour to appear as happy as I really am.
Enter Fogrum , and Sam Sharpset . Fog. Now, mind, we go halves in her fortune. Swagger to her about lords—pretend to know them.
Sam S. Pretend! why, bless you, at York races, I am in the cabinet.
Fog. Mind—halves!
Miss V. F. Well, nephew, have you been looking out a tomb for me?
Fog. No, dear aunt, but I've been looking out a husband for you—my dear York, you're wanted.
Sam S. I own I wish to transplant this fine blooming aloe into my native plains at the top of Black Hamilton—a grand tip-top cool place, Madam— there I would introduce you to Lord Rubbish, [25]   Viscount Gumshun, Earl of Rattletraps, and—
Miss V. F. I suppose your great men have abundance of slaves?

[Page 46]
Sam S. Oh, plenty—the wretches, with us are called toad-eaters.
Miss V. F. And do your noblemen follow business, attend the markets?
Sam S. Oh, yes, there's a New Market made on purpose for them: they all deal in summut—as coals, pictures, lead, parliament men, brimstone, and such like. Why, some of them are so fond of turning the honest penny, that they have been known to sell their voices.
Miss V. F. Well, I should not object to be acquainted with lords, provided they are not gentlemen.
Sam S. Oh, that may be managed, I assure you.
Fog. Oh, aunt! can you look at him, and refuse?
Miss V. F. Alas! my assent is of no avail— there's an obstacle.
Fog. An obstacle!
Miss V. F. Yes, a marriage promise given to his brother—till that is restor'd, I cannot form another alliance.
Sam S. Oh, Matty, thou'rt a double-faced rogue!
Fog. Yes, smoothing me with praising my great [50]   sense, brilliant wit—
Sam S. Yes, all opposite to the truth.
Fog. And talked of your beauty!
Sam S. Yes, damn it, that's his cunning—he speaks truth sometimes, the better to hum folk after.
Enter Slave, who delivers a Letter to Sam Sharpset . Sam S. 'Tis from Matty—let me see—it bea'nt grammared quite properly, but I'll tell you the contents
[Page 47]
—“From the Castle—State Apartments”— How grand!—“beg to see you—bring your friend, Mr. Fogrum—my object is to provide for you both here,”—that is, in the state apartments. We'll go. and in our turns just wheedle master Matty a-bit.
Fog. And if we bring back the promise—then you'll consent.
Miss V. F. Why, if your friend proves himself so skilful a negociator as to produce that important document, he shall then see my ultimatum.
Fog. No, shall he tho'!—If you can produce the important document, she says you shall see her ultimatum.
Sam S. Why, that's plump, or the devil's in't!
Fog. Then, hey for the wedding, and hey for London!
Sam S. [75]   That's it!—I, like a fool, must travel to see wonders, when, I'll maintain, there's more wonders to be seen in London, than in all the world besides.
Fog. So there is; I can sing a song about that, and I flatter myself indifferently well— (attempts to sing) —York, you're wanted!
SONG— Sam Sharpset.

The World's Seven Wonders, every child doth know,
   Fal de ral, &c.
They're very well to read of, but I'm prepar'd to show,
If for wonders you seek, to London you must go,
   With a heigho!—
   I'll prove it so. Fal de ral, &c.

King Solomon's Temple had pillars made of brass,
   Fal de ral, &c.
But surely our Temples of Lawyers surpass,
For there's brass enough there to prove Solomon an ass,
   With a heigho!—
   Quid pro quo. Fal de ral, &c.
[Page 48]


The Antipodes who dwell the other side the ball,
   Fal de ral, &c.
Wear their heads below—but Saint Stephen's, on a call,
Can shew you many a great man without any head at all!
   With a heigho!—
   Is it Aye or No? Fal de ral, &c.

[100]   The Medicean Venus of beauty was the queen,
   Fal de ral, &c.
But our Venuses of London excel her in mien,
With their alablaster skins—and there's plenty to be seen!
   With a heigho!—
   What a pretty show! Fal de ral, &c.

The Nile may o'erflow, and its muddy banks may drown,
   Fal de ral, &c.
But our honour, our faith, our commercial renown,
Will hold firm the Bank of famous London town,
   With a heigho!
   Henry Hase and Co. Fal de ral, &c.

Your fine ancient heroes, the javelin they hurl'd,
   Fal de ral, &c.
But our Tars, and our Soldiers, our flag being unfurl'd,
Made Europe confess them—the Wonders of the World !
   With a heigho!—
   I'll be d---d but 'tis so. Fal de ral, &c. SCENE V. The Pleasure Ground, with Pavilion, &c. Enter Governor, leading Mrs. Lindenburg—Clifton , leading in Zelinda and Child. Mrs. L. At length the welcome hour is come, when I can reward the virtues of Zelinda. Here
[Page 49]
is the paper, Sir, that gives her freedom, wanting only my son's signature and your Excellency's seal. (Giving paper).
Gov. You impose, Madam, a welcome duty. This writing is in nature's fairest character, and Heaven itself will be an approving witness of the deed.
Mrs. L. Captain Clifton, my son heard with grief of your arrest, and will experience a pleasing surprise in seeing you here. I expect his barge every moment.—Retire into this pavilion, where refreshments wait you.—Will your Excellency please to enter.
(All retire). (The Barge floats in—from it lands Colonel Lindenburg, Somerdyke , and Slaves). Lind. So!—great festive preparations—but I shall mar their revelry. My dear mother, I deeply regret the law of Surinam will not allow me to give freedom to your favorite slave.
Mrs. L. My son!
Lind. You know, Madam, the act is invalid— her husband not being present.
Mrs. L. Oh, that difficulty I will instantly remove — (beckons).
Enter Governor, Clifton , Child, and Attendants. Lind. [25]   Confusion! how is this—Clifton at liberty! —Well, be it so, still vengeance shall have its due.
Mrs. L. I present to your Excellency Colonel Lindenburg. (Governor bows, and gives him the paper). —Captain Clifton, this is—
Clift. Amazement!—the Chevalier Alkmar!

[Page 50]
Mrs. L. No, no, 'tis my son Lindenburg!— why this surprise—that look of horror?
Lind. Peace, good mother. Whether the Chevalier Alkmar, or Colonel Lindenburg, this at least seems certain, that the dear wife of Captain Clifton's bosom, and the heir of all his honours, are my slaves—the creatures of my will— the drudges of my wants—the minions of my pleasures!
Clift. Never! (Draws his Sword).
Mrs. L. Hold! my son, explain.
Lind. Madam, you know not the cruel wrongs I've suffered—Please to retire—
Mrs. L. Willingly!—Lindenburg, when you have proved yourself the inheritor of your father's honour, ask your mother for her blessing till then, farewell!
                                         [Exit. Lind. My Lord Governor, I demand possession [50]   of my property: they are mine by law, which law you are bound by oath to maintain.
Gov. Alas, too well I know the law—I think, Sir, that without your protecting tutelage, I know my duty. Clifton, sheath your sword. You must submit; my heart bleeds for you, my friend; but outrage would justify oppression.
Lind. Bring out their chains, and drive them to my estate.
Boy. My father, save me!
Zel. Oh, my husband!
Gov. Clifton you are agitated—I am collected —mild persuasion may do much— (Apart to Lindenburg,) Col. Lindenburg, you are a damned unfeeling scoundrel— (with violent irritation)
Lind. Indeed! shall I applaud your wisdom, most sapient Governor, for condemning without hearing, or your courage, for insulting, when your situation secures you from chastisement?
Gov. Chastisement! (half draws his Sword).

[Page 51]
Lind. Is your blade hot—that you air it thus?
Gov. No—I was merely playing with it—Wheu! 'Tis very warm!
Lind. I'm quite cool—
Gov. [75]   'Sdeath and hell, Sir, did not you at play, rob him of the very money that would have redeemed his wife and child?
Lind. Robbed him!
Gov. I mean, he was irritated and impetuous —you collected—and that gave you the best of the game.
Lind. As it does now—
Gov. True!—He! he! (endeavouring to laugh) I wish you would sell me those slaves—I'll bid handsomely—I'm not very rich—
Lind. I am—that's my answer.
Gov. He! he! Damn him!
                                         [Exit furiously. Lind. Their chains, I say!
(Gambia appears on the Barge, holding them up). Gam. They are here— (advances).
Zel. Gambia! then there is hope, my husband.
Gam. These fetters are too large—the forger of these bonds thought they were to controul manly vigour— the fool was ignorant they might be required for female softness, and helpless infancy.
Lind. See you secure them, or your life—
(Enter Slaves). Gam. Fear not, honoured master! at my life's peril I will secure their safety.
(Lindenburg tears the Paper).
[Page 52]
FINALE— Somerdyke, and Chorus of Slaves.
Strike the oar—your doom obey—
[100]   Slave devoted—come away!
Who shall conquer him, whose hate
Urges on thy destin'd fate? Zelinda.
Lo! behold this infant bends,
To Mercy's seat his pray'r ascends! Clifton.
Awful vengeance will decree
The doom of hated tyranny. Chorus.
Strike the oar, &c. ACT III. SCENE I. The Interior of the Prison— Sharpset discovered. Enter Jailer. Sharp. Heigho! Jailer, has any body called?
Jail. No.
Sharp. Oh, dear me! not even one of my creditors?
Jail. No.
Sharp. What, they desert me too! I shall die—Oh, Miss Von Frump, wert thou here! but, who could ever coax Cupid into a jail? No, he hates a bailiff, for captivating more than he can; and would sooner lend you a halter, to suspend you in the air, than his wings to fly thro' it. If brother Sammy and his
[Page 53]
friend would come, and could I persuade them that this prison was the Stadthouse, the Castle, and that rascal, the governor of it, I might escape, and, by virtue of this promise, marry the divine Miss Von Frump. Egad, I'll try —Oh, mother, Necessity, teem with twins of invention, and with their god-papas, Bronze and Cajoling, aid thy votary. Come here, my honest fellow.
Jail. Eh!
Sharp. Come here, you sly rogue.
Jail. Oh!
Sharp. [25]   Do you know, when I contemplate your figure, appreciate your politeness, and bend to your authority, I can't bear to call you jailer.
Jail. Nor I, you jail-bird.
Sharp. Thank you.
Jail. But can it be helped?
Sharp. Why, in high-bred accomplished jails, the chief, that's you, is called Governor —you are Governor, for here you govern every thing.
Jail. Yes—except when my wife's at home.
Sharp. Of course she's governante, and generally ranks above the governor—I shall always call you Governor.
Jail. With all my heart.
Sharp. Damn that little Dutch hat! (aside). Do you know, Governor, that our governors always wear such hats as these. Put it on, Governor (giving Hat) —The sight of those keys will ruin all (Aside).
Jail. I can't get it on.
Sharp. How the devil should you, with that bunch of keys in your hand! put them in your pocket, Governor—your fee-pocket—that's the
[Page 54]
[50]   largest—aye, now with my pipe in your hand, you look something like a Governor (giving him his Pipe).
(Sam Sharpset, without). Sam S. What, more locks?
Sharp. Here they are—'Tis my brother and his friend—rich as mines!—if they would be responsible for me, what a thumping fee you would have, Governor!
Jail. I wish they would then.
Enter Fogrum and Sam Sharpset . Sharp. My dear Sammy, I sent for you to this castle—
Sam S. Yes, I know, but you are very difficult to get at.
Sharp. Did you ever know a great man that was not?
Fog. And you were not quite faithful to your promise?
Sharp. Did you ever know a great man that was? I did promise to reconcile you to your aunt; but, upon my honour, I could not come, could I, Governor?
Jail. Oh! no.
Sharp. Ten thousand pardons— (introducing them) —The Governor of this place—my brother, my friend; and, should I succeed in placing them here, you would, I am sure, take [75]   the greatest care of them, Governor (they all bow) —You are looking at these state apartments —very substantial.
Sam S. Very.
Sharp. These places are always built massive to prevent improper people from getting in.
Sam S. Indeed! now I have heard of places
[Page 55]
that are built massive, to prevent improper people from getting out.
Sharp. Very likely. I shall not dispute your superior information on that subject, my dear Sammy— (Aside) I hope he don't suspect.
Sam S. Fogrum). Come, let's get the promise from him. You break the ice.
Fog. I will—we'll do him—He! he!—upon my honour, we are a couple of shocking fellows; but we can't help it—you must know, Sir, he! he! he!—my aunt, Sir—he! he! he!
Sharp. Sir!
Fog. York, you're wanted.
Sam S. Why, the long and the short on't is, that Miss Von Frump has looked me over, found nothing much amiss as to shape and action, I believe, and has consented to become Mrs. Samuel Sharpset, Esq.
Sharp. [100]   The devil she has! (Aside). —'Tis a pretty plot, but if I don't find a prettier— Sammy, I give you joy!
Fog. Ah! there's brotherly love!
Sharp. With me, Sir, that's every thing— From my heart I give you joy!
Sam S. Could not you give me that promise that Miss Von Frump sent you, out of a bit of fun?
Sharp. Out of a bit of fun! Yes, so she did— You shall have it, my dear Sammy—here it is (Taking out Papers). Take it, my brother, and may Hymen—No, this is not it—this is a receipt for blanching the faces of the negroes, making black appear white—I find it very useful; it was given me by a celebrated lawyer. This is not it—'Pshaw! now I recollect, 'tis in my strong box at home, and here's the key. (Sam going to take it, he prevents him).

[Page 56]
Fog. What, not trust your own dear brother?
Sharp. Sir, do you wish to see my head lie there, and my body there?
Fog. Lud a' mercy, Sir!
Sharp. It would be the case, did any one open it but myself—State secrets, Sir!—besides, the paper is bundled up with property of mine, [125]   that I defy any man in the Settlement to find.
Sam S. Well, go and bring it then.
Sharp. Yes, 'tis soon said—go and bring it —But, alas! I'm of such importance to the State, (painful pre-eminence!) so jealous are they—
Fog. I see—they are afraid you should give them the slip.
Sharp. You have hit it exactly. I should not wonder if the Governor had orders to prevent my leaving this palace. (Raising his voice). Tho', perhaps, if you would take my place till my return—
Fog., Sam S. With the greatest pleasure.
Sharp. They will take my place with the greatest pleasure. I shall come back immediately.
Fog. I'll be bound for you, you will.
Sharp. He says he'll be bound for me. The fact is, the Governor fears he might be a sufferer, but he would not.
Sam S. That he would not, I'll answer for it.
Sharp. He says he'll answer for it. You see, Governor, my object in going is a brother's happiness, not my own.— (Aside to Jailer) [150]   What a thumping fee you'll have!
Jail. Oh! go by all means.
Fog., Sam S. Yes, go along.

[Page 57]
Sharp. Is not it very sultry to-day?
Sam S. Come, Matty, don't be so grand and lazy.
Fog. How unwilling he is to turn out!
Sharp. Great men frequently are.
Jail. Come, you shall go.
Sharp. Well, if you all insist—Perhaps, Sir, (To Fogrum) you may blame me when I'm gone.
Fog. Pray don't be unhappy about that.
Sharp. Sammy, you may repent this—
Sam S. Why, we ought all to repent, you know; so, there'll be no harm if I do. Come, be off.
Jail. I'll see you safe out.
Sharp. If you absolutely force me out, out I must go.
                                         [Exit with Jailer. Fog. Ha! ha! ha!—nobody has a chance with us.
Sam S. Poor Matty has got at wrong side of post—He, he, he!
Fog. Oh dear! Oh dear! I wish somebody [175]   would be so good as to stop my laughing— He! he!
Enter Captain Malcolm and Jailer. (The Jailer having resumed his Hat, Keys, &c. on seeing Malcolm, their laughter suddenly stops). Fog. I say, York, how could that Scotchman get into the State Apartments?
Sam S. How could he get in? Damn me, if all the beef-eaters in London can keep them out.
Malc. My business is with Mr. Sharpset, who I understand is in durance in this prison.
Fog. Prison! Oh dear! York! (Sighs).

[Page 58]
Malc. My friend Captain Clifton has interested me in his favor, therefore, Jailer, let me see him.
Sam S. Jailer! As sure as sheep's mutton, he is a jailer.
Jail. He was my prisoner, Sir, but these gentlemen have become responsible for his return, or the payment of his debts, if he does not.
Sam S. Oh, Matty! thou's a rogue!
Malc. A most generous sacrifice!
Sam S. Brotherly love!—Sir, that's every thing, you know.
Malc. Gentlemen, I leave you in the full enjoyment of your pure, delightful feelings.
Fog. Sir, Sir, don't be alarm'd at me—I'm [200]   only a simple Cockney.
Sam S. And I'm no but Yorkshire.
Fog. I have nothing of the pointed keen thistle about me—I'm a tender tulip in a bowpot. Pray tell Mr. Sharpset to come back. We forgot te-to-eh!
Sam S. We forgot just to shake hands at parting.
Malc. True brotherly love—Ha! ha!
Jail. Come, I'll shew them into the strong room.
Fog. Strong room!
Jail. And that I may know which will best suit—a fee!—you understand!
Fog. A fee! Sir, I thought I was coming among the great—
Malc. And not provide a fee! Sir, upon honour, I blush for your total ignorance of the main spring of aw political accommodation— He! he!
Jail. Come, come away; away, I say.

[Page 59]
Fog. York, we're both wanted.
                                         [Exit Jailer, forcing off Fogrum and Sam Sharpset. Malc. Poor lads! they'll have had enough of seeing the world. Faith, were I a Doctor of the Body Politic, I would prescribe for your [225]   grumblers, Foreign Travel: there's no such specific for throwing off the foul humours of discontent, or convincing you of the value of a good constitution.
SONG— Malcolm.

A Highland Laddie heard of war,
   Which set his heart in motion;
He heard the distant cannon roar,
   He saw the smiling Ocean!
      Come well, come woe!
      To sea he'd go—
And left one morning early,
      Loch Lomond Ben,
      And the willow glen,
And Jenny that lov'd him dearly!

He wander'd East, he wander'd South,
   But joy he could not find it;
But he found out this wholesome truth,
   And had the sense to mind it:
      Of a' the earth,
      The bonny North,
To cherish late and early—
      Loch Lomond Ben,
      And the willow glen,
And Jenny that lov'd him dearly!
[Page 60]
SCENE II. An Apartment in Colonel Lindenburg's House. Enter Gambia , meeting Zelinda . Zel. Gambia, my friend—my hope—my succour —speak!
Gam. All is prepared for your flight.
Zel. But, my child?
Gam. Aye, your child! Can his safety then have been forgotten? I have secreted him near the hanging-bridge—should cruelty, or more horrid kindness threaten, there you must fly— Here comes our master—conceal your terrors: Guilt becomes valiant, if innocence tremble. I will be near, and should he offer violence—
Zel. Ah! that thought—
Gam. But he will not—No, no, 'tis impossible! When Beauty is enshrined by Virtue, he must indeed be a devil, that violates the sanctuary—
Zel. Oh! Gambia, where will our miseries end?
Gam. May be, in death, Zelinda; but never in dishonour.
                                         [Exit Gambia. Zel. To what fate am I reserved? The slave of him, who is himself the slave of passion— Oh that my humble voice could reach those hearts who pity the children of affliction.

[Page 61]
SONG— Zelinda.

[25]   Sons of Freedom! hear my story,
   Mercy well becomes the brave,
Humanity is Britain's glory—
   Pity and protect the Slave!

Free-born daughters, who possessing
   Eyes that conquer, hearts that save;
Greet me with a sister's blessing,
   Oh! pity and protect the Slave! Enter Lindenburg and Gambia . Lind. Slave! have you conducted Zelinda hither, as I ordered? (Gambia bows, and points to Zelinda). —Away then to your toil; and d'ye hear, faithfully discharge your duty to the master you serve.
Gam. I will faithfully discharge my duty— to the master I serve.
                                         [Exit, looking up to Heaven. Lind. Approach!—that firm step—those lovely, but composed features—that unruffled bosom, speak a welcome, but unexpected confidence.
Zel. Christian resignation produces christian fortitude.
Lind. (Falling into his arms) Arm'd at all points, I see— Hear me! the bitter wrong I suffer'd from Captain Clifton, might justify my utmost severity; but your beauty redeems all—It commands me to offer every indulgence, every enjoyment—
Zel. [50]   My heart sinks within me!
Lind. You are faint—repose here.
Zel. No!— (recovering herself)
[Page 62]
—I better know my unworthiness, Sir—at humble distance your slave will wait.
Lind. Come, come, away with this—you are in my power.
Zel. I am;—and if you are a man, that secures my safety.
Lind. Your safety I am the guardian of— In these arms you will find it.
Zel. Monster! I know, that by resistance to your will, I may be punished: come to the punishment —I own the crime of being a faithful wife—plead guilty to an abhorrence of a brutal tyrant,—and will kiss the rack that is to torture me.
Lind. (Falling into his arms) Thus I secure obedience.
Zel. O! save me!
Enter Gambia . Lind. Who called you?
Gam. It seemed a heavenly voice—but that the blessed spirits do not suffer misery.
Lind. Begone!—Not obeyed?—Are you not my slave?
Gam. [75]   So devotedly your slave, that I will preserve my master's honour, though the price of duty be my life.
Lind. Indeed!
Gamb. Ah, Sir! be more just to the wretched victims of your power. If we sigh, may it not be from a breast o'ercharged with unmerited suffering? If the eye be dimmed with tears, may it not be from the divine fount of pity that they flow? If, for a moment, we taste of joy, may not an innocent heart give the impulse? If goaded to despair, by the laceration of every
[Page 63]
tie dear to the human heart, we resist the foul oppressor, may it not be, that justice nerves the arm that honour dares the combat, “that heaven gives the victory.”
Lind. School'd by thee, degraded wretch!
Gam. Aye, indeed degraded, for you are my master.
Lind. And thou shalt feel I am so. Within there! Chains and whips for that rebellious slave!
Gam. Fly, Zelinda, to the hanging-bridge —your child is there—away!                                          [Exit Zelinda. —You pass not!
Lind. Impotent, and unarmed—
Gam. [100]   Still in Zelinda's cause I am invulnerable.
Lind. This to try. (Rushes on Gambia—Gambia seizes his arm).
Lind. Ah! resisted! thus, then, I give thee to perdition.
Gam. That fate be thine.
                                         [Exeunt. Slaves. (Without). Our master's voice! Follow! follow!
SCENE III. A Hanging Bridge supported by ropes, suspended from the branches of Trees, which lay across the Torrent. Enter Clifton . Clift. Zelinda, where art thou? where Gambia? here he promised I should meet my wife.— She must, at all hazards, be removed from the power of Lindenburg. Ah! did not a female
[Page 64]
figure rush thro' that tangled brake?—See—again! —'tis my Zelinda!—Ah! she falls! (He rushes out—Re-entering with Zelinda). —My beloved, my restored wife! that pallid cheek! I dread to ask—Lindenburg?
Zel. I have escaped his power; but, alas! have left the noble Gambia engaged in mortal conflict.
Clift. Let us instantly seek the protection of the Governor—Come!
Zel. And leave my child! he is concealed near this place, but where, I know not; first, let us secure his safety.
(Gambia rushes in,—a broken Sword in his hand). Gam. Zelinda and Clifton, here! this is beyond my hopes!
Clift. Tell me of Lindenburg!
Gam. 'Tis his blood that stains the fractur'd blade. Struggling for death, or life—Ah! more than life, combating for Zelinda's safety—I plunged into his breast, this sword, he aimed at mine; it broke, and he fell on the earth, writhing in mortal agony—I could not leave him to a [25]   death of torture—he was my foe, but he was prostrate—the hand that sought my life, lay harmless as the unbrac'd nerve of infancy—I extracted the fractur'd point, that rankled in the wound, and wiping away the gore that stained his guilty breast, I saw there marked—
Clift. What!
Gam. The—Hold, Gambia, exceed not the just measure of thy vengeance—Let the guilty secret rest in his guilty breast—No, Gambia, never shall man's curse vex thy wandering spirit, nor wither the aloe that blooms upon thy grave. Suffice it, that while this gives awful evidence of the dangers she has escaped, it prompts us instantly
[Page 65]
to avoid those that threaten—Soon we shall be pursued by numbers, against whom courage were vain, and flight hopeless.
Zel. What, again in that wretch's power!
Gam. No, no, Gambia still will save that cheek from shame, that form from desolation.
Zel. But, my child? You told me, Gambia, I should see him.
Gam. I'll bring him to your arms. (Going) — I am prevented—Fly! fly! our pursuers are at hand—But, fear not for your boy—unless terror [50]   draws him from his concealment, he is safe: nay, there is no time for thanks, or question— Instant pass the bridge (To Zelinda) —Delay were destructive to Clifton's life (To Clifton) —fatal to Zelinda's honour! Away! away!
                                         [Exeunt Clifton and Zelinda, over the Bridge. Som. This way, by this road they fled—Secure the hanging-bridge, that cuts off their retreat.
                                         (Gambia ascends the Tree, to which the Bridge is fasten'd, and with the broken Sword cuts the Cords which support it. At the moment of the Pursuer's entrance upon it, it falls). Enter Somerdyke , and Six of Lindenburg's Servants. Som. Confusion! they have escaped!
Zel. We are safe, my husband.
(Child runs on the Bridge). Child. It was my mother's voice! Mother! mother!
Zel. Alas! my child!
Som. Her child! then we triumph—seize him!
[Page 66]
Move one step further, and you will see him buried in the waters.—Submit, or this instant is his last! (Holding him up in the act of precipitating him)
Zel. I do submit.
Gam. Never! (Gambia, who has concealed himself in the branches, snatches him up into the Tree). —Father, receive your child! (Throws the Child across the Stream). They have him—he is safe! Murderers of innocence! here is a nobler victim! Ha! ha! ha!
SCENE IV. An Apartment in Lindenburg's . Enter Lindenburg , supported by Slaves. Slave. (To Lindenburg). How do you feel, Sir?
Lind. That soon this feverish life will end. But, oh! uncheered by vengeance I must die! Slaves, mark my words—Lay me in the earth, even as I am!—no hallowed ground—no bell— no shroud!—Do you mark, I say?
Enter Somerdyke . Som. Master, your assassin is secured!
Lind. Thy words have renewed the springs of life.—Bring him before me.
Gambia is brought in, guarded. Som. Dost thou behold thy victim?
Gam. With heartfelt pity I do behold him!
Lind. Wretch! do you triumph in your guilt? You erect your head—

[Page 67]
Gam. Only to the elevation of my integrity— no higher.
Som. He has confess'd the guilty deed.
Lind. Then consign him to the executioner— ask not for mercy.
Gam. Mercy is for the guilty. The only mercy I shall ask, is that of heaven.
Lind. Where's Zelinda?
Gam. Happy in her husband's arms.
Lind. Death, by torture!
Som. [25]   Ay, branded first, then executed.
Gam. Branded! (Eyeing Lindenburg) —What, on the breast?—Look to your master—see, he changes colour, he staggers!
Lind. Liar! 'tis false! (Endeavouring to subdue his agitation).
Gam. Sir, will you not save me from that stamp of infamy? I shall die, indeed, dishonoured, if the hangman's brand disgrace my body. (Eyeing Lindenburg).
Lind. Villanous slave!
Gam. Honour'd master!
Som. His presence torments him—lead him away!
Lind. Hold—release him!
Som. Release him!
Lind. Am I not heard?—Leave us together!
Som. With a murderer!
Lind. Aye, alone! (To Slaves) Why am I not obeyed? (Pointing out). (They go out, leaving Lindenburg and Gambia). —Approach near, Gambia—I—what shall I say?
Gam. Nothing—your anxious eye asks the truth—thus it is—while struggling to remove the weapon that rankled in its wound, I saw, seared in your breast, the brand of—thief.

[Page 68]
Lind. 'Tis true; 'twas that made me resist all [50]   aid—fly from my home, to seek, in this wilderness, an unhallow'd grave; but I am not guilty— by heaven and hell, I am not! In Europe I was the associate of gamesters: in their loathed temple, they lured me to be their ministering priest, then cast me out their ruin'd victim. In the streets of Paris I encountered a villain, laden with the spoil. I demanded satisfaction, presented pistols—at that moment the police appeared, the coward wretch accused me of robbery. I was convicted—branded, and dishonour'd! Oh! agony of spirit! Worse than this body's torture! (Is falling, Gambia endeavours to support him— he starts from him) Slave! I am in thy power— how wilt thou use it?
Gam. In saving, if I can, my master's life. By inflicting that wound, I preserved the innocent —by healing it, I may save the guilty.
Lind. Amazement this to the man who consigned thee to an ignominious death!
Gam. If we retire from human observance, and to your wound apply some herbs of healing power—
Lind. And wilt thou? Name thy reward—
Gam. I never traffic with my humanity.
Lind Ah, Nature, this is thy work, pure and [75]   undefiled!—But my secret—is it revealed?
Gamb. Revealed!—I may destroy, but never can betray—
Lind. How then to secure it?
Gamb. I am your slave—here is my breast!—
Lind. (Falling into his arms) Receive me in its noble sanctuary!—My wound calls for help— African, thy virtues have subdued me!
Gam. To be so vanquished, is man's proudest victory!
                                         [Exeunt.
[Page 69]
SCENE V. An Indian Country. The Governor, Clifton, Malcolm, Stella, Zelinda and Child, with Slaves and Attendants, discovered. Clift. Such, my Lord, were her perils, such her deliverance! But, alas! Gambia was seized by Lindenburg's slaves.
Zel. Oh! save him from their savage fury!
Gov. My afflicted friend, I cannot wrench from its grasp the iron law of slavery; but I should indeed dishonour that venerable Monarch, whose unworthy delegate I am, did I not administer it in the mercy that he loved.
                                         (Shouts without, and voices exclaiming “Gambia is pardon'd!—Gambia is free!”) Clift. Ah! Gambia free—Blest sounds!
Gam. Where is she? Where is Zelinda?
(Enters). Clift., Zel. Joy to Gambia!
Gam. My joy's to come—beloved Zelinda, the path to happiness lies through the vale of tears; but it is passed, and sunshine again expands its glories. Lindenburg lives to repentance, to atonement —he sends thee freedom, and by Gambia's hand! (Presenting Paper).
Zel. My preserver!
Clift. My friend!
Gov. Go, worthy African! and tell the world, that true liberty is the offspring of peace, the nurse of humanity, the parent of benevolence;
[Page 70]
its home, the world; its family, mankind; its [25]   allegiance, Heaven.
(Gay Music is heard). Clift. What sounds of mirth? Ah! Miss Von Frump, transported into Mrs. Sharpset, comes to be presented to your Excellency.
(Slaves enter with White Cockades, followed by Sharpset , and Miss Von Frump , in marriage dresses). Sharp. How do you all do?—My Lord Governor, Mrs. Sharpset—Clifton, Malcolm, give me joy!
Gov. Receive, Madam, my sincere congratulations —nay, do not blush.
Sharp. 'Tis excusable; but I hope I shall never see her blush for her husband. When I cause that heart to sigh, that has brought comfort to mine—When I dim that eye with tears, that has brightened mine with joy, may dishonour and contempt pursue me.
Miss V. F. But, where's my nephew?
Sharp. And Little Sammy—Oh! I've liberated them, and here they come.
Enter Fogrum and Sam Sharpset . Miss V. F. Behold my husband!
Fog. Husband!
Sharp. Fogrum, my pretty boy, receive thy uncle's blessing.
Fog. Sir, on this stupendous occasion, I can only say—York, you're wanted.
Sam S. Brotherly love, Matty! Mind, stick [50]   to that.
Malc. Allow me to present my bride. Come, Sir, rivals no more, your hand. (To Fogrum).

[Page 71]
Fog. Well, Sir, I shall be glad to entertain you in London.
Sam S. And I, in York.—Of course, you'll not think of stopping there.
Malc. Not while the road leads to bonny Edinbro'.
Gov. Clifton, I shall instantly dispatch you with advices to England. Gambia, will you accompany him?
Gam. England! shall I behold thee? Talk of fabled land, or magic power! But what land, that poet ever sung, or enchanter swayed, can equal that, which, when the slave's foot touches, he becomes free—his prisoned soul starts forth, his swelling nerves burst the chain that enthrall'd him, and, in his own strength he stands, as the rock he treads on, majestic and secure.
FINALE. Stella.
Should our praise of Freedom's Isle,
Win a sweet, consenting smile,
   Your kindness saves
   Your willing Slaves,
And crowns with joy their anxious toil! Malcolm and Clifton.
[75]   Clothed in honor's proud array,
Ah! what can British hearts dismay?
   If beauty's eyes—
   The soldier's prize!—
With smiles protect our humble lay! Chorus.
Should our praise of Freedom's Isle, &c.
[Page 72]
Fogrum.
Your own dear Cockney do not flout—
Remove each anxious dread and doubt!
   I fear this night—
   No—that's not right,—
Here, York, you're wanted—I am out! Sam Sharpset.
If you, my lasses fair and tall,
Have wishes that are conjugal,
   I'll gallop down
   To Yorkshire town,
And bring up husbands for you all! Chorus.
Should our praise of Freedom's Isle, &c. Zelinda.
If you pronounce an adverse doom,
A wanderer again I roam!—
   And must I go?
   Ah! pray say—no!
But make this place my happy home!
My curtsies, Ladies, I present:
Dear Beaux, my smiles to you are sent—
   I'll try all arts
[100]      To win your hearts!
And sing you into kind consent! Chorus.
Should our praise of Freedom's Isle, &c. Back matter

[Page 9]
Main text ACT I. SCENE I. —An Apartment in the Royal Palace. The Prince, Emanuel, Alonzo . Prince.
This day, my friends, is pregnant with event,
And consternation saddens every face:
A realm which rais'd its head among the nations,
Droops in despondence, and expects its fall—
The hour when Nature, in convulsion, hurl'd
Our lofty domes and temples to the dust,
Was fraught with less calamity—the crown
Now trembles on our head—the fierce Napoleon
Not satisfied with rapine burns for more;
[Page 10]

Courts a new dynasty, and pants to raise
Some tool, some upstart fav'rite, to the throne. Emanuel.
The madness of Ambition knows no bounds;
But, still aspiring, rears its daring front,
To meet the lightning, which the vengeful arm
Of Justice launches on the impious head:
Yet should the Tyrant rule uncurb'd, unblasted;
All is not lost, my Prince, heaven has in store
One consolation left to raise th' oppress'd;
Behold! a navy waits your royal call
To waft us safely to your western world;
Whose arms ev'n now extend to greet her Prince,
And give that liberty denied him here. Prince.
Thank gracious heaven, that one resource remains;
And should imperious Fate our flight command
[25]   We must obey—our duty is submission—
Yet feels my heart an agonizing pang,
To leave such numerous subjects of tried worth;
Of firm fidelity towards our crown,
To all the horrors of a tyrant's rage:
Yet would my life, in sacrifice, preserve
My faithful people from impending bondage,
That life were theirs—but nought my stay avails,
Save to exalt the triumph of his power,
And add another victim to captivity.
[Page 11]
Emanuel.
All is prepar'd, my Liege ,—the British fleet
Awaits, to give safe conduct to our voyage. Prince.
Enough—my family demands my presence:
Watch well, lest Treason, lurking in the dark,
Assassinate our purpose—Treason's wiles
Should be suspected from a subtle foe.—
How comes it that Alvarez keeps aloof,
And joins not in our councils? Alonzo.
I beheld him,
Yet scarce an hour in converse with Bellegarde . Prince.
With Bellegarde !
Keep on that Gallic tool an eagle's eye,
His insolence each moment rears its crest:
That Frenchman's bosom is a dungeon foul,
Breeding the toad's and serpent's venom'd fangs,
[50]   Which calls on Caution to repel his guile—
At noon we meet in conference again.                                          [Exit.
[Page 12]
Emanuel.
Too much Alvarez courts that haughty Gaul,
Who priding in his master's pomp of power,
In imitation, proves his arrogance. Alonzo.
This has not 'scap'd th' observance of my eye:
Pray heaven that my suspicions may be false—
Perhaps unfounded—but a whisper steals
That to the fair Elvira he makes court;
Who meets his soaring wishes with a smile:
But much I doubt that in his Prince's favor,
Alvarez ranks so highly as of late:
His bold ambition sports too high a wing,
To claim that peerless damsel for his prize;
A beauteous scion from Braganza 's root:
Such rash presumption must have given offence;
But, lo Alvarez' self. Enter Alvarez . Alvarez.
My noble friends;
I greatly fear that I have play'd the truant;
When did you last behold our gracious Prince? Emanuel.
His Highness has just left us, marveling much,
[Page 13]

That thou, Alvarez , should'st absent thyself,
From councils of such moment to the state. Alvarez.
Affairs of no small weight have kept me hence,
For well ye know, th' importance of this day. Alonzo.
[75]   A most eventful day! our country's fate
Hangs on a spider's web, that asks no storm
To tear it into shreds— Alvarez.
Nor need we dread it—
The frightful cloud that hovers o'er our realm,
Is of Imagination's coinage, Fancy's sport,
That, wanton, conjures up terrific forms
To shake our courage—we disdain such fear;
Reason at once annihilates the phantom. Emanuel.
What meanest thou? Alvarez.
Napoleon is our friend;
No cloud of thunder, but a summer's sun,
To cheer our gloomy land of apprehension.
[Page 14]
Emanuel.
Suspect thy confidence is on a base
That sinking will betray. Alvarez.
Fear not my Lord;
Napoleon is a cedar which out spreads
His shelt'ring branches to protect the world;
Whose root in Earth's deep centre fix'd; whose head
Amid the stars: beneath his ample shade,
Braganza 's House shall flourish long in peace. Alonzo.
Alvarez , 'tis a tree, a poisonous tree,
Nurs'd by the victims of unbounded pride;
Nurs'd by the purple floods of precious life;
Nurs'd by the widow's and the orphan's tears.
[100]   Perish my country, perish all our race,
E're it shall thrive beneath such baleful shade.
How can thy tongue turn advocate for vice?
Methinks thine eloquence would gild his crimes,
And to a demon give a cherub's face.
To trust were folly, for Napoleon 's deeds,
All justify suspicion—ev'n Credulity
Would blush to listen to his promises.
Alvarez , give one solitary act,
Brighten'd by Honor 's ray, and I will thank thee,
And cancel my opinion of Napoleon .
[Page 15]
Alvarez.
Too hastily ye listen to reports:
Too often Slander steals the voice of Truth :
But grant Napoleon 's vices, grant his guilt;
Where is the hand to save us from his gripe?
Brave as thou art, to warlike deeds enur'd,
Resistance were in vain; our trembling state,
Crush'd by his arm, would sink to rise no more.
He offers friendship—shadow'd by his wing,
Lo Portugal secure, and stands rever'd. Alonzo.
The shadow of his wing! the shade of death !
How many stars, with brilliancy that shone,
Fair constellations in our hemisphere,
Have disappear'd behind that baleful cloud!
Where is Batavia, Venice, Genoa ?
[125]   Known but by name, or only known his slaves;
And yet he offer'd friendship to those states;
Seduc'd by flattery; crush'd them with his kindness:
More deadly is his friendship than his hate:
The one, resisted, gives us only death;
The other, chains; and what is worse—disgrace. Alvarez.
If vain resistance prove, what other step?
[Page 16]
Emanuel.
To shun the Tyrant's yoke. Alvarez.
Romantic schemes!
States, Don Emanuel , like mankind, grow old,
And is it now, bow'd down by weight of years,
For Portugal to ramble on adventures,
And found new empires on a foreign shore? Emanuel.
Nurs'd in the calm and sunshine of a court,
Ye give to pigmy dangers, giant forms;
While to th' experienc'd eye, the frightful voyage,
Is but a summer party, bent on pleasure;
And when your Fancy paints our distant lands,
Ye then reverse the telescope, and view
A mighty empire as a small domain. Alvarez.
Enough my Lords—we differ on this head,
But one there is, in which our hearts unite;
To strain each nerve to serve our noble Prince:
Him must I seek or merit his reproof.                                          [Exit.
[Page 17]
Enter a Messenger , hastily. Messenger.
My Lords,
[150]   Beyond the bounds prescrib'd the French advance,
And reach our city e'er the setting sun. Alonzo.
There is no room, Emanuel , for delay,
The die is cast—'tis liberty or chains. Emanuel.
Say, is the Prince inform'd? Messenger.
But now I left him;
And as in haste I pass'd the Palace gate,
Th' Ambassador of France demanded audience.—
His Highness sends his orders for your presence.                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 18]
SCENE II. —A Street. Alvarez and Bellegarde meeting. Bellegarde.
Alvarez , why that gloom upon thy brow? Alvarez.
Thou read'st the inward working of my mind,
Ambition and Revenge strive there for mastery.
This morn I gain'd an audience of the Prince,
And for Elvira 's hand I press'd my suit.
Alvarez' blood it seems must not presume
To mix with royalty . Bellegarde.
I thought as much;
But let not that disturb thee; 'ere the morn
The haughty Regent kneels to thee , Alvarez .
Our troops are with rapidity advancing;
Pass a few hours, they enter at your gates. Alvarez.
Knows this the Prince?
[Page 19]
Bellegarde.
The Regent is inform'd
A messenger arriv'd—I follow'd him,
And enter'd as he left the royal presence:
Well knowing the advantage which attends
On first impressions. Alvarez.
How was he affected? Bellegarde.
His soul on fire, and resolutely bent
On emigration. Little did I think
His placid, lamb-like spirit could assume
The lion's port, and be at once the king.
He bade me instantly command their halt;
[25]   Or trusting to his own, and British friends,
Who sought his safety, he would straight embark.
I sooth'd him; said Napoleon was his friend,
Who wish'd to snatch him from th' insidious grasp
Of that proud Isle —indignant, he replied
He was no school boy—could distinguish well
The colour of his friends—nor would endure
That other powers should subjugate his will;
And, fraught with insolence, divide his throne. Alvarez.
Didst thou succeed in calming him, Bellegarde ?
[Page 20]
Bellegarde.
Soon as I felt his resolution firm,
I chang'd my ground, and wore Submission's face;
Nay more, to lull him into dead security,
At once I penn'd dispatches in his presence,
With peremptory orders for a halt:
This soften'd him. Alvarez.
Thou dost not mean a halt? Bellegarde.
No, no Alvarez , think'st thou Bellegarde
Has serv'd the wily Emperor so long
Thus to be dup'd?—Another messenger
Will be dispatch'd to bid them force their march,
And instantly detach some troops of horse
To hold the fort-lin'd Tagus in subjection—
Thus caught, Braganza 's sun shall set 'ere night:
But be it still our care it doth not rise
[50]   With brighter glory in the western sphere:
His fleet, prepar'd, beneath his treasure groans;
All which is thine, if thou canst yet delay
The purpos'd voyage. For thy counsel's sake
I think he holds thee dear—he knows thee wise
And leans with faith on thee; yet sternly spurns
Thee as an abject slave, too mean to mix
Thy blood with that which flows through royal veins.
[Page 21]
Alvarez.
This stings—this rouses my advent'rous soul
To gain revenge and empire at a grasp.
'Tis true he asks my counsel, yet suspects;
And tho' he deems me such a humble worm,
Yet shall he feel that worm conceals a fang. Bellegarde.
There spoke Alvarez' self, whose soaring mind
Is form'd for empire—give Ambition wing;
But, waste we not our time; each sand is precious:
The Council meets at noon—persuade the Prince
To trust the generous clemency of France;
And may thy golden hopes of future greatness
Give to thy tongue a splendid eloquence.
The navy lost—irreparable the loss!
Fain would Napoleon 's hand the trident grasp—
Who holds it, holds the sceptre of the world;
But wanting, feels himself scarce half a king.
Alvarez , clothe thee in a deep disguise;
[75]   Nor let them mark in thee the Emp'ror's friend—
Close in thy heart conceal the future storm. Alvarez.
Discard thy dread— Alvarez boldly dares
The road, the dangerous road that leads to empire.
The smile of Courtesey shall mask my cheek,
While underneath, the mine, destruction fraught,
[Page 22]

Sleeps unobserv'd—but much I fear the Prince
Will still adhere him to his firm resolve;
The promis'd aid of Britain spurs him on. Bellegarde.
Curse on that country—the malignant star
That sheds a pestilence where'er it shines,
And palsies every nerve of enterprise;
Ev'n now her navy, like a murky cloud,
Hangs threat'ning on the zenith of thy hopes;
Yet can it only thunder at a distance,
Nor reach us here—farewell—success attend thee.
The Council ended; let us meet again.                                          [Exit Alva. Bellegarde.
Poor, dup'd Alvarez , go, thy hopes enjoy;
Blind to the quicksands which thy foot shall tread:
Fool! dost thou think the giant arm of France
Exerts itself to place thee on a throne,
And by thy side a Princess of the House
Of poor, devoted, weak, proscrib'd Braganza !—
Chains and a dungeon will become thee better.
The Crown, Alvarez , never will be thine:
[100]   Were vacant every throne the world displays,
Napoleon would find tenants for them all.
Thus Frenchmen rule by art as well as arms;
And use Ambition, just to edge their tools;
And deem them lumber , when the work is done.                                          [Exit.
[Page 23]
ACT II. SCENE I. —The Garden of the Royal Palace. Alvarez and Elvira . Elvira.
Alvarez , in compliance with thy wishes,
I meet thee here, a proof of my affection,
If of affection further proof be wanting. Alvarez.
I question not thy love, and yet this day
May put it to an unexpected test. Elvira.
Explain—what means this unexpected test? Alvarez.
Since our last interview I sought the Prince ,
And urg'd my prayer—his sanction to our union;
Confess'd my humble claim to his alliance;
Reminding him of service to the state.
Surveying me with searching eye, he said,
[Page 24]

“Is this a time to dream of love and dalliance?
“This awful moment while the hand of Heaven
“Holds o'er our threaten'd heads the trembling balance,
“Charg'd with our country's fate?—far different cares,
“Far different prospects should engage thy thought;
“Nor for a love-tale leave a falling realm.”
No more he deign'd, retiring in disgust,
In which I mark'd his secret pride of soul,
Which said, in language not to be mistaken,
I wish'd to purify my blood's foul stream,
By sullying the fair fount of the Braganzas . Elvira.
Thou canst not feel more sharply than Elvira
The Prince 's opposition to our marriage;
[25]   But wait, amidst the turbulence of times,
Till heaven in gracious mercy calms the storm:
Then here, or in some region far remov'd,
His heart may yield propitious to our wishes:
Justly he told thee, 'twas no time for love. Alvarez.
No time for love! inform me then the time;
Th' unfeeling Regent , should he seek those climes,
May find some loftier rival to my hopes:
Then thinkest thou that I will follow him,
To swell his train, and, disappointed, see
[Page 25]

Thy beauty in th' embraces of another?
No! no, Elvira , tho' thou know'st my love
Stands not in competition ev'n with life;
A scene like this, my soul could never brook;
But if Elvira wishes for my death— Elvira.
Talk not of death, but put me to the proof,
And say, what wishes labour in thy heart?
Know, if reluctant to the purpos'd voyage,
Thou think'st thy prayer is destitute of hope,
I now am ready to renounce my fortunes;
To quit my friends, to sacrifice my all,
And leave the splendors of a court for thee. Alvarez.
Not so severe, and painful is the trial:
Where'er we roam, the finger of Contempt
Will point not at us for our humble station.
[50]   But, hast thou not ambition in thy soul?
Sleeps in thy veins the blood of the Braganzas ,
That thus thou canst forego the charms of empire? Elvira.
What meanest thou Alvarez ? well thou knowest me
Of no aversion to the scene of courts:
Yet these, ev'n these, would I desert for thee.
[Page 26]
Alvarez.
Were mine a throne to offer to thy beauty,
How should I joy to see Elvira fill it!
That brow would well become a diadem;
And 'stead of borrowing , augment its radiance. Elvira.
Disperse this mystery that thus clouds thy speech—
It seems to jest; and yet thy serious eye,
Bespeaks thy bosom pregnant with deep schemes.
Thy lips seem charg'd with matters of high moment. Alvarez.
We live, Elvira , in eventful times:
With every moon our fortune's prone to change:
To day the Monarch's head sustains a crown;
That head to-morrow humbled in the dust:
And he , but only yesterday a slave,
To day shall stretch his sceptre o'er a world.
Thou toldest me my fortunes should be thine ,
That thou would'st join me in the lowest sphere:
Then surely thou would'st meet me on a throne . Elvira.
A throne !—a diadem !—you trifle with me;
And mean to sport with my credulity!
[Page 27]
Alvarez.
[75]   A jest would ill become those lips, Elvira ,
While thoughts momentous labour in my soul!
Thou art the peerless gem for which I pant;
And canst thou blame Alvarez , should he wish
To see that jewel's lustre in a crown. Elvira.
I scarcely dare conceive thy latent meaning!
To grace my temples with a diadem!
Resolve this riddle—banish all suspense! Alvarez.
Know then thy friend Braganza 's fate approaches!
His boasted beam of royalty obscur'd,
What is Braganza , but in name a prince?
A higher genius awes him and controls:
Press'd by Napoleon 's power, he is no more
Than were a wren within the eagle's gripe!
With ease o'ercome!—he abdicates his throne!—
It must be fill'd—what if Alvarez fill it? Elvira.
Thou fill the throne of Portugal !—thy words
Are thunder in my ears—speak—art thou leagu'd
With him, the enemy of all mankind,
Whose boasted conquests are rank usurpations;
Who rules the nations with an iron hand?
[Page 28]

Soars thy ambition to a traitor's name?—
Turn'd vile usurper, whose foul deeds of death
The pen of History shall write in blood?
Think'st thou Elvira will unite in crimes,
[100]   And smile upon the grandeur of a theft?
Thou knowest not Elvira —true, I'm proud;
But never shall a treason taint this heart.
Mistaken man!—beyond the tyrant's reach
Prepar'd to fly, the Prince will shun his power. Alvarez.
Vainly he hopes to 'scape impending fate,
And deems the hosts of France in sluggishness;
Undone beyond the powers of restoration;
Wakes from his dream, and finds himself a vassal. Elvira.
Ha! is it so?—then, duty be obey'd!
In thee, my simple confidence repos'd!
Deceiv'd, I fondly priz'd thee for thy virtues !
All love is fled—it holds no competition
'Twixt me, and firm allegiance to my Prince,
For ever, more the parent than the sovereign:
For all his friendship shall I thus requite him,
And say to Gratitude, “I know thee not?” Alvarez.
Then, to the fatal scaffold yield my head,
And with a calm indifference, see a heart
[Page 29]

Torn from its seat, which only sighs for thee.
Go, hasten to the Prince—enjoy thy triumph;
Exulting pityless o'er fallen Alvarez ;
Report what thou hast heard, and seal his fate. Elvira.
Thou knowest that I wish not for thy death;
But thou hast forfeited on me all claim;
[125]   Who deem'd thy heart unsullied as the snow;
Not blacken'd by a crime that would disgrace
The humblest and the meanest of mankind.                                          [Going. Alvarez.
Ha! I must now dissemble, play the hypocrite.
Away with love, less precious than my life,
In danger trembling on a woman's tongue.                                          [Aside.
Elvira , do not leave me thus in anger:
If then esteem, disinterested love,
Which would have plac'd thee in a loftier sphere,
Too warm resentment of the Prince's scorn,
Have led my feet to stray from Virtue's path,
Is it for thee, for whom I dar'd to sin,
Thus cruel, to upbraid me with the crime,
(If call'd a crime that sought thy happiness?)
Say rather, should'st thou not by gentle means
Restore thy friend to duty and allegiance?
For thou canst mould Alvarez at thy will.
[Page 30]
Elvira.
Ought I to trust thee? can the heart deep stain'd—
Can the foul blot of Treason be wash'd out?
Ought I, on such a weak and slender thread,
Confide the Prince's safety, whilst the storm
Gathers around and howls for his destruction? Enter Emilia . Emilia.
Your pardon for this sudden interruption:
The Princess anxiously expects your presence.                                          [To Elvira. Elvira.
Forgive, Alvarez , my abrupt departure.                                          [Exeunt Elvira et Emilia. Alvarez.
[150]   Curse on the fatal secret, that escap'd me!
Curse on my idiot tongue, that trusted woman!
My childish passion has struck out a spark,
Which kindles a volcano to destroy.
Why, heedless of my safety, slept my dagger—
It might have done its office—done it safely.
Too deep in treason am I to retreat;
A pebble must not now impede my steps,
When rocks I have to climb to my ambition
[Page 31]

Oh! where was thought that left me at the moment!
Now, now my bosom with a tempest swells;
When this small weapon had preserv'd a calm.                                          [Looking at a dagger.
Yet may she not betray—for still she holds
A portion of affection for my life.
But wherefore waste I thought? If not betray'd,
I bind the lordly lion in my toils,
That soon to me must crouch for his existence.
But let me seek Bellegarde , whose friendly hand
Would clothe me with the purple, fix the crown,
And set the frown of Fortune at defiance.                                          [Exit. SCENE II. —An Apartment in the Palace. Princess of Brazil and Elvira . Princess.
The Prince's noble spirit will not brook
To hold his sceptre at a tyrant's nod;
And more disgraceful yet, to fill a throne
Beset and over aw'd by Arrogance:
Watch'd by the spies and minions of their master,
Unsafe, existing on each hour's caprice.
What is it, but to kneel a royal slave;
A splendid triumph of a Slave's ambition?
[Page 32]
Elvira.
I know the Prince's height of soul—sublime!—
Would rather reign the Lord of some poor isle,
An hungry soil scarce yielding life's support,
Where Liberty resided, than command
Luxuriant realms, and hear his subjects groan. Enter the Prince . Prince, [Taking Elvira's hand and surveying her attentively.]
Elvira , tell me, hast thou lately seen
Alvarez —where?—and when?—and what discourse?
This morn, he importun'd me for thy hand—
Say, dost thou think him worthy thy regard?
Art thou not much mistaken in his virtues?
Too oft beneath the smile of love and friendship,
Too often lurks the demon of destruction.
Long had this man possess'd my confidence;
Loaded with honors, that the nation envied:
And yet I view'd him as a second self.
Friendships are sometimes hollow, and a canker
[25]   Lurks in the bud, and blasts its opening bloom.
Elvira , has he not thy wishes still?
[Page 33]
Elvira.
Let me confess, Alvarez won my love,
But holds it now no more; 'tis lost for ever!
Press me, my Prince, no further on this head;
Spare my poor heart the sad, ungrateful office:
Withdraw your confidence, for danger hangs,
Hangs by a single hair upon your life.
You walk towards the precipice of Fate.
Watch well the wily minister of France;
He may have thrones to offer. Prince.
Ho! who waits?                                          [Enter an Attendant.
Haste and command Alonzo to our presence.
Elvira , it requires no lynx's eye
To see within that heart of thine, a war
Between thy love and loyalty—enough,
The fountain that I fancied pure is foul:
The rock, I deem'd my confidence had trod,
Trembles beneath its foot, and proves its grave.                                          [Enter Alonzo.
Then instantly prepare ye for the voyage.                                          [To the Princess and Elvira.
Alonzo , our suspicions are confirm'd:                                          [Exeunt Princess et Elvira.
Alvarez' heart is rotten to the core.
Let spies attend upon his every step;
Observe the wily winding of the Gaul,
[Page 34]

The minister, the treacherous tool of France,
[50]   Who covers chains and dungeons with a smile:
See! how the Villain's poison shows its power!
A thousand eyes are scarce enough to watch them. Alonzo.
My Prince, that traitor walks not unobserv'd—
But what new matter? Prince.
Thou shalt be inform'd;
The council claims our presence; haste, Alonzo ,
For life and freedom tremble on the moment.                                          [Exeunt in haste. SCENE III. —An Apartment in Bellegarde's House. Bellegarde, Girronde, Larron , and other Conspirators . Bellegarde.
Well met my friends; the fate of Portugal
Is seal'd, if Fortune yet remains our own.
The Regent, lull'd in dull security,
Sleeps on a throne that totters to its fall.
Deceiv'd, entrapp'd, he thinks our army halts;
My orders urge them on with speedier step.
[Page 35]

How vain and impotent the Regent's threats!
The arm of France has paraliz'd his powers:
Cunning, he shuffles, tricks, and runs his rounds
In vain—our high-bred hounds are on his back. Girronde.
How laughable to see him veering round
With every blast; the weathercock of Fate;
Unsteady, knowing not his friends from foes;
A straw, a feather fluttering in the storm! Bellegarde.
Beneath weak Folly's banner let him list;
And trust his all to British sophistry.
For what is Britain but a brawling rill,
That winds its feeble, shallow, muddy course,
In opposition to the world of waves;
Soon seiz'd, and swallow'd midst the mighty roar. Girronde.
Yet not here rest the labours of Napoleon :
Our Gallic Hercules shall work new wonders!
The Ottoman shall bow beneath his yoke,
And lay the shining crescent at his feet:
[25]   The haughty East do homage to his throne;
The Western World submit to be his slave:
The princes of the earth but meanly crawl ;
Napoleon mounts the chariot of the Sun.
[Page 36]

What dares prescribe the limits of his power,
Presumptuous,—but the limits of the world? Bellegarde.
But let us be economists of time:
Exertion now should ride upon the spur—
Each minute holds a kingdom on its wing.
Our business is to counteract event.
Spread then our emissaries through the city—
Confusion be the order of the day!
Harangue the mob, and rouse to insurrection;
That if our armies move too tardily,
They may be prompted to restrain the navy;
Surround the Palace, nor permit the Prince
To seek for safety in a sudden flight.
Dwell on the peerless virtues of our Emperor ;
Nor spare th' unfailing argument of gold,
Which ye shall lack not—thunder in their ears,
The Prince has drain'd their country to the lees,
And bears their treasures to a foreign shore.
Napoleon 's soul is fix'd upon this day:
To disappoint his wishes, what ensues?
Lo! Life and Death are vassals of his voice! Larron.
[50]   Already have we urg'd those arguments;
Yet gain few converts, though enforc'd with gold.
They love their Prince, and say that he retires
To break his chains; prepare them an asylum,
[Page 37]

To which a loyal people may resort,
And join his standard, from the Tyrant's grasp. Bellegarde.
Curse on their virtues! what, will nothing move them?
Ha! do their feverish palates hanker still,
Towards Braganza , that forbidden fruit;
That poison tempting, yet replete with death?
Then must we turn Physician to the State,
And let it blood—I warrant we can cool it.
But slight rebuffs must not destroy our purpose.
Still must you strive to stir their sluggish souls:
Nay, promise, if propitious to our wish,
The plunder of the treasure-loaded navy.
Try, will not avarice outweigh allegiance? Larron.
We spare no labour for the grand design;
Yet all our efforts cannot boast success. Bellegarde.
Enough—but see that those our power has gain'd,
Be duly station'd at their posts, and arm'd
With secret weapons. Let them be instructed;
And teach them not to shrink from desperate deeds.
We must not now turn cowards at a phantom.
The Prince , if he resist, must not be spar'd.
[75]   I would convey instructions to Alvarez
Ere meets the Council.
[Page 38]
Girronde.
Then dispatch is needful. Bellegarde.
Haste you with this , and give it to his hand.                                          [Delivering a letter.                                          [Exit Girronde. Enter a Messenger . Messenger.
My Lord, our armies now approach the gates;
Each heart of animation full—despising rest—
Despising sustenance—despising rocks,
Hills, forests, mountains that with cloud capp'd heads
Oppose their progress to the fane of glory. Bellegarde.
Let trusty guides attend upon their entrance,
And lead them onward to their various posts.
Meanwhile let others busy sow sedition
Amongst the Regent's troops, and bid them turn
Upon their ships the cannon of St. Julian.
Each to his station—grave it on your hearts,
That when a Gallic hand commands the helm,
The vessel braves the tumults of the deep,
And mocks the howling genius of the storm.                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 39]
ACT III. SCENE I. —A Council Chamber. The Prince, Archbishop of Lisbon, Archbishop of Braga, Emanuel, Alonzo, Alvarez , and other Officers of State . Prince.
My faithful counsellors, this awful day
Demands a high attention—every hour
Swells with importance, hastens to our fate.
Fled is the Dove of Peace, she finds in Europe
No resting place—then blindly should we trust
A tyrant's clemency, who through the earth
Sounds out the trump of discord and grim war,
And feasts upon the miseries of mankind? Alvarez.
Let not a dread disturb your royal mind:
I see, and hail a glorious beam of light,
Which pierces through the darkness of the cloud,
And gives a promise of a brighter day
[Page 40]

To great Braganza 's House, which needs not seek
Precarious safety in a foreign clime. Prince.
Whence spring thy sanguine hopes, and where our safety?
The Tyrant's arm now reaches to our gates—
Are we to wait, and trust his clemency,
And prove the mercy which the helpless lamb
Meets from the famish'd wolf, when in his power? Alvarez.
Napoleon offers friendship to our realm;
Holds out to Portugal a guardian hand.
To him all Europe bows—he only asks
For friendship in return, and vigorous aid,
To gain that peace, for which my Sovereign sighs. Prince.
[25]   'Tis he alone who lifts his arm against us:
Yet he, with all his daring, views with fear
The giant power of Britain —sacred spot!—
The fam'd asylum from despotic power;
Where banish'd Kings and Princes find a home;
Where reigns a sovereign in his people's hearts:
That happy Isle, where Freedom only dwells,
To rescue from a tyrant's rage the world.
Wishes he peace with England ? to what end?
To snatch the sword of Justice from her hand—
To slay and plunder with impunity.
[Page 41]
Emanuel.
To trust his word, were surely worse than folly;
Whose mad ambition has more heights to climb;
To pinion Princes to his chariot wheels,
And, like the drunken Macedonian boy,
Sighs for more worlds to slake his thirst of sway. Alvarez.
Nay, grant all this, my Prince; yet, such his power
Impetuous, ocean-like o'erwhelming earth,
And sweeping with a whirlwind of destruction
That vain it were, nay madness, to oppose
When gentle methods might avert his wrath,
And you, my Prince, may yet possess the throne. Alonzo.
And still shall hold it, though Alvarez doubts;
Still shall possess it, though Napoleon frown.
Heavens! must we see the offspring of Braganza
[50]   In mean submission at the Tyrant's foot?
The Western World is anxious to embrace us;
Where bounteous nature every blessing yields;
Secure from rapine—where the Usurper's rod
Shall stretch no proud dominion; but where peace
And happiness reside. It wounds me much
To hear thee trumpet forth the Despot's praise;
Decking thy idol out in gaudy plumage,
[Page 42]

Thou hold'st him forth, our country's guardian angel. Archbishop of Lisbon.
Look at his versatility and judge!
Examine well his principles, and view,
Cameleon like, for ever on the change.
To day his arms embrace the greasy mob,
He roars out freedom and fraternity:
To morrow, in the hour of exultation,
Contemns his brothers of equality;
Assumes the purple; mounts th' imperial throne;
And sways beneath the diadem he spurn'd.
Is this the base, is this the steady rock,
On which Reliance dares to fix its foot?
Slave of events, a feather whirl'd about,
The sport of every whiffling wind that blows. Alvarez.                                          [To Alonzo.
I can forgive a soldier's honest warmth,
Whose ardent bosom pants alone for glory;
Who loves his country, but not calmly views
[75]   The various turns of fickle Fortune's wheel.
Warm for my country's welfare beats my heart,
As warm as thine; but, mind me, less impetuous.
I would not hurl her headlong to destruction;
But by a gentle yielding, save a part.
Ev'n let us grant Napoleon is ambitious;
[Page 43]

Cannot Ambition then exist with Virtue?
Or, does it follow that th' aspiring plant
Must kill each flower that blooms beneath its shade?
I guess he wants not Virtue with his greatness;
Suspect not his sincerity untried. Archbishop of Lisbon.
The trial made, too late repentance comes;
The throne o'erturn'd, and Portugal enslav'd;
Our Prince in chains, our altars in the dust;
Religion scoff'd, and banish'd from the land;
What consolation will it then afford,
To say, we trusted to a hollow friend?
Did we not know him this, before we trusted?
Have we not seen him mock his God, and King?
To-day, a zealot in Religion's cause;
To-morrow, trampling on the holy cross;
One hour a Christian; one an Infidel!
What can be augur'd from his impious rule?
Confusion, strife, destruction of all order,
That makes the world, a howling wilderness.
[100]   What is the fame not built on Virtue's base?
Tell me, what is the splendor of a deed,
That flows not from true glory? not the sun's
That gives to nature, vigour, warmth, and life;
No!—but the skipping meteor's of a pool,
Misleading the benighted travellers;
A vapour from the sink of putrefaction.
[Page 44]
Alvarez.
Yet, is it wise to fly suspected evils,
And headlong rush on those which are too certain?
Weighs well my Prince the dangers of a voyage,
Distance, and changeful winds, and restless ocean?
His noble spirit dares encounter perils;
And, like the mountain oak, defy the storm:
But can the softer sex, unshaken brave
The warring elements? his lovely Princess,
Our Queen rever'd—the beauteous infant train,
The tender blossoms of parental love,
Will sink beneath the conflict, or at best
May, fading, droop beneath a scorching sun.
But should hard fate compel us to withdraw,
And quit those scenes so dear to every heart;
Yet let us linger to the latest moment,
And spare the pang of parting from our country. Prince.
Know that the latest moment is arriv'd!
The limed twigs are laid with subtle art;
[125]   Let us avoid them whilst our wings are free.
My Lords, the females of our royal House
Disdain the common weakness of the sex—
At dangers smile—the spirit of Braganza
Lives in their hearts, and dares whate'er is right;
Those infant blossoms which excite thy dread
Can only flourish where the soil is free.                                          [To Alv.
[Page 45]

Though for my babes I feel a father's kindness;
I feel a patriot ardour in my soul,
That bids me rather weep upon their tombs,
Where Freedom breathes, than see them live in pomp,
The mean appendage of tyrannic pride. Alonzo.
Our duty wants not eloquence to teach us—
Plain is the road; one choice is only ours,
Which claims attention, and demands dispatch.
Let us embrace the means which Heaven bestows. Prince.
I would our means were ample to convey
Our faithful people to a happier shore,
And leave the Despot to a desert soil.
Let us behold our loyal subjects blest,
And loss of luxury yields no regret;
To them, I owe my sceptre, nay, my all!
In their prosperity I boast my riches;
They form the pedestal on which I stand;
And when it crumbles from me, all is lost.
[150]   If with the Princes of the earth I rank,
'Tis from my people I derive my grandeur:
Their Majesty alone gives birth to mine. Archbishop of Braga.
Say, shall we crouch beneath the galling yoke;
Lament our bondage, like the captive sons
Of fall'n Judea , near Euphrates , swell'd
[Page 46]

With tears, when Zion was the mournful theme?—
Your wisdom rightly judges; let us fly,
O Prince ! and seek your western realms of peace;
There patient wait the gracious will of Heaven.
Ere long, I trust, our earth that mourns its fate,
May burst again in song. Methinks I see
The hand of Heaven stretch'd forth for our delivery,
To rid the world of the destroying spirit.
Prophetic, I behold his hour of fate;
I feel earth shake beneath the mighty fall
Of this Colossus that bestrides the world.
He, who rush'd forth, his breath a burning blast,
That scorch'd the fruits, and blossoms of the land;
He, whose unsated sword, with impious sweep,
Spread devastation; he, whose fiend-like voice
Howl'd 'midst the horrors of a ruin'd world,
And hurl'd defiance at th' Omnipotent,
Lies powerless; a mean piece of humble clay;
The scorn of every foot that deigns to tread it.
[175]   A remnant of thy people shall be sav'd;
More glorious to return; the iron bonds
Shall burst in sunder—desolation cease—
Our joyless city raise her drooping head,
And hymns of gladness fill her streets again. Alonzo.
Long has the groaning earth been drench'd with tears!
The voice of suffering Nature cries aloud;
[Page 47]

Chides sleeping Justice for her tame delay;
And bids her with the sword of vengeance arm,
To cleave the Monster in his mad career.
Where is the field that looks not grim with death;
Or herb, that blushes not with bloody tears?
This Nero wishes not for honest fame:
He scorns the virtues that would check Ambition;
And all his altars rise to Desolation. Emanuel.
Curse on the black Ambition which aspires
To rivet man in bondage; thief-like steal
The great palladium of our liberty;
Insulting, tread upon the neck of nations,
And bid the humbl'd vassals of his power
Live by his smile, or perish by his frown. Archbishop of Lisbon.
Hope whispers, Heaven not long permits his crimes!
Rais'd from obscurity the gaudy bubble,
Inflated by the breath of fools and flatterers,
Mounts for a minute's space, and melts in air.
[200]   The voice that sings a requiem to his soul
Will faulter in performance of its office;
The lonely wretch, who digs the hole to hide him,
Shrink from his spade and blush to yield him burial.
[Page 48]
Emanuel.
Waste not the precious moments in debate:
Our ships impatient wait, and spread the sail,
To catch th' auspicious breeze, which Heaven has breath'd;
As if to court us from the precipice,
The dangerous precipice that frowns beneath us.
Let fearful courtiers talk of boisterous seas;
Halcyons, that sport beneath a summer's sun;
Who, with a childish dread, pronounce all climes
Beset with dangers, which they ne'er explor'd.
The free-born spirit, fatal only deems,
That luckless region which engenders slavery.                                          [Shout without. Prince.
What means that shout?                                          [Enter a Messenger. Messenger.
My Liege , Lord Montford comes,
Ambassador from England —round him throng
The raptur'd populace, whose voice proclaims him
The true, th' unshaken friend of Portugal . Prince.
Admit him—he arrives in happy hour.                                          [Enter Montford. Montford.
O Prince ! for ever, be the care of Heaven,
[Page 49]

And may it pour its blessings on your head.
Once more, my royal master offers peace:
Extends to Portugal his friendly arm. Prince.
[225]   Thanks to the sovereign who supports our cause;
Who casts a lustre on the realm he rules:
Long have his virtues won our confidence.
Much we lament the hard necessity
That broke the bonds of union for awhile;
Yet, though we seem'd thy foe, our hearts, unchang'd,
Beheld thine Isle, the anchor of our hopes. Montford.
Nor will that anchor fail—no summer friends,
That only court beneath a smiling sky;
But, when the tempest blows, we dare the surge,
And fearless meet the fury of the storm.
Dangers surround your state—the insidious foe,
Ev'n at your gates, now clanks the threat'ning chain
See Ocean open to secure retreat;
And, lo! the naval power of Britain waits
To bear ye to her bosom, from oppression,
The fair asylum of th' unfortunate,
Or yield safe conduct to your Indian realms. Prince.
The generous zeal of England warms our hearts;
And, could we now forsake our distant realms,
[Page 50]

That calm retreat would meet our utmost wish.
All is prepar'd; and, ere the close of day,
We bid our native shores a long farewel.                                          [Noise without. Enter Bellegarde in a rage. Bellegarde.
Insidious Prince! I comprehend thee well:
Thy navy's loosen'd sails betray thy purpose. Prince.
[250]   What insolence! what means this daring speech?
We sought not meanly to conceal our purpose:
The sceptre yet is ours—we still can punish,
If prudence curb not thy licentious tongue:
We own no foreign Potentate's control. Bellegarde.
Prince , thou wilt curse the hour, the thoughtless hour,
When Portugal with Britain join'd in league.
That proud, that boastful, that imperious Isle,
Whose arrogance would lord it o'er the world,
And subjugate the nations to her will.
What are those Islanders that raise their crests
Self-fancied elder brothers of the skies?
[Page 51]
Montford.
Those haughty, and imperious Islanders,
That force the frothy venom from thy tongue,
(If pride be theirs) should glory in their pride,
Which breaks the galling fetters forg'd by France
To bind the arms of Freedom; to enslave
The sad, devoted victims of her hate,
Who vainly struggle for the rights of nature. Bellegarde.                                          [To the Prince.
Your bias, Sir, towards your British friends ,
As you have deign'd to call them, is well known;
And too well known, your rancour to Napoleon ,
Whose deeds of greatness and propitious star
Create him Europe's Master, Europe's Lord. Montford.
Bellegarde , thou wilt except one little Isle,
[275]   That to the power of France , disdains to yield;
And dreads no threaten'd vengeance of thy master. Bellegarde.
That little Isle must fall; the arm of might,
Which brought the Roman Eagle to the ground;
Can strip the plumage from a humbler bird.
France feels herself superior to defeat!
[Page 52]
Montford.
Vain boaster—hast thou then so soon forgot
The plains of Egypt ; where your glorying hosts,
Pronounc'd Invincibles, in terror fled;
The field resigning to a braver foe,
Out-number'd too by thousands in the conflict?
Were was the genius of all-conquering France ,
When suffering her Invincibles to fall,
And add another triumph to our arms
On Maida 's plain? Has Memory lost its power,
That thus thy speech of boastful arrogance,
Transforms defeat to splendid victory?
Are Britain 's naval sons so soon forgot,
Whose deeds posterity will scarce believe,
But deem the page of history mere romance? Bellegarde.
Know, Briton , know the genius of thine Isle,
Shall lower at last her haughty crest to France ,
To injur'd France —her fate is on its way. Montford.
England has long defied thy country's rage,
And foil'd its fierce attempts of subjugation.
[300]   Send forth your armies, that with threat'ning eye
Survey'd our kingdoms as an easy conquest.
What are your menaces?—a public jest.
Where your flotillas, fill'd with boastful bands?
[Page 53]

Behold the universal smile of Scorn,
Who marks them sunk or rotting on the beach.
The Majesty of Britain mocks thy menace,
And conscious of her dignity and power
Looks down contemptuous. Know those gallant men,
The brave, who fought at Agincourt and Cressy ,
Still fight the battles of our present wars:
Still flames their patriot spirit in their sons. Bellegarde.
Montford , thy nation's jealousy smells rank
Against the glory of the sons of Gaul.
In arms, in science, and the arts of life;
What are ye but the petty slaves of trade? Montford.
Those petty slaves of trade are sons of Liberty.
Each Briton is a soldier—when his arm
Is claim'd to vindicate his country's wrongs,
Nor age nor youth refuse the post of danger.
They shrink not from the charge when Freedom calls;
Nor shrink they from the vengeance of Napoleon :
That vengeance will recoil upon yourselves;
Mad, like the roaring surge that strikes the brow
Of some high promontory, vents its rage,
[325]   And broken, falls repell'd in fruitless foam.
Your pardon, Prince , but yonder vaunting Gaul
Provokes my spirit to contemn his boasts.
[Page 54]
Bellegarde.
Let me intreat the Regent 's confidence;
My royal Master promises protection. Alonzo.
What, trust, my Liege , the clemency of France ,
And place your safety in Napoleon 's hands!
The cherub Mercy dwells not in his heart;
Witness the field of Jaffa , where the band,
A captive band, were slaughter'd in cold blood—
Where Murder 's self turn'd pale upon the deed.
Witness the sad companions of his toils,
His wounded brethren, who, in hospitals
Besought the balm, receiv'd the pois'nous draught. Alvarez.
Trust me, my Prince , the tongue of Calumny
Would cast a shade upon Napoleon 's virtues. Alonzo.
Alvarez , cease, or I shall call thee traitor.
Praise of this man is incense to a fiend!
Thy speeches are apologies for vice;
Thy ready eloquence would varnish crimes,
And give the strength of steel to rottenness.
Suspicion with a cautious eye must watch thee.
[Page 55]
Alvarez.
Thy words of air, Alonzo , wound me not,
Whilst safe I hold my Prince's confidence. Bellegarde.
Napoleon scatters blessings on his way! Montford.
[350]   If famine, tyranny, and wounds, and death;
The cries of orphans, and the widow's moans,
That sadden every wind that blows, be blessings,
Napoleon blesses with a bounteous hand. Bellegarde.
Thou wear'st a sword— Montford.
A sword of British temper,
Disdaining rest; when honour calls it forth. Bellegarde.
Vain flourish!— Montford.
Can a flourish then offend,
Which forms the essence of a Frenchman's soul?
[Page 56]
Bellegarde.
The time may come, thou may'st repent this outrage;
A Frenchman bears not insult with impunity.                                          [Laying his hand on his sword. Montford.
Let the time come, and I will welcome it. Prince.
Sirs, this is not the place for altercation;
Affairs of moment now demand our thoughts:
Fix'd is our great resolve; and nought remains,
Nought, but our instant mandate for departure. Bellegarde.
Then tremble at the vengeance of our arms.                                          [Exit. Enter a Messenger hastily, presenting a letter to the Prince, who, after the perusal, delivers it to Alonzo. Prince.
Alvarez , we have weigh'd thy counsels well;
But search thy heart, and tell us, is thy faith
Built on experience of Napoleon 's virtues?
And holdest thou thy Sovereign's safety dear;
When thou would'st bid us trust his clemency?
Alvarez dumb! Where is that patriot flame
[Page 57]

Which lately flush'd thy cheek? Why now so pale?
[375]   What can produce such sudden change of colour?
Perhaps thou knowest the hand that stain'd this paper.
Thy features stamp thy guilt—more proof is needless.
Alvarez , is it thus?—canst thou betray;
Thou , who from infancy hast read my heart;
And to thy Prince, were e'en a second self?
We ask not now disclosure from thy tongue;
Thy alter'd eye proclaims the damning tale.
Art thou the column of my confidence,
On which my friendship rested—nay, my throne!
My life too—nay, the life of Portugal !
Astonishment so seizes on my sense,
I almost think thy treason is a dream.
Guards! 2 take him hence. My Lords, our time is precious. 3
[Page 58]
ACT IV. SCENE I. —A Prison. Alvarez solus, sitting. Alvarez.
How am I fall'n!—this morn, this very morn,
I saw a crown descending on my head;
The realm of Portugal beneath my sway;
The fair Elvira 's beauties in my arms:
And now, behold a dungeon's dreary round
Clouds all my hopes of greatness, and presents
The grin of Death, instead of Fortune's smiles;
The blood-stain'd wheel and hisses of the mob,
Instead of joyful, loyal acclamation;
The iron fetter for the golden sceptre;
The scaffold for the throne: such is the fruit,
The fatal fruit, of false and mad ambition.
Oh! what a change!—but, shall these iron bonds
Insult captivity?—shall the tongue of Scorn,
Opprobrious, wound me in my way to death?
[Page 59]

Avaunt the thought!—this phial shall prevent.—
Welcome thou friendly opiate of my woes;
Pass a few pangs, and Misery stings no more.
Thou friendly phial, in thy little sphere
I see a world of sorrows hush'd to peace:
A tempest lull'd to everlasting calm.                                          [Drinks.                                          [Enter Elvira.
Elvira ! and with insult too I guess,
To wound the wretch thy falshood has betray'd.
Speak out, and triumph in thy victim's chains:
[25]   Chains not so hard and galling as thy treachery. Elvira.
Alvarez , thou mistak'st Elvira 's purpose. Alvarez.
Speak, owe I not those fetters to thy tongue?
What hast thou done? Elvira.
My duty to my Prince—
My duty to my country—which out-weighs
The love I bore thee once, but feel no more.
Alvarez , if repentance be a wound,
I wish indeed to pierce thy inmost soul.
I come not to insult thee, but to mourn.
Yet, 'midst my tears, I feel one consolation,—
Thy life is safe—thy life the Prince has granted:
Live, and repent thee in some distant land:
[Page 60]

My sighs shall follow thee where'er thy way.
I thought thy breast with patriot virtue burn'd,
Too proud, too honest, to become a dupe
Of one, whose varnish'd subtleties and crimes,
Pretending to embrace the pedestals
Of Virtue, Glory, Liberty, and Truth,
Sapp'd their foundations and enjoy'd their fall.
But let me cease reproach—my bosom bleeds
Whilst thus I harrow thine—my once lov'd friend
Adieu, adieu—we part to meet no more.                                          [Going. Alvarez.
Elvira , have I lost thee then for ever?
Yield a few moments to thy parting friend:
[50]   To thee, let me confess my guilt and weakness:
A mad Ambition and too stern a Pride,
Have been the dire seducers of my heart;
These, these have led Alvarez' feet astray:—
I thought Elvira might become a Queen. Elvira.
Thou knowest then but little of Elvira —
Perish the deed that bears ingratitude—
Think of the virtues of our gracious Prince—
Think of the countless favors of his hand,
So often shower'd upon my scanty merits;
Could such a friend be mine, and I behold
That friend surrounded with a host of dangers,
And stretch not forth a grateful hand to save him?
[Page 61]
Alvarez.
Oh! had I sooner laid my heart before thee,
I had not thus been dup'd by Gallic wiles;
I had not been a traitor to my Prince;
That Prince, which Treason now beholds with shame:
I had not stood, as now, upon the brink
Of dread eternity: weigh'd down with crimes,
I shrink to take the dark advent'rous leap.
Oh! I am sick, Elvira , sick at heart. Elvira.
What hidden meaning lurks within thy words?
Why tremblest thou? Why hang upon thy brow
Those chilly drops, as though the dews of death?
Whence is the cause? Oh! speak. Alvarez.
[75]   Within the hour
Thine eye will view Alvarez a pale corpse;
Far from the aspic tongue of Calumny,
Far from th' ambitious tumults of the world;
What more severely wounds, far, far from thee.
That phial can inform thee of a deed
Which draws th' eternal veil 'twixt thee and me. Elvira.
Help, help—who waits there.                                          [Enter Attendants.
[Page 62]
Alvarez.
Stay, Elvira , stay;
Thy friend is now beyond the reach of art:
Waste not the precious moments which remain.
Elvira , plead my pardon with the Prince :
Say, thou beheld'st a penitent; yet say,
In kind extenuation of my crime,
That Treach'ry spread her wiles, her subtlest wiles,
To win me from allegiance, and prevail'd.
Elvira , tho' the victim, I forgive thee;
Yet, how can I accuse; the film remov'd,
Which Prejudice had on my eye diffus'd,
I see thee rise exalted o'er thy sex,
And, from the action, deem thee more sublime:
And now to lose thee—thus to part for ever
Is Nature's hardest trial: give thy hand—
This hand that bless'd me I shall press no more;
That form, which made me happy, view no more;
[100]   That voice, which charm'd me, I shall hear no more.
May every blessing, Heaven can grant, be thine.
And should'st thou to this hapless realm return,
And wander near to where Alvarez lies,
A little sigh—a little tear from thee
Will sooth my spirit, and embalm my tomb.
Thou Great Omnipotent ! look down, look down
With pity on the frailties of humanity:
Forgive me, that I rush into thy presence
Unbidden—cast, Oh! cast me not away:
[Page 63]

But wherefore doubt thee? let me not despair;
Unlimited, thy mercies like thy power,
Surpass the boundaries of mortal thought.
Receive thou then a poor, repentant spirit,
Nor quench the spark of that ethereal flame
Which flows from thee, and shows the Deity.                                          [Dies. Elvira faints, and falls into the arms of the Attendants, by whom she is led off. SCENE II. —The City of Lisbon. On the Side of the Stage the Portico of the Royal Palace, from whence proceed the Prince, Princess, Royal Children ; Elvira, Emilia, Alonzo ; Counsellors of State, Attendants, and Guards, on their way for Embarkation.—Near them appear numerous Inhabitants of Lisbon, who press forward towards the Royal Family: Alonzo beckons to the Guards to make them retire. Prince.
Restrain not, good Alonzo , thus my people;
They come with kind affection in their hearts—
We dread no treason here—their tearful eyes
Bespeak a loyalty, and grief unfeign'd:
We want not guards amid our faithful subjects:
[Page 64]

Let tyrants build their safety on the sword;
We rest secure upon a firmer base,
Our people's love—that love we hold more dear
Than Empire's self, and all the pomp of power;
The brightest jewel in the diadem.
Mourn not my friends, we part to meet again.
We seek a distant realm, where Portugal
Shall, free from tempests, raise her head sublime,
And form a sure asylum for us all.
My precious babes, whose unexperienc'd minds                                          [To the Children.
Feel not the cares and sorrows of the world;
Oh! may ye thus remain till happier times.
Farewel my native country!—Oh! farewel!
But let my soul indulge the pleasing hope;
The hope, that after some short lapse of time,
I shall revisit thee, and see thee smile,
Freed from th' Oppressor's hand. Just Heaven may break,
Ere long, thy chains, and raise thy drooping head.
Where'er my fate shall force me, thou, my country,
[25]   Shalt live in every thought: on thee at morn,
On thee at latest night, shall Mem'ry dwell
In tender sympathy on thy distress.
Once more, my country, let me sigh “farewel!”
[Page 65]
ACT V. SCENE I. —A Street near the City Gate. Bellegarde, Girronde, Larron , and Conspirators . Bellegarde.
Ha ! sayest thou, Girronde , the Prince embarks? Girronde.
The spacious beach is hid beneath the croud
Of every rank that presses for departure.
Nobles and Priests, Plebeians, Soldiers mix;
An eager multitude to join his flight;
Whilst the griev'd populace, to mark their feelings,
Shower execration on the Tyrant's head,
Who forces into banishment their Princes;
Yet hail their broken chains with exultation. Bellegarde.
Perdition seize the Briton's tongue that pour'd
Its damned poison in the Prince's ear!
[Page 66]

But let me not despair—a ray of hope
Remains—our armies almost touch the gates.
This day, perchance, may view him in our bonds
A humble slave, and yield my soul a triumph.
Then, if that Briton 'scapes to tell his tale,
The mournful hist'ry of his just defeat,
Shade of immortal Robespiere , whose cause                                          [Flourishing his sword.
This blade supported, may'st thou ne'er forgive me.
Mercy avaunt!—if well I know myself,
Revenge has never slept upon this arm.
Enter thy scabbard, but prepare thy point,
For deeds of mightier horror at my call. Enter a Messenger . Messenger.
My Lord, your friend Alvarez is no more;
[25]   An intercepted letter for your hand
Condemn'd him to a dungeon, where he drank
The draught of death. Bellegarde.
No matter, all is well—
Nothing is lost—we want the fool no more—
It takes off teazing importunity;
Cancels the tedious debt of Gratitude:
We hold a number of such worthy friends,
[Page 67]

And should be pleas'd to see our promises
Fulfill'd by such a passage to the grave.
Feeble the fibres of his resolution;
A prop not to be trusted—a weak beam—
The rot had caught it; and Elvira 's beauties
Had sapp'd his firmness by her fascinations.
But wherefore linger thus the troops of France ,
That should have borrow'd fleetness from the winds?
Curse on their tardy feet; they only come
To stand spectators of our hope's defeat.
Each Gallic soldier with a throne in view
Should be a Mercury—but, hark!—they come—
Now swells my soul again with lofty hope!                                          [Drums beating a march. The advanced guard of the French army enter and pass over the Stage. Enter Junot the General of the French. Bellegarde.
In lucky minute thou appear'st my friend—
This minute may arrest their enterprize. Enter another Messenger . Messenger.
Hasten your troops, my Lords, or all is lost.
Already is their navy on its way—
[50]   A moment's interval may mar your hopes.
[Page 68]
Junot.
Who guides our march? Bellegarde.
Myself will lead the way—
Braganza yet may be within my reach.                                          [Exeunt in haste. Troops continue for some time to pass over the Stage. SCENE II. Discovers a View of the Tagus . The Portuguese Fleet under sail, beyond the several Forts; toward which, the French Troops are seen marching.—The shores crouded with spectators, those nearest the front of the Stage sing the following Ode .—The British Squadron appear in the distance, advancing to join the Navy of Portugal .—At the conclusion of the Ode the two Fleets fire a Royal Salute.
[Page 69]
[Spectators.] ODE.

Beyond the Tyrant 's grasp of power,
   Whose deeds the page of hist'ry stain;
Thy subjects hail the happy hour,
   That frees thee from the galling chain.

Farewel for ever!—o'er the deep,
   Thou wanderest with a Nation 's sighs;
A Nation , that thy loss will weep,
   And tell thy fate with streaming eyes.

Yet, why for thee our sorrows flow,
   Who seekest Freedom through the waves;
Disdain'st in vassalage to bow,
   And join the band of sceptred slaves.

O'er His , how nobly towers thy name,
   Whose steps the fiend-like Furies lead;
Who courts from Infamy a fame,
   And lives upon the murder'd dead. CHORUS.
Go, Prince , and may th' auspicious wind
   Conduct thy virtues to that sphere,
Where dove-ey'd Peace may calm thy mind,
   That feels a storm of troubles here. Back matter

PROLOGUE. [By Taylor, Mr.] By Mr. TAYLOR.
“ Fashion in every thing bears sov'reign sway,”—
Says the gay record of a peaceful day,
And still, though dread convulsions shake the Ball,
Before her throne conflicting nations fall.
Howe'er they else may differ, each agrees
In full accord with her august decrees;
Decrees she changes with the passing wind,
Yet all in turn a prompt obedience find,
E'en Britain , that all other force disdains,
Submits to her caprice, and courts her chains.
Shall then a Bard with rash presumption tow'r,
And dare rebel 'gainst her imperial pow'r!
Yes—let the subject world the sway confess
Of this wild Tyrant o'er the realms of dress,
But let her baleful licence ne'er annoy
The sacred confines of domestic joy;
Ne'er tempt the husband wayward chance to try,
Where Ruin hovers o'er the fatal die;
Or, wrapt in Gallantry's alluring 'guise,
The slighted wife's unguarded hour surprise;
When Fashion thus employs her direful art,
To warp the passions, and pollute the heart,
The scenic Muse her empire should disown,
Indignant rise, and pull her from her throne;
And hence our zealous Bard, no stranger here,
Attempts to check her in her mad career:
Well may he hope to gain in such a cause,
What oft before has cheer'd him, your applause.
Then aid his effort for so just an end,
And Fashion may appear as Virtue's friend;
So shall your kindness lead our rising youth
To honest Nature, and to simple Truth.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. —A romantic country—large cotton manufactory. Canal, with wheels in motion occupying the fore-ground—a gentleman's house in the distance—In the back-ground a mountain.—Porters are carrying bales of cotton. Enter Trot, Armstrong , and Dwindle , from Compting-house. Trot. Let me see—goods sent by canal— very fine order indeed—By waggon, capital— now, Armstrong, when I'm in London, (where I am going, heaven knows against my will) I shall rely on your activity and care.—
1st Clerk . Will you? You had better not; I'm sure when you are gone, I sha'n't be half so careful, nor half so honest.
Trot. You won't?
1st Clerk . No, nor will any of us.
Trot. That's candid however.
Arm. Now you are with us, every morning
[Page 2]
we hear you say, well done, my worthy fellows, and that does our hearts good; and then we say, long life to Mr. Trot, our worthy master, and that does your heart good.
Dwin. Perhaps, Sir, your wife wishes to go to London, and if so—
Trot. That's it.
Arm. Then, why leave us, Sir?
Trot. I hardly know how to make you comprehend. You are not married, Armstrong, are you?
Arm. Oh, no, Sir. (Jumping up with vivacity.)
Trot. [25]   Well, dam' it, you need not jump so. You can stand still, I suppose tho' you are not married. You are Dwindle?
Dwin. Oh, yes, Sir.
Trot. You see how quietly he behaves.— I say, explain it to him—You know the old excuses—weaker sex—pleasure of pleasing— nervous sensibility—quiet life—smoky chimney — (Apart to Dwindle.)
Dwin. Oh yes, Sir, I know.—
Trot. There, go, go,—I'll follow you to the compting-house.                                          (Exeunt clerks.) Enter Robin , with two parcels. What have you there, Robin?
Robin. This, Sir, contains a gross of gentlemen's cravats.
Trot. And the small one?
Robin. The same number of ladies' dresses, Sir.—
Trot. Ha, ha! go along—you are a queer fellow, Robin.

[Page 3]
Robin. Here's a chaise, Sir.
Trot. Oh, I suppose somebody coming to pay me a large sum.
Robin. Four horses.
Trot. That's more like somebody coming to borrow. Why 'tis my son-in-law, Charles [50]   Plastic.—Run and tell my wife— (Exit Robin. He has come from London, happy fellow! but I'm going to it. Enter Plastic . Ah, Charles, I'm glad to see you.
Plas. Thank you. Well father-in-law, how are the extensive works, the machinery, and— my mother?
Trot. Why, the water-wheels, the spinning-jenny's and your mother twirl about pretty brisk; and make about as much noise as usual. And how is your health, Charles?
Plas. Low.
Trot. Your purse?
Plas. Empty.
Trot. Ah! all occasioned by neglecting my advice.
Plas. All occasioned by following it.
Trot. Come that must be a glorious falsehood.
Plas. A most humiliating truth—For proof now,—your first admonition to me was—never tamely to submit to an insult.
Trot. To be sure.
Plas. I resented the first I receiv'd,—and had a bullet lodged in this shoulder, which I am told, will plague me all my life.

[Page 4]
Trot. [75]   Well, but did you obey my next instruction, never to let a friend in distress want assistance.
Plas. Religiously.
Trot. Well, and the consequence was—
Plas. That I went to jail instead of my friends, and had the felicity of leaning my cheek against the iron bars, and see them drive past in their curricles, so full of feeling, kind souls, they could not lift up their eyes to behold the man who had put the reins in their hands.— No, no,—your Utopian theory won't assimilate with Bond Street practice; a man must now wear his understanding, as he does his clothes, according to the last new fashion—So, behold Charles Plastic, no longer called a dupe; but, by the assent of the whole town, the best fellow in the world—
Trot. The best fellow in the world! But how did you contrive to make every body so delighted with you?
Plas. Simply by making every one delighted with himself:—ingeniously withdrawing my opinion to make room for that of others; and raising the laugh against myself, and by that means [100]   preventing the rest of the world from doing so,—and thus the best fellow in the world may either play the devil with impunity, or have credit for practising the cardinal virtues, without even knowing their names—But where's my lady mother all this while? Oh she's here.
Enter Mrs. Trot . Mrs. T. My dear Charles—Well, is all prepared? —the new London house?—

[Page 5]
Plas. Is nique, splendid and capacious; and at your command, its doors, like flood-gates, will open and receive the full tide of fashion.
Mrs. T. Charming—let us away!
Trot. But I don't know the fashionable folks in London, except some in the cotton line.
Plas. My dear Sir, don't be uneasy: formerly indeed, recruiting for stylish connections, was a tedious, regular service; but, now, only open a new house, and you raise friends, as the French did soldiers, en masse , egad!
Trot. Then I think in the present age of depravity, if my house must be a rendezvous for fashionable recruits, it would not be amiss to give notice that bringers of good men will be handsomely rewarded.
Mrs. T. [125]   How vulgar? but I deserve it, for descending from my family dignity, and marrying one of, what I may call, the lower house.
Trot. Why, certainly, my dear, I may be said to belong to the house that furnishes the supplies.
Mrs. T. That's a very good joke.
Trot. Yes, and not at your expense.
Mrs. T. Expense! Did not my family (the ancient family of the Plastic's) in their election contests with Sir Cardigan Somers, absolutely throw into the dirt a hundred thousand pounds?
Trot. Well, but you know that's all over.
Mrs. T. And were not you a little plodding creature, happy and contented?
Trot. Well, but that's all over.
Mrs. T. And was not I young—beautiful—

[Page 6]
Trot. Well, but that's all over.
Mrs. T. What! But I see how it is—you wish to lacerate my heart—to break my tender thread of life.
Trot. Don't say so, my dear—tender thread! Dam'me, 'tis double twill'd! (Apart.)
Enter Robert , Mrs. Glenroy's servant, in a travelling Dress. Robert. The Honourable Mrs. Glenroy, on her way to London, begs to pay her compliments.
Mrs. T. [150]   Happy to see her.
                                         [Exit Robt. Plas. Ah, my lovely pupil—the divine Honoria!—related, Madam, to our house.
Mrs. T. True, the daughter of Lord Moulder: —Imprudently married, I hear.
Plas. Oh, no; I advised her to marry Glenroy—an intimate friend of mine.
Mrs. T. Who is he?
Plas. Faith I scarcely know who he is; but he's a fine fellow, a captain, and all that, and she's a fine creature, and ought to be brought among us, and all that.
Mrs. T. She has no fortune—has he money?
Plas. I should think not a guinea; but I dare say they will come through pretty well this winter, which is as long as the most foresighted of us look to—we must start them—then they'll turn into the ranks and so forth.
Trot. And then turn into a jail, and so forth.
                                         [Goes up the stage. Plastic exit and hands in Mrs. Glenroy .
[Page 7]
Mrs. G. Well, you good creature, you see I've kept my promise; but, do you know, I believe I am a very vulgar woman.
Plas. Why, keeping a promise is, I own, [175]   symptomatic.
Mrs. G. No, no, not that; but just now I went into a cottage, and kissed all the handsome, dirty, little angels, and gave the woman a guinea. How she stared! I hope it was not out of taste—they seemed so happy—heigh ho!
Plas. A tear!
Mrs. G. There,—I know I am an abominably vulgar wretch—I want to see my husband, and my child.—
Plas. The devil you do! (Apart.) Oh, fie! fie! Upon my honour, if this should get into the parties, you'll be absolutely left out.
Mrs. G. Oh, don't say so. For, though I have not the least pleasure at them, yet to be left out! horrible idea!—
Plas. Dreadful!
Mrs. G. What a good soul you are to guide me, or how easily might a young creature like me, be deluded by the charms of nature, and the joys of a happy home!—
Plas. Very true; but I must introduce you, Madam—the Honourable Mrs. Glenroy.
Mrs. T. Related to our house.
Mrs. G. Proud of that honour.
Plas. [200]   Mr. Trot, my father-in-law.
Trot. Occasioned by my marrying his mother.
Mrs. G. Ha, ha! a very satisfactory explanation. What a beautiful country I have
[Page 8]
pass'd.—The view from the mountain absolutely petrified me.
Trot. Petrified! Ma'am, I can shew you a petrified wig, occasioned—
Mrs. T. My poor little man has not much fancy.—But may I ask, who is the person you have introduced to our family as your husband?
Mrs. G. A captain in the army, Madam: of course a gentleman.
Mrs. T. But is his family ancient?—What is his coat?
Mrs. G. Scarlet, Madam.
Mrs. T. I mean, what does he quarter?
Mrs. G. The enemies of his country, Madam.
Mrs. T. You will not understand.—Has he any supporters?
Mrs. G. Only these arms, Madam.
Trot. Pretty soul!
Mrs. T. Your parents ought to have provided a man of family.
Mrs. G. Oh, they did.
Mrs. T. [225]   Sufficiently ancient?
Mrs. G. He was Sixty-seven.
Mrs. T. Settlements made?
Mrs. G. Oh, every thing was prepared that could make a parent happy, or a daughter miserable. Parchment enough to drape Westminster Hall, where every fracture in the conjugal chain was provided against; even to the solder of separate maintenance for personal infidelity.—But no, I took the man of my heart, proudly spurning those alliances, where all is fairly engrossed, but the affections, and every thing duly stampt, except an impression
[Page 9]
on the heart. But come, Charles, you good creature, shew the lions; for my limbs are cramped by that odious chaise, to a degree.—
Mrs. T. Will you make one in our carriage to London? but, as you please; for my maxim is,—that every one should do just as they like.—Mr. Trot, your old attitude again. (Angrily.) —Ease and the spirit of accommodation is every thing. Mr. Trot and I always ride with the glasses down, and face the horses.
Trot. Occasioned by long habits of driving a whiskey. But won't you take a corner in our [250]   coach?
Mrs. G. Why, Sir, you surely won't keep a coach.—
Trot. What must I keep?
Mrs. G. Any thing but a coach.—Even a barouche is antiquated.—Look into Bondstreet, and you will see two fashionable puppies in a dog-cart,—half a dozen elegantes in a fish-cart, and a dashing whip, smiling as he smoaks along, though he has his whole family behind him in an eccentric vehicle, he calls a hearse, ha! ha! But come, Charles—good bye.
Mrs. T. What a favourite Charles is!
Mrs. G. Oh, he's the best creature in the world; for he lets one laugh at him; and his good natured prattle is like the confectioners' mottos, full of point, yet always surrounded with sugar.
                                         [Exit with Plastic. Trot. Pretty soul.
Enter Robin and Goody Hawbuck . Robin. Goody Hawbuck wants you, Sir.

[Page 10]
Mrs. T. Some other time. Your arm, Mr. Trot.
Trot. What's the matter?
Robin. She says she is in distress.—May she [275]   speak to you?
Trot. You say she's in distress?
Robin. Yes Sir.
Trot. Then why ask unnecessary questions. —Come here! (Beckons to Goody Hawbuck.) What's amiss?
G. Haw. I wish to speak to your honour about my son Jacky: but I'm ashamed to trouble—
Trot. Trouble! Nonsense! Come, be quick!
G. Haw. I will, your honour. I sent Jacky to a Yorkshire school, to get a learned iddication, that he might provide for us all; but lack-a-day! Jacky has brought nought wi him from Yorkshire, but Latin; and, instead of keeping us, we are forced to keep him. So, as he is not fit for any thing, I thought your good honour would take him into your service.
Trot. A very strong recommendation, certainly.
Mrs. T. The familiarity of these people is unbearable.—
Trot. Why, my dear, there is but one way of making these miserables keep at a proper distance from us.
Mrs. T. [300]   And what may that be?
Trot. By making misery keep at a proper distance from them. Go, and bring your boy up to the house.
Mrs. T. That's right—encourage paupers.

[Page 11]
Trot. I encourage them! On the contrary, my dear, I detest them so abominably, that I never see a pauper without endeavouring to prevent his being one; and did others feel the same sort of hate, who knows but in time, the wretches might be exterminated. (He leads out Mrs. Trot, beckoning to Goody Hawbuck, who follows .
SCENE II. —An Apartment in Trot's House. Enter Trot , followed by Goody Hawbuck . Trot. Well, well; where is he? Where is this boy of your's?
G. Haw. He's here at the door, your honour. —Jacky, my dear babe, come in. Enter Hawbuck . Now speak to the gentleman.
Haw. Salve domine!
Trot. What?
Haw. Salve domine!
Trot. Oh, very likely. What does he say?
Goody. That's Latin.
Haw. Yes; as much as to say, how is't tha, mun?—
Trot. How is't tha, mun—why, zounds! his English is as unintelligible as his Latin.
Goody. Oh, poor babe! I'm sure your honour will employ him; for you see how helpless he is.
Trot. What the devil shall I do with him. Oh! now I recollect,—In London I must keep
[Page 12]
a number of useless servants, and he seems remarkably well qualified for being one.
Hawb. I should not wonder if I was best in the whole bunch.
Trot. [25]   Well, you may leave him.
Goody. Heaven bless and preserve you!
Trot. Go, go, you are a generous old soul.
Goody. I generous! Heaven help me, your honour means grateful.
                                         [Exit. Trot. True, true; but the mistake is not very material; for those, who feel the spirit of gratitude, in receiving a kindness, only want an opportunity to display the spirit of generosity in bestowing one.
Enter Plastic . Plas. Scoundrel!
Trot. What's the matter, Charles?
Plas. I've just discharged an impertinent servant.
Trot. A stupid dog, I dare say.
Plas. No, no, a shrewd, clever, capable rascal, —prying into my affairs—knowing more of me, than I do of myself.—Oh, for a fine thick-headed dog!
Trot. I think I can suit you—I say, look there. (Pointing to Hawb.)
Plas. There is some promise in his face, I own.
Trot. Try him. Come hither.—I want you. (To Hawbuck.)
Hawb. [50]   Want me already, do you? Ecod, this will be no such easy place, I see.
Trot. This gentleman wishes to hire you.

[Page 13]
Hawb. Does he. Who is he?
Trot. He's a man of fashion, and a wit.
Hawb. A what—a wit? (Snapping his fingers.) That's just what I wanted to see.— Never saw a wit in all my days.
Trot. No?
Hawb. No.—Why, you be'n't one?
Trot. Not absolutely; occasionally smart, very smart indeed; but not—
Hawb. No, I thought you did not look like it.
Trot. Ha! ha! My dear Charles, I think I may venture to recommend him, as the most stupid dog in Europe, without the least risk of incurring the penalty of the statute for giving a false character.
                                         [Exit. Hawb. A wit! I declare, 'tis quite awful, I wonder what clever thing he'll say first. (Puts himself in an affected attitude.)
Plas. Who are you?
Hawb. That's damn'd keen— however, I'll pluck up.—Why, I be Jacky Hawbuck.
Plas. Oh!
Hawb. [75]   Oh! Capital!—That has quite knocked me up. Oh!
Plas. Where do you come from?
Hawb. Don't you flurry me, that's not fair. (Pertly.) Why, I come fra' Yorkshire.
Plas. What doing there?
Hawb. I were at school.
Plas. Aye! and what did you learn?
Hawb. Latin.
Plas. What?
Hawb. Latin.

[Page 14]
Plas. Latin—ha, ha, ha,
Hawb. Yes, Latin, he! he! he! I say, devilish smart on both sides, I think,—he! he!
Plas. Oh, very.
Hawb. Then, gi'us thy hand on't—par nobile fratrem, as we scholards say. Dam' it, I shall do.
Plas. Ha, ha! But what wages do you expect?
Hawb. Why, I've had a most capital idication. —Cost mother poaks-full of money.— Wad you think it?—Eleven pounds a year.
Plas. Incredible!
Hawb. Aye, but stop a bit;—that were for Latin and logic, and leather breeches—all in a [100]   lump, you understand.
Plas. Suppose, then, I double the sum it cost your mother for Latin and logic.
Hawb. Sufficet. But— (holding out his hand.)
Plas. What do you mean by that?
Hawb. Why, mother paid som'it for entrance like.
Plas. Well, there's a guinea.—Now, don't be always dangling after me.—
Hawb. I'll never come near you.
Plas. Nor listen to overhear my conversation.
Hawb. I'll never mind a word you say.
Plas. Your name is John?
Hawb. Mother always called me Jacky. I think Jacky's prettier, and more brotherly and suitable between us, like.
Plas. Ha! ha! Well, then Jacky, your servant.
                                         [Exit.
[Page 15]
Hawb. Why now, that's very civil; for I thought I was to be his servant; but, however, if he likes t'other way best, I've no objections.
Door-bell rings.— Cosey , (without.) Cosey. Hey, within there! Nobody at home—Hollo!
Hawb. Pratty set of sarvants in this house.—Nothing to do, and yet let a gentleman [125]   stand at the door in that manner—oh, 'tis too bad, a great deal.
                                         [Exit on the opposite side. Enter Cosey and Postillion . Cosey. Why, zounds, the house is as empty as the Bank on a holiday!—There's your commission, and be at the door again in two hours.—Mind, you've to transfer into the next county.—Won't coach it in the dark—no lamps here.
                                         (Exit postillion. Why, where is the old boy? I must give him one of our Change-alley calls.—Peter Trot!— Peter Trot!
Enter Trot . Trot. Heyday! who is making this uproar?
Cosey. What, have you forgot Kit Cosey? How are you?
Trot. Why, is it possible.—My old friend Cosey, two hundred miles from London?
Cosey. Business, my dear fellow, or you
[Page 16]
don't suppose I could have done such a damn'd silly thing.—
Trot. I thought the travels of the lamp-lighter always terminated your's.
Cosey. Why, I have no objections to short country excursions, there's such a pleasure in thinking they'll so soon be over. Often take a trip to Muddy Paradise, the seat of Alderman [150]   Greasy. Lonesome, but very rural, stands all alone by itself, in the fields behind Islington.
Trot. Well, but I hope you enjoyed this journey.
Cosey. Amazingly.—Slept all the way.
Trot. A very wonderful country that I live in.
Cosey. Very wonderful that you live in it, indeed. Lord! Lord! to compare this place to Lunnun. Here your great sprawling, lolloping clown rolls about like a lump of lead;— there your dapper, agreeable, compact cockney, skips about like a bit of quicksilver.—Only see them at a city hop—capering and bumping their heads against the ceiling, as jollily as e'er a shepherd that ever play'd upon a fiddle. But I say, old boy you seem cruelly altered; when I saw you last, you were as brisk as bank stock; but you now seem cut down to short annuity.—What's the matter?
Trot. I'm grown rich.
Cosey. Why, I'm warmish; but yet, I am what I call comfortable.
Trot. Ah, but I am so rich, that I must leave my dear spinning jenny's, and be happy [175]   in London.

[Page 17]
Cosey. That's the place!—give you joy old Trot.
Trot. Then I'm married.
Cosey. Oh—beg pardon—forgot that.— Well, I long to see your choice—when you open'd that joint account, you wrote in raptures about her.
Trot. Did I? you have a most excellent memory; for that must have been a long time ago.
Cosey. Oh, Cupid's at a discount.
Trot. Why, the keenest edge will wear a little blunt. I don't think she is quite so handsome—
Cosey. You praised her blushes.
Trot. But now they are apt to come in the wrong place.
Cosey. Alabaster complexion—
Trot. Yes, but like my inferior muslins— washing makes it change colour—Mum! (Seeing Mrs. Trot.) Enter Mrs. Trot, Mrs. Glenroy and Plastic . My dear, allow me to introduce Mr. Cosey from London.
Mrs. T. Come to enjoy the pure air of the country?
Cosey. [200]   Yes, Ma'am, very pure; but I don't think it has much taste with it.
Mrs. T. Taste!
Cosey. Why, you know, Ma'am, the Lunnun air has a kind of a sootish sort of a smack, that I think gives it a flavour—I like it— don't you Miss.

[Page 18]
Trot. Miss—No such person—occasioned by her marrying Captain Glenroy.
Cosey. What, the son of Owen Glenroy, the Welch parson?
Mrs. G. The same, Sir.
Cosey. Then, Ma'am, you and I are, what I call, cousins.—Going to Wales to see your father-in-law, take any little parcel.
Mrs. G. Oh, I think I recollect—you are somebody in the city.
Cosey. Why yes, in the city I flatter myself I am somebody, and insignificant as I may appear here, I can tell you, that when I quitted the bank yesterday morning, I did not leave a greater bear in it than myself. 'Tis as well to let them know who they've got among them. You must know my reason for going into Wales is, that I have bought the estate which formerly [225]   belonged to Sir Cardigan Somers.
Plas., Trot. & Mrs. T. You!
Cosey. Oh I've got into an enemy's country here.—Yes, I—
Mrs. T. But why!
Cosey. A whim!
Trot. Why, I was told it sold for five thousand more than its value.
Cosey. A whim.
Plas. Oh, what's a handful of thousands to a purse-proud citizen?
Cosey. Umph! (Apart.) Now that puppy Plastic owes me five hundred pounds. Sir as you are pleased to put me in mind how city pride is pampered by the thousands we gain;
[Page 19]
pray, be just enough to remember, that charity is fed by the thousands we give.
Trot. The castle commands a delightful prospect.
Cosey. A good look-out is there?
Plas. Yes, will you part with it?
Cosey. No; I mean to keep a good look-out.
Mrs. T. Do you intend to reside there?
Cosey. Lord forbid.
Plas. Leave him to me.— [Mr. & Mrs. Trot, & Mrs. Glenroy retire together.] [250]   Pray, Sir, had not Sir Cardigan Somers a daughter?
Cosey. You know he had.
Plas. True; I believe she was once pointed out to me.
Cosey. Possibly.
Plas. I thought her beautiful, and spite of the family antipathy, wished to be introduc'd to her.
Cosey. Indeed!
Plas. But she suddenly disappeared without my ever having had that pleasure.—Do you know what has become of her?
Cosey. Do you?
Plas. No.— (Apart.) But I will, if I can. You are going to Wales?
Cosey. Yes.
Plas. So am I.
Cosey. Oh.
Plas. Suppose we post it together?
Cosey. No bargain—
Plas. Do you mean—
Cosey. Account's closed—words useless—
[Page 20]
balance not in your favour.
Plas. Indeed; but I'll be after you my old boy.
Mrs. G. [275]   Any news in town, Sir, yesterday.
Cosey. Yes, Ma'am: fifteen Levant arrivals, two foreign mails due,—things a shade better— gold in bars, heavy;—hops flat;—raw-hides lively; and cochineal as per last.
Mrs. G. Ha! ha! thank you, Sir; but I mean news from the squares.
Cosey. Know nothing about them—pity the cits who live at the west end—and yet I declare 'tis funny to see them duck through Temple-bar, like geese through a gate—and then wriggle, and stretch out their necks, when they come to the west side—this lady of fashion kisses her hand, as much as to say, I'll come and bring all my friends to live upon you—that lordling bows—set that down at twelve dozen of champaign —An earl cries, “Ah, Dick, my jolly Dog, your hand”—he means—to a note for five thousand.—So, there you may see the cits stuck up in the fine gala rooms, like calves in a penn: where they are bled till they are quite delicate and tender; then struck on the head with a docket, and consigned to that fruitful mortality bill, the London Gazette, where (not to drop the simile) like calves, they generally [300]   cut up for about tenpence in the pound.

[Page 21]
ACT II. SCENE I. —A Welch Village.— Enter Ross, Williams , and Taffline . Taff. Dear father.
Will. You promis'd me, if I was industrious, you would give me my sweet Taffline.— We should be the happiest couple in Wales.
Ross. You are too young, and too poor.
Taff. Poor! law father! has not Williams saved almost three guineas?
Ross. And what dower can you bring my Welch heiress?
Taff. Cheerful industry, and a constant heart.
Will. 'Tis hard to refuse us, when all the neighbours were to make holiday on purpose.
Taff. And your favourite, dear, good Miss Rosalie Somers had given us a wedding dinner.
Ross. Indeed! I should be loth to offend so sweet, so handsome, and so kind a young lady as Miss Somers is—but—
Taff. Oh! here she comes.
Enter Miss Rosalie , and Mrs. Moreen . Rosa. Well, my sweet Taffline, is all arranged for the wedding?

[Page 22]
Taff. No, Miss; father won't consent.
Rosa. Come, good Ross,—don't be churlish.
Ross. Indeed, Miss, the times are—
Mrs. M. [25]   Prettily changed with you. Ah! but for her father's misfortunes, she might have commanded, and you would have been glad to have obeyed; but now—
Ross. Mrs. Moreen, I won't bear that. I respect the daughter of Sir Cardigan Somers, as much as if she were still the heiress to this noble estate. And when it was sold, I doubt if Miss felt more than Robin Ross did.
Rosa. Well, well, you won't refuse Reuben Glenroy.
Ross. Refuse Reuben! not if he were to ask me for my heart's blood.—I owe him—
Rosa. Not much; for Reuben is not rich.
Ross. Every thing, Miss! I was always behind hand with the world—borrowed of one to pay another—never could hold up my head as an honest man ought, till he pointed out to me the road to independence: and now, though my pocket cannot boast many guineas of my own, thank heaven, it does not contain one that belongs to another. Ah, Reuben is a man.
Mrs. M. Not a very civil one—He's snappish, and glum—Give me a man that's merry— likes a good story, and says good things.
Rosa. [50]   While Reuben is content with doing them.
Ross. Here he comes down the mountain.
(Reuben appears descending the mountain, and looking at the heavens.) Reub. Ross, come hither. Have you observed the sky?—Look at that cloud.
Ross. Bless me, an evil messenger indeed!
[Page 23]
Very stormy—how does the mountain look?
Reub. The sun gilds its summit; but chilling vapours cling round its rugged sides.
Ross. It will be a foul night.
Reub. The air is dull and heavy.
Ross. A storm of snow then.
Reub. I thought so.—Williams, a storm threatens, and the passes over the mountains are full of danger to the benighted traveller. Pray keep careful watch to-night—I shall not sleep. Ross, I have obtained you a renewal of your lease from your landlord.
Ross. How can I thank you? What shall I say?
Reub. Nothing:—Let your conduct thank me; but we must wait on him instantly—so, come—Ah, Rosalie! (Runs to her.) In my excursion I met the messenger carrying letters to my father's—this I took charge of. (Gives a letter.)
Rosa. [75]   “Have brought a little present to Wales for you.—
Mrs. M. A present?—What can that be, I wonder.
Rosa. “Mean to stay with you the total of one entire day; so get ready a bason of broth, a kiss, and every thing what I call comfortable, for Christopher Cosey”— (To Reuben.) 'Tis from my guardian. Come, I suppose, to resign his charge, as to-morrow I am of age.
Ross. Of age! (They appear dejected.)
Mrs. M. Oh! what a day to-morrow would have been, if—
Reub. Come, come, it will be a happy
[Page 24]
one—and though the great world mayn't know of our festivity, yet, remember, the place which gives us birth, is the world of the heart—and what heart is there in it, that will not share our joy? Rosalie, return home, the heavens look tempestuous—Williams shall attend you; for I have business across the mountain.
Rosa. I know—the business of humanity.
(Exeunt Rosalie, Mrs. Moreen, Taffline and Williams. Reub. Sweet excellence!—Ross!
Ross. I wait for you, Sir.
Reub. [100]   I see her still—Ah—she falls—no, no; she waves her hand (He ascends part of the mountain.) Still I behold her.—O, lovely, lovely Rosalie!—Come, Ross, Come!
                                         (Exeunt. SCENE II. —A parlour in a Welch Parsonage House. Enter the Rev. Owen Glenroy , and Cosey . Owen. A thousand welcomes to Wales, Cousin Cosey.
Cosey. Thank you, Mr. Glenroy, thank you, my reverend friend. Well, how goes on your little parish—every thing what I call comfortable, eh?
Owen. Why, cousin I have many reasons for being proud of my small flock; and I humbly hope they have some for being content with their pastor.
Cosey. I don't doubt it.

[Page 25]
Owen. Well—and how does my son the captain go on?—A fine fashionable fellow, isn't he?
Cosey. Oh, very.
Owen. Married to a lord's daughter—think of that—he'll be a great man.
Cosey. (Coming forward.) Hopes above par, old boy, but I'll not lower the market on you.—But, where's Rosalie Somers?—is she not here to receive her guardian? Have not seen her since consols were 84—Ah! is not this she?
Enter Rosalie , and Mrs. Moreen . Rosa. My dear guardian!
Cosey. Let me see—let me taste— (Kisses her.) [25]   There's a skin, polished and smooth as a new bank note—here are roses—
Rosa. The effects of exercise; and, perhaps, the glow somewhat heightened by the pleasure of beholding the friend of my poor father.
Cosey. Thank you, thank you—kind as an accomodation bill, I declare. But, have you been at romps, eh? (Observing her hair disordered.)
Rosa. The effects of the brisk air of the mountain, which is delightful—
Cosey. Very—if you happen to be going the same way, else you may as well attempt London Bridge against tide, as face it. Ah, Mrs. Moreen, have you forgot your old sweetheart, Kit Cosey? She refused me; but don't look grave, for I assure you I have been remarkably happy ever since. (Looking at her.)
[Page 26]
What an escape I had. (Apart.) But now you talk of escapes, only think—the horses that were to have brought me here, not fancying your frightful, no, sublime hills, turned their heads towards Lunnun—sensible creatures!— could not help laughing—when all of a sudden, away they went, full gallop, and had almost got to [50]   the edge of a precipe, when a fine strapping fellow rushed down the mountain, seized the reins, and when I would not have given a lottery blank for my life, turned the account in my favour.
Owen. But who was he?
Cosey. That's what I want to know; for I shook so much (from cold I imagine) I could not immediately get my hand into my pocket to reward him; and when I did, egad he had skipped half up the mountain again.
Mrs. M. But have not you got a present for my young lady?
Cosey. Yes; and for you too; but all in good time. First, see my portmanteau safe to my room—and, Rosalie—lavender sheets—aired snow—snug supper—every thing what I call comfortable—eh?
Rosa. I'll take care.
                                         (Exeunt Rosalie, and Mrs. Moreen. Cosey. Bless you! and, to-morrow, we'll be as happy as 'tis possible to be—in the country. But what sort of a chap is this eldest son of yours—rough Reuben, as you used to call him.
Owen. He's difficult to describe.
Cosey. Is he clever?
Owen. [75]   Very.
Cosey. Not headstrong?

[Page 27]
Owen. Very.
Cosey. Diligent?
Owen. Very.
Cosey. Saucy.
Owen. Very.
Cosey. What does he delight in?
Owen. Rosalie.
Cosey. But zounds! that won't do.
Owen. Do you think I encourage him?
Cosey. I hope not. Consider, the daughter of Sir Cardigan Somers.
Owen. Of the first family, and once the richest heiress in the county.
Cosey. And may be again.
Owen. What?
Cosey. Nothing.
Reuben . (Without.) Reub. There, there, refresh yourselves—I'll soon be with you.
Enter Reuben . Owen. Here is my son.—Reuben, pay your respects to our worthy cousin, Rosalie's guardian.
Reub. Is she not beautiful?
Cosey. I'm pretty well, I thank—Eh!
Rosa. That will do, Mrs. Moreen.
                                         [Exit Reuben. Cosey. [100]   The very man that saved my life.
Owen. Indeed!
Cosey. He can't escape me now, however;—
[Page 28]
so give me your hand—why, confound the fellow, he's off again.
Owen. Why, Reuben, Reuben, I say.
                                         [Retires. Reuben. (Without.) Here, father, here.— Come, Rosalie.
Re-enter Reuben . Cosey. Zounds, Sir, you might have had the patience to let me thank you for saving my life.
Reub. Aye; but we hasty mountaineers, to prevent disappointment and delay, always take care to receive our reward, while doing an act of humanity.
Cosey. You're a noble, generous fellow.
Reub. Pshaw! how can you know?
Cosey. Because I know you are a brave fellow; and true courage, as I take it, is of too sociable a nature, ever to take lodging in that breast which has not plenty of other good company there.
Reub. Well, enough of this—'Twould please you, Sir, to see my father look so well.—He is respected and beloved; and did the legislature [125]   think fit to offer prize crosiers for the encouragement of ecclesiastical shepherds, I believe, the humble flock of my reverend father would be found neither tainted by the contagion of unbelief, nor contaminated by the rot of immorality. —You are from London, Sir—how goes on my brother?
Cosey. So so.
Reub. I fear him much.

[Page 29]
Cosey. (Coming forward.) So do I. But tell me, how came this brother to be the favourite child?
Reub. Oh, weighty reasons govern parents' prejudices.—My hair was rough and stubborn; my brother's ductile ringlets obeyed the mother's anxious hand;—mine resisted,—she tugged and I squalled:—Then a woman of rank in the neighbourhood, took it into her head to be my brother's godmother, and named, or rather nicknamed him Augustus; which, at once, made him the superior boy,— that is, poor fellow, he was compelled to hold up his head,—lose the luxury of exercise, for fear of taking cold; and be pinioned in a chair, and crammed with nauseous dainties to a surfeit, [150]   whenever his illustrious gossip condescended to take tea with my mother, at the parsonage.—Ah, poor mother!
Owen. Yet Reuben was of use to her; for when disease deprived her of motion, his agile limbs bore her to the mountain's brow, where the pure breath of nature cheered her drooping heart:—And when her life was despaired of, good, vain, woman,—she said that Augustus's mourning would be the smartest, but that Reuben's heart would ache as sorely as the best.
Cosey. (Coming forward.) Perhaps she was not wrong.
Enter Evans . (With a letter.) Evans. Sir,—a letter for you.
                                         [Exit Evans. (Owen Glenroy retires and reads the letter.) Reub. Thus, Sir,—a little neglected,
[Page 30]
perhaps,—though my heart suffered my head was the better for it; estranged from others, I grew the more acquainted with myself; and by books.—
Cosey. Books! What signifies books, if a man has not a nice cash-book among them.
Reub. Would you trust the cultivation of your estate to that man, who would not benefit by his neighbour's experience?
Cosey. Why, no.
Reub. [175]   Then, in the more important culture of the mind, what must he be, who will not gather from the store of human wisdom, those seeds, which produce in the heart and understanding, the inestimable harvest of knowledge and virtue?
Cosey. Humph! I'm not quite sure but I shall like this fellow. Why, one wou'dn't hear much better than that in the common council. Egad! if Rosalie likes him, be it so! But mum.
Enter Rosalie and Mrs. Moreen . (Reuben addresses Rosalie.) Reub. Rosalie! (Runs to her.)
Cosey. Ah! she's his omnium, I see.
Owen. Here's a letter from your brother.
Reub. A letter!—Why is he not here himself. (Takes the letter.)
Owen. He's with his wife's rich relations.
Reub. Instead of his own poor ones. (Reading.)
Owen. You envy your brother?

[Page 31]
Reub. I do indeed.
Owen. You never loved him.
Reub. Father, I've heard my manners, habits, studies, all derided with a smile; but now you insult my heart.
Owen. Did you not say you envied your brother?
Reub. I do:—I envy him the place that he [200]   holds here. (Putting his hand on his father's breast.)
Owen. Reuben, I've done you wrong. Why did not you go into the world? Why force your brother?
Reub. Nay, I cannot answer such questions.
Rosa. 'Tis your father asks.
Reub. Ah, Rosalie, why tear my secret from my breast? If I resigned my birthright to Augustus, perhaps it was that I preferred my brother's prosperity to my own—if I obstinately remained with my father— (Taking his hand, affectionately) perhaps it was, that to a father's absence I preferred a father's frowns.
Owen. Reuben, dear Reuben!
Reub. Pray no more. (Goes up the stage.)
Owen. How have I wronged him! He's like the iron from our mines—full of fire, hardy, and useful.
Rosa. And let me add, well tempered, and I am sure, capable of the highest polish.
Cosey. Well, my lad of metal, give me your hand. (Shaking hands.) Devilish deal of it in his fingers.
Enter Mrs. Moreen . Mrs. M. Supper's almost ready, and now for the present you brought.

[Page 32]
Cosey. [225]   Well, be it so. When your father, my dear Rosalie, by his election contests with the family of the Plastics—
Mrs. M. I hate the very name of them.
Cosey. Was compelled to leave England, he trusted his affairs to my management. I sold off all, and paid his debts to the world, while he, poor man, was paying the only one that remained —the debt due to nature. (Rosalie weeps.) Come, come; he neither left you pennyless, nor friendless.
Rosa. Ah, no; rich, rich in friends. (Reuben takes Rosalie's hand.)
Cosey. The money that remained, I took into the market, there I turned it, and twisted it—in short, good nursing did for it in the Alley, what good nursing has done for you in Wales; and by giving my little charge nice slices of loan, bits of bonus, and dividend dumplings, it throve, and like you, became plump and handsome. Well, last week, at Garaway's, the Cardigan estate was again sold.
Owen. And who bought it?
Mrs. M. Not one of the Plastic's, I hope?
Cosey. No.
Owen. Who did buy it then?
Cosey. [250]   Rosalie Somers. (Reuben drops Rosalie's hand, and remains abstracted.)
Owen, Mrs. M. What?
Cosey. I, as her agent, bought it for Rosalie Somers!
Owen. Blessed news!
Rosa. O, my dear guardian!

[Page 33]
Cosey. Yes, to-morrow the daughter of my early patron takes possession of her father's castle.
Mrs. M. And I of the housekeeper's room.
Owen. But I can't imagine how—
Cosey. I dare say you can't; but make no apologies.—You live in the country, and of course your knowing any thing isn't to be expected. Why, heyday, Reuben! don't you give Rosalie joy.—Dam'it, don't be shy. Come, come, let us to supper, and then I'll shew you the title deeds. And don't you call that a present?
Mrs. M. Then, with my large bunch of keys I once more sits me down in the red damask chair, he, he! I say, perhaps I shall die there, he, he!
Cosey. Aye, that will be what I call comfortable.
                                         [Exit Owen and Cosey. Mrs. M. And be buried in the family [275]   vault, he, he! Oh, if I do but live to see that day!
                                         [Exit Mrs. Moreen. Reub. Miss Somers!
Rosa. And why not Rosalie? Am I then, by acquiring a fortune, to lose a friend? (Taking his hand.)
Reub. Friend! Oh, too lovely woman— (Kneeling.)
Rosa. Nay, I entreat.
Reub. My swelling heart will not be controled —In mercy, hear me:—My words shall not offend—I ask but this,—do not banish me your presence— My happiness must ever be to see you happy;—then let me still watch your steps, guard you from every ill, and,
[Page 34]
though doomed to behold you another's, Oh! let me behold you!—
Rosa. Reuben, hear me:—Receive my promise.—Rosalie will never wound the heart that loves her? Oh, never.
Reub. Thanks—thanks!
Mrs. Moreen . (Without.) Mrs. M. Now then, to supper.
Reub. Remember.
                                         [Exeunt Rosalie and Reuben. SCENE III. —Supper on the table. Owen, Cosey. —Mrs. Moreen and Taffline discovered. Enter Rosalie and Reuben . Mrs. M. Heyday—here's a very blustering night coming on.
Cosey. This is what I call comfortable— Come, Rosalie.
Rosa. Reuben!
Reub. Pray, excuse me. (The rustling of the wind is heard.) Hush!—
Cosey. Lord, what a pretty whistling there is!
Reub. Now the storm comes on.
Cosey. Shall I help you, my dear? (The storm increases.)
Owen. Ah, an approaching hurricane. Reuben secure—

[Page 35]
Reub. Hush, father! All is secure.—Do not alarm our guest.
Cosey. (Coming forward.) So—so.—Some of the— sauce?— (The storm increases to violence.)
Rosa. 'Twill be a fearful night. (Reuben takes her hand in silence, and watches the tempest.)
Cosey. (Coming forward.) Eh—well—why don't you speak? Eh—Reuben—my dear friend— Rosalie—poor child!
Rosa. I assure you, Sir, I'm not much alarmed.
Cosey. [25]   Very likely; but I assure you I am. (Thunder.) —Pray is the firm of the house—I mean, is this house firm?
Owen. Doubt it not.
Cosey. Ah! but it stands all alone by itself; —if it was but in a row.—This is rural peace! This is content and a cottage! Oh, pretty, quiet London!
Mrs. M. I wonder whether the windows are shut.
                                         [Exit Mrs. Moreen. Williams . (At a distance without.) Will. Reuben!
Reub. Hark!
Cosey. What's the matter?
Will. Reuben!
Reub. Ah! I'm called. (Opens the door.)
Enter Williams . Will. I heard the cry of some one in distress;
[Page 36]
but the storm rages with such violence—
Reub. Never fear—let us prepare.
                                         [Exeunt Williams and Reuben. Rosa. Some distressed travellers.
Cosey. Well, I'm very sorry; but you know it can't be helped, don't you think we had better go to bed?
Owen. Look here, Cousin—how sublimely awful!
Cosey. (Coming forward.) Very.
Owen. [50]   Let us look out. 'Tis what you may not see again.
                                         [Exit. Cosey. No, I'll take care of that, you may depend on't.
                                         [Exit. Enter Reuben , with a pole, pointed at the end with iron. Reub. Adieu, Rosalie! Now Providence direct my steps!
Rosa. Heaven shield thee, noble, dear Reuben. (Is confused.)
Reub. Pray be careful —your words to me are life or death.— “Dear Reuben!”—Let it not unman me!
Williams . (Without.) Will. We are ready.
Reub. No— (Snatching up the pole.) Let it rouse my soul to virtuous enterprize!—My glorious aim shall be to merit it.
                                         [Exit. Rosa. Heaven guide and protect him!

[Page 37]
Enter Owen . Owen. Be cautious, Reuben.—Come bustle —bustle—keep up the fire within, and prepare warm beds.
Mrs. Moreen . (Without.) Mrs. M. I'll take care, I warrant you.
Owen. The rage of the storm seems to abate. Come Taffline—let us beguile the anxious hour with the simple melody of some native song.
SONG.

Llewelyn with his Patience dear
   Was join'd in wedlock's band,
[75]   When wars alarm his ear,
   The foe invades the land.
He march'd among the valiant throng,
   All proud of heart was he,
And, smiling, cried, my lovely bride,
   I'll soon return to thee.
      Oh, Kora, Oh, Kora, I'll soon return to thee.

She hears the drum, the victor's cry
   Your laurels now prepare,
She views their march with eager eye,
   Her lover is not there!
His knapsack blue,—shot thro' and thro',
   They laid down on her knee,
And, sighing, cried, Ah, luckless bride,
   He'll ne'er return to thee.
                                         Oh, Kora, &c.

She lost her love, she lost her wits,
   She hasten'd far away,
And now on Snowden's cliffs she sits,
   And wildly sings her lay.
[Page 38]

My eyes I strain across the plain,
   My hope, my love to see;
My joy, my pride, behold thy bride,
   Ah, sweet return to me.
                                         Ah, Kora, sweet return to me. Rosa. [100]   Heigh-ho! Reuben not yet come home.—Surely I heard.—Again— (Runs to the door.) He returns.
Enter Reuben and Williams , bearing Plastic in their arms, who is insensible—his forehead bearing the marks of a wound.— Evans leads Hawbuck across. Mrs. Moreen enters opposite. Owen. Well done, my son! (They put Plastic into a chair.)
Reub. Quick, quick, to the fire with him!— Rosalie!
Mrs. M. He's senseless. There, there.
Reub. 'Tis but a swoon, I hope.—Take care of him.
Owen. Bear him in—all will soon be well, I warrant. [Plastic is carried off between Williams and Mrs. Moreen, followed by Owen.
Rosa. Are you not fatigued, Reuben?
Reub. Not much.
Rosa. Is he a stranger whom you have succoured?
Reub. I don't know—his features were disfigured with blood, and his eyes closed.—
Enter Mrs. Moreen . Rosa. How is the gentleman?

[Page 39]
Mrs. M. There is no great danger, I hope.—His wound bleeds freely, and he recovers apace.—He seems a nice young man.
                                         [Exit with medicines. Rosa. Surely you want rest and refreshment. —Come, sit down.
Reub. Sweet Rosalie, I must forth again.— More travellers are out.
Rosa. [125]   Not to-night!
Reub. Oh think—perhaps some anxious wife, surrounded by her little brood,—with haggard eye and throbbing heart,—watches the oft turn'd hour-glass, and, amid the howlings of the storm, vainly fancies she hears her husband's voice.—I may restore him to her.—Oh! could these lids close with that thought knocking at my breast.—Once more, adieu! And my work being fairly done, my sleep will be the sweeter for it. (He takes her hand and kisses it respectfully.) “Rosalie will never wound the heart that loves her.”—Remember thy promise to me.
                                         [Exit. Plastic (Without.) Plas. Where is my deliverer? Conduct me to him.
Mrs. Moreen (Without.) Mrs. M. Nay, nay, by and by.
Plas. I am much better— pray, oblige me.

[Page 40]
He enters, leaning on Mrs. Moreen .—A black patch on his forehead—his right arm in a sling. Mrs. M. Why, if you will see Reuben, you must. Is he gone?
Rosa. He is.
Plas. What angel's that?
Mrs. M. My young lady, Miss Rosalie Somers. (Plastic starts.) What's the matter, [150]   Sir?
Plas. Nothing—I can walk alone. 'Tis she! How beautiful!
Mrs. M. Is not she? How pleased Reuben would be to hear you say so—for he loves her so.
Plas. I do not wonder.
Rosa. I hope, Sir, you have not sustained much injury.
Plas. Stunn'd by the overturning of my carriage, and rendered lifeless by the piercing cold, I should have perished, but for the exertion of my brave preserver, My head and arm are bruised, nothing more. (Apart.) Have I found you?
Mrs. M. You seem a stranger—May we ask your name?
Plas. S'death! If I'm known, my hopes are ruin'd,—Maitland, Madam.
Mrs. M. Not Captain Maitland, related to Sir Cardigan Somers.
Plas. The same; and happy in being thus indebted to the humane attentions of my kind Cousin.
Mrs. M. He's a sweet man. Pray, Sir, do
[Page 41]
[175]   you happen to know any thing of the Plastics?
Plas. I keep no such company.
Mrs. M. The young one, I hear, is an oily-tongu'd chap; but he would find his match here—We'll surprise him, and his vulgar family to-morrow.
Plas. He'll do his best to return the compliment.
Rosa. Come, Sir, you must submit to your nurses. You are still feeble and need repose.—Let me support you.
Plas. Thanks, my fair cousin.
                                         [Exeunt.

END OF THE SECOND ACT.

[Page 42]
ACT III. SCENE I. —The Dining Room. Enter Plastic , with caution. Plas. Day breaks and that Yorkshire booby not yet return'd. If I effect my purpose, what a delicious triumph! Rosalie Somers my mistress! love! revenge! all gratified! (Looks at his watch.) Where can?—Oh, he is here at last. Softly!
Enter Hawbuck . Haw. There be a chaise ready in road.— How tired I be!
Plas. Wait there till I come.
Haw. Lord, what it is to be a sarvant!
Plas. You have not mentioned my name.
Haw. Oh no, I had my reasons.
Plas. Your reasons!
Haw. Why, one was that, I've forgot what it is.
Plas. Convenient stupidity—Forget your master's name!
Haw. Why, Sir, they crammed my head so full at school, that hang me if I think it will hold ony more.
Plas. Maitland, blockhead.

[Page 43]
Haw. Oh! aye! so it is—I know fast enough.
Plas. Ah! a door opens.—Go, and be ready. [25]   By all my hopes tis she!
Enter Rosalie in a walking dress. Rosa. Reuben not return'd! I'll walk, and perhaps I may find him. (Seeing Plastic.) — Good morning, Sir, have you not ventured out too early?
Plas. Affairs of the first consequence call me away. My chaise waits in the road, and could I but see my preserver!
Rosa. Reuben is not yet come home; but, probably you may meet him.
Plas. I hope not. Is the place far off, where he last night rescued me from death?
Rosa. Oh, no, Sir.
Plas. Now, stript of its horrors, I wish I could behold it.
Rosa. I was about to walk that way. I'll point it out to you, Sir, with pleasure.
Plas. May not the morning air affect your health?
Rosa. Oh, no; I always walk thus early
Plas. Let me controul my joy! Yet, one achievement more.—'Tis hard thus abruptly to quit this hospitable roof; but my happiness demands it. Yet, at least, let me [50]   leave a written testimony of my gratitude.
Rosa. Here is a pen and ink, Sir. (Presenting writing materials.) (Plastic attempts to write, but expresses painful sensations.)
[Page 44]
I fear you suffer pain, Sir, from your wounded arm.
Plas. Agony! But it would be greater torture to depart, without expressing the feelings of a grateful heart.
Rosa. Shall I take the pen?
Plas. Will you be so kind? I can sign it.
Rosa. True, Sir:—Pray, dictate. (Writes.)
Plas. What apology can I offer for thus abruptly leaving those, who have so kindly sheltered, and protected me? But love beckons, and pleasure awaits me;—therefore, I hope the hearts of those I leave behind, will pardon mine, for thus following its ardent dictates.
Rosa. Now, Sir, your signature.
Plas. Not for a thousand—
Rosa. Sir!
Plas. A thousand thanks. (Folds the letter without signing it.)
Enter Mrs. Moreen , dressed in brocade. Mrs. M. Bless me! what, are you going to walk out? I fear I've mistaken the hour.
Plas. This, Madam, may in future prevent that inconvenience.
Mrs. M. Oh, Sir!—
Plas. [75]   Put it up—Come, fair cousin;—but this letter.—
Rosa. Give this to Reuben —Adieu!
Mrs. M. They're a sweet couple —Pity they should part, I think.

[Page 45]
Plas. I think so too—She's mine.
                                         (Exeunt Plastic and Rosalie. Mrs. M. That's a true gentleman, as sure as this is true gold. With my keys on this side, and my watch on this— (A harp plays without.) Oh, here come the neighbours—Eh! such a day as this will be!
Enter Owen , and Taffline . Owen. Welcome, my pretty lasses.
Mrs. M. They are rather late though—at least by my watch.
Taff. What a beautiful gown you have on, Ma'am?
Mrs. M. Do you think so, my dear? I mean now to wear such tasty, fashionable clothes as these every day.
Owen. Where's Rosalie!
Mrs. M. She walked out with Mr. Maitland, about—let me see, by my watch, four minutes and a half ago.
Owen. Is not my son Reuben return'd.
Mrs. M. [100]   No, Sir; but I dare say he'll be here soon; for I perceive 'tis near eight o'clock. Now, go and prepare them to give Miss Rosalie joy—you don't know how happy you are all to be. I'll come to you in—let me see —aye, in five minutes.
                                         (Exit Taffline. Owen. Very splendid, indeed!
Mrs. M. A present from Mr. Maitland.
Enter Williams . (Running.) Will. Oh, dear, Sir!

[Page 46]
Owen. You look alarm'd—Speak—Reuben?
Will. Is safe—but Miss Rosalie.
Owen. What?
Will. Is gone!
Owen. Gone!
Will. A post chaise and four flew along the road; and in it were Miss Rosalie, and the gentleman we brought home last night.
Owen. Cousin Cosey—Cousin Cosey—awake! (Knocks at his door.)
Will. I'll swear it was Miss Somers.
                                         (Exit Williams. Mrs. M. What eloped!
Owen. Cousin! Cousin! Mr. Cosey, awake!
Cosey . (Without.) Cosey. What's the matter?
Owen. What's to be done? Cousin!— [125]   Cousin!
Enter Cosey , half asleep—Night-cap on. Cosey. What, 'tis all over with us—Well, heaven's will be done. Mercy on us! how it lightens!
Owen. No, no—awake!
Cosey. Oh dear! 'tis day-light. What's the matter now! More rural peace? more calm content?
Owen. Rosalie is gone.
Cosey. Gone!
Mrs. M. Has eloped.
Cosey. Eloped! (Greatly agitated.) Run
[Page 47]
to Bow-street—Call at the City Marshall's— I'll to the Mansion House.
Owen. Mansion House!
Cosey. Oh, I forgot where I was. Who's the lover?
Mrs. M. Her cousin, Captain Maitland.
Cosey. Maitland! Nonsense! to my knowledge he has been dead these twelve months— No, 'tis some innocent swain, some virtuous villager. Oh! you're a damn'd wicked set.
Enter Evans , with a small trunk. Evans. Sir, I have just picked up this box, where we found the gentleman last night.
Cosey. Get me a coach, Sir:—I won't stay [150]   among you another hour.
Owen. Perhaps this may discover—here's a name. (Clasps his hands, and exclaims) Charles Plastic!
Mrs. M. Who!
Cosey. It is—Oh, the jade!
                                         [Exit Evans, with the trunk. Mrs. M. Plastic! give me that watch.
Owen. Stay, let me see. (Looking at the seals.) 'Tis true, here are his family arms.
Mrs. M. Give it to me. (Throws it down, and treads on it.) There, there—I suppose, Miss will want me to be her housekeeper— I hope she will! for if I don't poison them all—Oh, I shall faint!
Cosey. Pray, don't, I dare say you ought; but consider, we have not time just now— Where's my coach?
Mrs. M. It will kill me.
Cosey. Now, don't die yet—I'll take it as a personal favour.

[Page 48]
Owen. Oh, my friend! who dares tell this news to Reuben?
Cosey. Not I, I'm sure.
Owen. Poor fellow! 'twill break his heart.
Cosey. No don't say so.—He'll bear it like [175]   a man, as I do. (Sobbing.) Graceless, unfeeling girl!
Reuben . (Without.) Reub. Joy, joy to all!
Cosey. Here he comes, now don't tell him. Talk about any thing else. Hush!
Enter Reuben . Reub. — Heigh-ho!
Owen. Fatigued, my son?
Reub. Aye, father, my limbs complain; but all here is warm and well. (Striking his breast.)
Cosey. What a fine thing courage must be, to keep out so much cold!
Reub. Sir, courage in the breast is, like the cash in your pocket, only placed there for the benefit of the unfortunate, who may want it.—
Owen. Pray, take some rest, Reuben.
Cosey. Aye, go to bed.
Mrs. M. Be persuaded, now do.—
Reub. What, sleep to-day! Be dead to those sounds of joy, which bear the name of Rosalie? Oh, no!—
Owen. Then, take some refreshment.
Reub. My mind shall banquet first—So, tell
[Page 49]
me, where is my Rosa—Why do you turn [200]   from me? Have I offended any one? Has my conduct merited?—
Owen. You have deserved blessings.
Reub. Which I shall receive. Even now, seated on a rock, I beheld the rising sun— its earliest beam shone upon me, and seemed to warm my heart—seemed sent as a reward, that, in its absence I had done my duty. But how is the gentleman I so fortunately succoured?
Owen. Perfectly recovered.
Reub. And is not that a reward?
Owen. And he is gone.
Reub. I'm sorry for it. The pilot that guides the shatter'd bark into the wish'd-for haven, thinks his joy imperfect, unless he behold it floating on the wave, tranquil and secure. Well, well—let him go.—There is a smile prepared for me, that will atone for all. Where is she?
Owen. She! who?
Reub. Who, who? Rosalie—Again silent! Father, what means?—Rosalie—Rosa—
                                         (Rushes off. Owen. Poor fellow!
Cosey. Noble fellow! Is this his reward? Stabbed to the heart, by the man he saved! [225]   Forsaken by the woman he lived for!— (Bursts into tears.) I don't know what to do—all this is entirely out of my line—this never happens upon Change.
Owen. I dread his return. What can I say, to sooth—

[Page 50]
Re-enter Reuben . Reub. In mercy—at once—Rosalie—speak—
Owen. She has left us, Reuben.
Cosey. Eloped with him you last night preserved.
Mrs. M. With young Plastic.
(Reuben staggers into a chair.) Cosey. Come, come, she don't deserve a sigh—She's gone, and there's an end.—'Tis all over, and we'll be, what I call, comfortable without her, and—eh!
(Reuben, feeling his brain affected, his frame convulsed, looks with anxiety at his father, then catching Cosey's hand, whispers.) Reub. Persuade my father to leave the room.
Owen. No, no; thy father will not leave thee—thou hast fasted long—pray take some refreshment.
Reub. I cannot—my heart is here—choked —choked.
Cosey. But, perhaps she was beguiled away. Stratagem might have been used.
Mrs. M. Lord, what a head have I! Here's a letter she desired me to give Reuben. (Reuben takes it.)
Cosey. Oh! this may explain—put—put all [250]   things to rights, you know—See, 'tis her hand.
Reub. Gone! She said—
Cosey. Read—read.
(Reuben attempts it, but gives the letter to Cosey.) Cosey. Let us see. (Reads.) “What apology can I offer, for thus abruptly leaving
[Page 51]
those who have so kindly sheltered and protected me? But love beckons, and pleasure awaits me; therefore, I hope the hearts of those I leave behind, will pardon mine, for thus following its ardent dictates.”
Owen. Lost—abandon'd girl!
Cosey. Cruel!
Reub. No, 'twas kindly meant to break my heart at once. (Folding it to his breast.) There, be satisfied.
Owen. How wild his eyes are! I fear his senses are unsettled.
Reub. Let me go, father—I shall be better alone. “Rosalie will never wound the heart that loves her!” An angel spoke those words, and they are false. Oh! tear them from my memory —they burn—they madden!—Father, why gird my poor brain with hoops of iron? In mercy loose them. Ah! now I'm free— Rosalie, I come. (Rushes out.)
Owen. [275]   Here, Williams! Enter Williams . Reuben has rushed out, distracted.—Ask not the cause—follow—save him.
                                         (Exit Williams. Mrs. M. Now, all I have to do, is to go into a poor-house and die.
Cosey. What! Oh, you shameful, lazy, old woman! Go into a poor-house when you can honestly earn fifty pounds a year, as my housekeeper! Come, cheer up! But, where's the coach?

[Page 52]
Enter Evans . Evans. The post-horses are knock'd up— Coachman won't come.
Cosey. He won't! Dam'me, I'll trounce him! Do you go, and just take his number —That's all!
Evans. His number?
Cosey. Oh! I forgot where I was.
Evans. Here's a letter, Sir, from London.
                                         (Exit. Cosey. (Coming forward.) From my clerk—come to tell me, I suppose that stocks are ten per cent against me, and that waddle is the word—very well!—never was in a better humour for it— (Reads.) “Sir, I'm sorry to inform you”— (blessed journey I've made of it!) “that Captain Glenroy was yesterday arrested”— (Folds the letter.)
Owen. [300]   What, my son—my dear Augustus— nay, it shall not be concealed—let me know the worst—I can bear it, indeed I can.
Cosey. (Coming forward.) “I have, according to your order, settled with his creditor”—
Owen. Good, kind friend!
Cosey. (Coming forward.) “But I find he is completely ruined”—
Owen. Wretched father! my heart will break.
Cosey. Dam'me, if it shall though, for a few odd thousands. I tell you what, I'll take Reuben to London with me—it may amuse him— poor fellow!—and I'm sure he'll go, when he knows he can serve his brother—He'll play the very devil in my little counting-house;
[Page 53]
but, never mind; he'll reform Augustus.— Come, come, let's find him.
Owen. Would I were in my grave!
Cosey. No, no; that would not be what I call comfortable.
                                         (Exeunt. SCENE II. —A desolate mountain. Reuben discovered sitting on a rock, in a state of apathy. — Williams and Ross , enter, on seeing him. Will. He's found!
Enter Owen , and Cosey . Owen. Ah my son! raise him from the ground. (They bring him forward.) Do you not know me, Reuben?
Reub. Yes.
Owen. Here are all your friends and neighbours —all that love you.
Reub. All that love me! (Looks about.) True, here are all.
Ross. See your poor father—pity his affliction!
Reub. My father! where? Oh! do not weep. See I don't weep.
Cosey. (Coming forward.) Be sure you keep clear of Rosalie—speak of his brother.
Owen. Have I then no cause for weeping. —Thy brother is ruin'd—ruined by dissipation —You love him?
Reub. Love! whom?
Owen. Your dear brother—He is lost to virtue.

[Page 54]
Reub. Who's lost to virtue? (With quickness.)
Owen. My son, Augustus.
Reub. Who? Augustus, did you say? What! Tell me of him.
Owen. [25]   Reuben, you may yet save him.
Reub. What! save my brother? Oh repeat— press it on my benumbed heart—that I can save—
Cosey. Yes, yes; you can—let us, my friend, leave this place.
Reub. Aye, aye, instantly—for there she once reclined.— (Covering his face.)
Owen. Take leave of your friends. (They approach him.)
Ross. You still will remember us.
Will. Still love us, Reuben.
Reub. I have now more cause than ever; for you have made this heart to beat again—but strong reasons prevent my ever returning with you to those scenes, where we were all so happy.—Heaven bless you—now to Augustus—loose not a moment.
Cosey. Aye, go, go.
Owen. His poor father would die to save him.
Reub. His brother will do more—he'll live to save him.
                                         (Exeunt Reuben and Owen. Cosey. Farewell to you!
Ross. Ah, the poor will have cause to mourn his loss.
Cosey. [50]   Oh, true; here—be Reuben's agent. Take this purse, there.—Good bye to you all (Exeunt peasants.) and now (taking off his hat and bowing) farewell, Ma'am Nature—as I don't mean to trouble you again, grateful for
[Page 55]
all favours—you have broke my coach, broke my shins, broke my rest, and almost broke my heart—however I have learnt to post your account under the proper heads—For zephyrs, read hurricanes; for dew-drops, hail-stones as big as bullets; for calm content, thunder and discord —and for village paradise, the devil's own workshop.

END OF THE THIRD ACT.

[Page 56]
ACT IV. SCENE I. —A fashionable Egyptian Room in London. Enter Stilt , with various Tradesmen . Stilt. Porter, attend the door, for your master, Mr. Trot, is expected from the country every moment; and mind, shew him in here, the new Egyptian room. (Tradesmen advance, offering money.) Really, this is extremely irregular. It is true that, as Major Domo to Mr. Trot, certain douceurs appertain to my office from you, gentlemen Tradesmen. But, presenting money in this way, is indelicate, and improper, because, by accepting one offer, I may preclude a more liberal negociator.—Therefore, attend—Our expenditure will be enormous, but our resources are infinite. To-morrow bring your proposals sealed up. The biddings may be a per centage on profits; but remember, that I shall require security for the performance of your contracts, and that no tender can be received after one o'clock. (A knock at the door.) Retire and wait. (Exeunt Tradesmen.) Attend the door.

[Page 57]
                                         Enter Thomas , preceding Mr. Trot , who, looking about, stumbles against Stilt . (Exit Thomas.) Trot. So, one fashionable Buck is here already.—Oh, I know Mrs. Glenroy expected her husband.—Captain Glenroy, I presume?
Stilt. [25]   No, Sir; I have the honour to be Major Domo—
Trot. Sir, I humbly ask pardon.
Enter Mrs. Trot. My dear, give me leave.—Mrs. Trot,—Major Domo.—Major Domo,—Mrs. Trot.
Mrs. T. I shall sink with shame.—Major, indeed!
Trot. Then, what gentleman is?—
Mrs. T. Your gentleman—Your servant.
Trot. Oh! (Walks round him, and compares clothes.)
Stilt. Yes, Sir, my talents are yours; the consideration eighty pounds a year, and your wardrobe.
Trot. Oh, eighty pounds, and you take my clothes. Suppose I make it a hundred, and let me take yours.
Mrs. T. Mr. Trot, I blush for you. 'Tis time indeed, your drapery was changed. Let the proper people attend.
Stilt. Yes, Ma'am.
                                         (Exit Stilt.
[Page 58]
Enter Mrs. Glenroy. Mrs. G. What, quarreling so soon with the purveyors of taste.—I assure you fashion is very accommodating. But where is Augustus all this while? (Knocking at the door.)
Mrs. T. Perhaps, 'tis he—I vow, I long to [50]   see him.
Enter Captain Glenroy . Mrs. G. My dear husband!
Capt. G. My sweet Honoria!
Mrs. G. Ah! You don't look well, Augustus.
Capt. G. Fatigued by military duty, nothing more—But, tell me, what says your father? Is he reconciled to our marriage. Has your journey been a happy one?
Mrs. G. Oh, no; he refused even to see me. But come—don't look so triste —How is our sweet infant—well?
Capt. G. Quite well.
Mrs. G. Have you longed for my return? I shall hear what a rake you've been. But I ask a thousand pardons. I prattle out of tune. Captain Glenroy. (Presenting him.)
Mrs. T. Charming fellow!
Trot. Pretty soul!
Capt. G. Your protection of Mrs. Glenroy, Madam, claims my acknowledgements.
Mrs. T. Sir, I hope you will consider this house, and its pleasures at your command.

[Page 59]
Capt. G. Infinitely obliged by your politeness.
Trot. Never mind [75]   fathers—You'll find those, who will be happy to serve you.
Mrs. G. Highly flattered by your friendship. (Trot and Mrs. Trot advance on Mr. and Mrs. Glenroy who, bowing, retreat unperceived.)
Trot. Beautiful woman —Oh lud!
Mrs. Trot. [To Trot.] Elegant youth— A hem! You are not going?
(Captain and Mrs. Glenroy advance.) Capt. G. We must intrude here no longer.
Mrs. T. Positively I forbid it, till you have taken refreshments. Happy pair! And yet, my young friends, you'll find wretches, who will want to part you.
Mrs. G. Do you think so?
Trot. Oh yes.
Mrs. G. I vow, you quite alarm me—Then, how prudent will it be in us, to cement a friendship here, where we behold the sweet union of two hearts, which, at once, excites our envy and imitation.
Mrs. T. Very true:—We are indeed blest. (To Trot, angrily, and apart.) Why [100]   don't you look tender?
Mrs. G. There's an interesting picture! Come, my Augustus!

[Page 60]
Capt. G. My sweet Honoria. (They join hands.)
                                         Exeunt. Mrs. T. (Imitating.) Come, my Peter!
Trot. Oh, my Peggy!
                                         (Exeunt. SCENE II. —London— Plastic's house—staircase in the centre of the stage. Plastic descends, with a key in his hand. Plas. Very well, my proud heroine! if you will be insensible to the pleasures I intend you, I must refer you to time, and a patent lock,—both warranted sure in their operations. Unreasonable Rosalie Somers! Sweet name! 'twou'd be a thousand pities to change it! Not but a sham marriage would be a convenient sedative enough for the qualms of conscience.— But, dam'it they are only to be found in novels and plays.
Ente Hawbuck . (Running.) Haw. Lord, Sir, I'm glad I've found you.
Plas. Where have you been?
Haw. That's what I want to know. They sent me out to look for you, and they told me to call at the Cocoa Tree.—The Thatched House.—But damn the tree or thatched house could I see in the whole place.—
Plas. Ha, ha, ha!
Haw. But I say, Sir, had you seen, as I was jaistering along, how waggishly the lasses looked at me!—Made I quite shameful.—Ah!
[Page 61]
thinks I, I wish I knew where to buy some of that pratty bold stuff that you put on your faces. So looking about, I saw written again [25]   a house side, “The London Assurance.”— Dam'it, says I, this is the shop, and in I jumped; but I ware wrong again—however, they told me not to be frightful, for they would insure me my life, which was very civil; for just before, I had a'most been run over wid coaches. (A knocking at the door.)
Plas. See who's at the door. (Hawbuck going.) That's not the way.
Haw. You know I can see who it is at window.
Plas. Answer the door.
Haw. Answer a door! he, he, he!
Plas. S'death! open it.
Haw. Oh!— (Exit.—Returns.) Sur, it be Captain Glenroy.
Plas. Show him in—and do you hear? when he is gone, carry some refreshment up stairs—You understand—be careful. (Giving him the key.)
Haw. Oh, snug.
                                         [Exit. Re-enter Hawbuck , showing in Captain Glenroy . —Exit Hawbuck . Plas. Glenroy—I'm very glad to see you.
Capt. G. Thank you, Charles. (Throws himself into a chair.)
Plas. You seem disturbed. (With keen inquiry.) Any ill news from Wales?
Capt. G. No, no. (Apart.) Thank Heaven, they are unacquainted with my conduct.—Did my
[Page 62]
[50]   poor father know my folly, my misery.— (Strikes his forehead.)
Plas. Well, how has fortune behaved to you?
Capt. G. As she does to all who trust her— beggar'd me.
Plas. Some she enriches.
Capt. G. None—those who win, put their trust in a deity, that takes more care of its votaries. —The child of fortune plays fair, and is ruined, the pupil of fraud, cheats and thrives.
Plas. Then, why pursue a losing game?
Capt. G. Why does the glutton banquet with the gout?—Why does the lover court the mistress who wrongs him?—Simply, because he's mad.—However I am cured.
Plas. Those who have not left themselves a guinea to stake, generally are.
Capt. G. Gaming, Charles, must end in ruin.
Plas. And life must end in death, yet we're devilish jolly!—And remember, that a lucky moment at play, like the crisis of a fever, may produce convalescence in our purses, and make us good for another campaign. (Apart.) I wish he were gone.—So, spite of your lecture, [75]   I shall be off to the club.
Capt. G. Happy fellow!—I mean, I pity you.
Plas. Ha, ha! thank you.
Capt. G. I have done, I tell you; and my commission—
Plas. Will amply support the establishment of the most fashionable wife in town, ha, ha!
Capt. G. Damnation! But for my beloved
[Page 63]
Honoria, I could smile at poverty. By all that's sacred, 'tis for her sake alone that—
Plas. You will condescend to accept the loan of a few hundreds, and once more try.— (Presenting notes.)
Capt. G. Charles—generous fellow!—If you really think I ought to try once more, why—
Plas. Upon my soul, I do.
Capt. G. But, only once more.
Plas. Oh! certainly—only once more. Well, Glenroy, I'll follow you—throw boldly, my boy—but don't clear all out—leave me the sweepings.
Capt. G. Farewell.—Hope and despair both urge me on.
                                         [Exit. Enter Hawbuck . (Carrying refreshments.) Plas. Very well—Not a word. (Hawbuck ascends the stairs.) So, Glenroy is in my [100]   power; and if the necessities of his wife should require the same sum, why she'll be in my power. (A crash of broken china and glass is heard.) Clumsy scoundrel! (Hawbuck runs down the stairs.)
Haw. Lord have mercy, Sir!
Plas. What's the matter?
Haw. Matter! Why, Miss, up stairs be gone.
Plas. Gone! Impossible!
Haw. Quite impossible. (Plastic runs up.) Only she happens not to be there, that's all.

[Page 64]
Plas. The window forced! When—how? (Descends.) Run!
Haw. Yes, Sir.
Plas. Where are you running?
Haw. I don't know.
Plas. 'Tis all owing to your damn'd stupidity. —You should have watched,—and—Distraction! my hopes destroy'd, my conduct exposed. — (Walks about, agitated.)
Haw. Ha, ha! Ecod, she mun be a nice clever lass, however, like!
Plas. 'Tis amusing! isn't it?
Haw. Yes, varry, I think, he, he!
Plas. You do—here are five pounds for [125]   you.
Haw. Thank you, Sir:—Nice snug place this I've got.
Plas. Now, go—I discharge you! Go! (Violently.)
Haw. Go—where? (Alarmed.)
Plas. To the devil.—Go. (Points to the door.)
Haw. I'll follow you, Sir, if you please.
Plas. If you remain in this house five minutes, I'll break every bone in your infernal ugly body.—Out-trick'd! exposed!—
                                         [Exit. Haw. My ugly body! that's malice. Ecod, he's gone—however, I've got five pounds, and this grand coat.—Come, that's fair enough for three day's sarvice.—Ecod, I'm not quite sure that I will go home. For if your cocknies be such flats as that, there can be no call for a lad brought up in Yorkshire, to be in a hurry to go away.
                                         [Exit.
[Page 65]
SCENE II. —A fashionable Street. Enter Cosey and Reuben . Cosey. (Coming forward.) “Oh, rare London Town! charming London Town!” Thank heaven, here we are!—Aye, here are nice hard flags to walk on—there are your houses, so pretty-all-of-a-row, like my ledgers —Does it not raise your spirits, eh? Only see me in the city by and by—up to Lloyd's—down to the Jerusalem—cross to the Bank—into the Alley—pop to Garraway's —But, hey day, Reuben! what are you looking for, eh?
Reub. Is not my brother's residence in this neighbourhood?
Cosey. Oh! true—Egad! I had quite forgot —There the prodigal lives; but he is not worth our care.
Reub. Oh, Sir! the hope of restoring a brother to virtue, is the only balmy drop that is mingled in my cup of bitterness—do not dash it from my lips.
Cosey. He is an incorrigible gamester.
Reub. I hope not. But, should his misfortunes urge him to despair—think of my poor father—Who then will cheer his latter [25]   day?
Cosey. Has he not Reuben?
Reub. He may not live long.
Cosey. Come, come, no more of that There's my pocket-book—the contents are yours. But don't let brotherly love get the better of honest discretion

[Page 66]
Reub. Worthy friend, doubt me not.
Cosey. Good bye! but damn the dumps. I'll soon put you in spirits—I say, I'll shew you our Hall and Bedlam, and Newgate; and we'll be so jolly!—And should I hear any thing of Rosalie—My dear fellow, I ask a thousand pardons for bringing her to your mind.
Reub. Bringing her to my mind! Ah, Sir!
                                         (Exit. Cosey. An ungrateful jade! Where can she be? Pugh! no matter.—I would not go the length of this cane to save her from— (Looking out.) Eh! why sure, is that— (Running and calling). Rosalie,—won't you speak to your old guardian? Oh lud! no—nothing like her—No, not the length of this cane. Enter Trot . Ah, my old friend, welcome to London.
Trot. Thank you.
Cosey. [50]   Isn't it a jolly place?
Trot. Oh, very—
Cosey. But, heyday! You don't seem to be, what I call, comfortable.
Trot. No, not particularly so.
Cosey. That's because you don't live in the city.—Here, even their language is unintelligible.
Trot. Oh! but I've learnt some of that. When any body says, “How are you?” I am to say I am in great force, and that my wife's in high preservation; then I'm to throw in taste and style into every sentence, just like mean and cloves in a cookery book.

[Page 67]
Cosey. Then, their late hours—
Trot. Why, that's pretty well managed; for when we have a party, I am to sup before dinner, and then I can attend to the guests.—But, zounds! they won't attend to me—they make such a fuss about the new woman, as they call my wife, that nobody thinks of the old man. Last night, when the rooms were as full as a bag of cotton, they elbowed me about, 'till I was forced to tell them who was man of the house; and then a squallid, nankeen-faced fop lounged [75]   up to me, munching a bunch of grapes, that cost me a guinea, and sputtering the skins in my face, said, I was a damn'd fine fellow, and had better go to bed.
Cosey. Oh, 'tis like them.
Trot. But that was nothing to what I went thro' at the club.
Cosey. What, have you been at a stylish club too?
Trot. Oh, yes; and one member said, if I would make it worth his while, he would caricature me—another asked me if I was ever out?—I said, every morning, then they all laughed at me. In short, they set me on fire, with ice cream made of cayenne, and quenched me with claret; and when I was completely what they called, turned up, they ordered a porter, pinned my direction on my back, and sent me home as damaged goods.
Cosey. Ha! ha! Oh, rare London! I beg your pardon, ha! ha! (Looking at his watch.) Egad, I must be off to Change.

[Page 68]
Trot. Ah! if I could but muster courage enough to have my own way—
Cosey. Why, that can't require much resolution.
Trot. [100]   And go into the country.
Cosey. Ah! that must require a good deal; but, zounds! be determined, and if you dislike your stylish life, sell the house, and all that's in it.
Trot. Why, I've had it but a week.
Cosey. So much the more fashionable; for now, the run to ruin is so rapid, that the upholsterer has hardly done knocking up, when in pops the auctioneer, and he begins knocking down.
                                         (Exit. Trot. What an expense! How many times must my spinning Jennies turn round, before this account is balanced. Among them I was happy;—so busy from morning to night, I had not time to eat or sleep. Ah! those jolly times are over. Here I may twirl my thumbs all day, or—
Enter Rosalie (Running.) Rosa. Oh, in mercy, save me! (Sinking down.)
Trot. A woman in distress!—Be composed: —There, there! (supporting her.)
Rosa. Oh, defend me!
Trot. That I will.
Rosa. I fear I'm pursued.

[Page 69]
Trot. No, no, you are safe. What do you [125]   fear? From whom do you fly?
Rosa. A wretch, who, by a vile stratagem, tore me from my friends—and, as he thought, secured—
Trot. Dont tremble so.—There, recover your spirits. And how did you escape?
Rosa. I'll tell you, Sir—The room I was confined in, looked into an obscure street, where I observed some workmen employed, I watched an opportunity, by signs to employ their assistance, and shewed them my purse. Fortunately they understood me, and rais'd a ladder against the window; which they forc'd open, and they enabled me to effect my escape.—I threw them their reward and fled,—but I fear, I shall be pursued.
Trot. Fear nothing. Where shall I conduct you?
Rosa. Alas! I know not—my friends live in Wales, Sir.
Trot. Well, well, my house is at hand, and I shall like it the better for sheltering you, my pretty innocent.—So, come—have you any objections to inform me who you are?
Rosa. [150]   Oh, Sir, I have no concealments— My name is Rosalie Somers.
Trot. Rosalie Somers!—Zounds. What shall I do? You must know, Miss Somers, that I had the misfortune—No, I mean simply I married into the family of the Plastics —And my wife—she—that is, perhaps—
Rosa. I understand—she would not receive me—deserted, miserable girl! (Going.)

[Page 70]
Trot. Hold! I certainly am married to Mrs. Trot; but as certainly not wedded to her opinions. And though, between ourselves, I believe I may have sunk a little the dignity of the husband, I hope I have not degraded the character of the man:—So fear nothing, I'll conduct you to the protection of a kind lady, the Honourable Mrs. Glenroy.
Rosa. Mrs. Glenroy! She is related to my dearest friends. O, thanks! thanks! Would I were there!
Trot. Why, sure you are not afraid of me?
Rosa. No, Sir; you look like a very harmless gentleman.
Trot. Egad, they would not find me so, who attempted to insult you. And so far [175]   from fearing to encounter a hundred of your fighting bloods, curse me if I think I should be afraid of meeting Mrs. Trot. I dare say, I shall look quite smart by her side. (Cocking his hat.) So, take my arm, my dear. Nay, don't hurry. We'll proceed leisurely, and enjoy the walk, and talk of this, that, and t'other. [Exeunt, arm in arm; he strutting and flourishing his cane.
SCENE III. —An Apartment in Captain Glenroy's House. Enter Reuben , preceded by Robert . Reub. Your Lady, you say, is in her own apartment.
Serv. Yes, Sir, I believe she is dressing.
Reub. I wish to speak with her.

[Page 71]
Serv. I don't think she'll be at home, Sir.
Reub. Why, s'death! don't you say, she is at home?
Serv. No, Sir; I only say, she is not out.
Reub. Pshaw! go, and acquaint her a gentleman must see her immediately.
Serv. Your name, Sir?
Reub. I'll tell her my name, Sir.—Go.                                          [Exit Robert. How changed my nature! I feel my heart contract within me, as if it shrunk from all commerce with social feeling. Let me not, however, while I lament that vice is the common shade in the portrait of the human heart —no, let me not forget that it is but the shade:—and infernal must that eye be, which dwells only on the sombre spots of the picture, blind to the warm colouring of the affections, and the glowing tints of active benevolence.
Enter Mrs. Glenroy . Mrs. G. Sir, I am quite shock'd that you should have been admitted.
Reub. [25]   Madam, I didn't mean to intrude.
                                         [Retiring. Mrs. G. Dear Sir, don't mistake. I presume you know 'tis the height of ill-breeding to let any body in, that's kind enough to inquire after one's health?
Reub. I did not know that, Madam; yet am glad to receive from your fair self the pleasing evidence that the inquiry is needless
Mrs. G. I am well, I thank you, Sir. Health is quite the fashion.

[Page 72]
Reub. Indeed! then I hope, for your sake, Madam, fashion will no longer be distinguished for its fickleness.
Mrs. G. To whom am I indebted for these kind wishes?
Reub. Madam, I am the elder brother of that miserable and degraded man, your husband.
Mrs. G. Miserable! degraded!
                                         [Indignantly. Reub. Aye, Lady.—Must he not be miserable, who risks at play what might preserve his family from ruin? Is he not degraded, who, by dissipation, contracts debts, and withholds from honest industry its hard earned pittance?
Mrs. G. Vulgar and contemptible! You [50]   the brother of Augustus?
Reub. I have confess'd it.
Mrs. G. I am sorry for it.
Reub. So am I.—But I prefer humiliation to falsehood.
Mrs. G. I would wish, Sir, to be mistress of my own time, as soon as it may suit your convenience.
                                         [Going. Reub. Madam, my business here is to serve, rather than to please; to speak the severe language of truth, not the soft blandishments of flattery. Yet, believe me, my nature (though perhaps blunt) is averse to insult; and should I prosper in snatching a beloved brother from ruin, the joy of my heart will be damp'd, indeed, if, in saving him, I forfeit your kind estimation.

[Page 73]
Mrs. G. All is forgotten —You are my husband's brother.
Reub. And your devoted friend. (Taking her hand and kissing it.) How does your sweet infant? Where is my little nephew?
Mrs. G. Quite well, and with his nurse.
Reub. Surely I am with his nurse.
Mrs. G. O, no, Sir—'tis not the fashion [75]   for ladies—
Reub. The fashion! Now is it possible a woman should be so lost to her own felicity as to lavish on a hireling the cherub smile of instinctive gratitude, which beams in the eye of infancy, while nestling on that bosom, at once the fountain of its life, and pillow of its rest? O! my young matrons, in thus estranging your little offspring, you foresee not the perdition you cause—you know not the earthly paradise you abandon.
Mrs. G. Sir—You are eloquent.
Reub. 'Tis the subject that is so: Nature wants no orator to plead her cause. Ha! a tear! Oh, hide it not! Believe me, my dear sister, no gem that sparkles in your dress is half so ornamental as that glistening drop, which your overflowing heart now shoots into your eye, endearing evidence of maternal sympathy.
Mrs. G. I feel my error. Oh! why did not your brother thus admonish, thus—
Reub. I am your friend, but he is your lover: and he who loves truly will suffer much [100]   ere he can teach his eye the scowl of discontent. Long, long will his heart throb with
[Page 74]
agony, before one groan shall disturb your slumbers, one breath of reproof ruffle your peaceful bosom.
Mrs. G. Ah! you have loved. (Reuben agitated.) Are you ill?
Reub. 'Twas nothing—'tis past. I have learnt where your husband will pass his evening. I'll bring him to you.
Mrs. G. Oh, he will not leave his party.
Reub. He shall!—He will not need compulsion to come to the wife he loves.—His fortunes are most desperate—his character, his honour—perhaps his life—implicated.
Mrs. G. Oh Heavens! in mercy do not say so.
Reub. Do you, then, love my poor brother?
Mrs. G. Better than my life, a thousand times.
Reub. Poor, did I call him? Ah! he possesses—
Mrs. G. What!
Reub. A treasure worth the empire of the world—a virtuous woman's heart. Fear nothing —All shall be well.
Mrs. G. [125]   I promised my dear Augustus to meet him this evening at a party. I shall be late.
Reub. Pray, do not go.
Mrs. G. Not go?
Reub. Come, 'tis the first favour I ever asked you.
Mrs. G. The whole world will be there.
Reub. And cannot the whole world go on
[Page 75]
without you for one night!—Hush! I heard some one lamenting.
Mrs. G. 'Tis the cry of my dear little infant.
Reub. Aye—It wants its mother. Come— I long to hold it in my arms.
Mrs. G. But my dress is unfit—
Reub. The best in the world; these gew-gaws will delight the child:—they're fit for nothing else.
                                         [Exeunt.

END OF THE FOURTH ACT.

[Page 76]
ACT V. SCENE I. —A Subscription House—an elegant supper set out—another table, on which are pens, ink, paper, &c.—An anti-chamber, with door in the centre, leading to a hazard room, &c. 1st waiter, attending on the stage—dice-box heard.— Groom-porter . (Without.) G. Por. Deuce. Ace! Caster out—
Capt. G. Fresh dice!
G. Por. Ready, Sir;—goe's amain!
Enter 2d waiter. 1st Wait. Well, what's doing?
2d Wait. The Pharo's flimsy, but there's some famous strong hazard.
Enter Reuben . Reub. So, here it is that fortune distributes smiles that madden, and frowns that destroy.— Her temple is indeed magnificent.
1st Wait. Sir, I believe, you're not a subscriber.
Reub. Neither to the place, nor to the opinion of its members. Is Captain Glenroy here.
1st Wait. Yes, Sir.
Reub. I must see him.
1st Wait. I dare not disturb him.
Reub. Indeed?—Luckily, however, I dare.

[Page 77]
1st Wait. Beg pardon, Sir; but you mustn't go there—it would be as much as my place is worth.
Reub. Then, Sir, he must come to me— His wife wants him at home. (Waiters stifle a laugh.) Why, is truth never spoken here, that you stare so, when you hear it? I must in, I see.
1st Wait. [25]   Indeed, Sir, none enter that room but gentlemen who play.
                                         (Dice box heard.) Reub. Well, I'll play.—How do they play? What do they do?—Oh, I perceive my mistake —fortune's candidates, like others, are, I suppose expected to produce their qualifications. Look here—look here. (Shewing notes.) Are not these documents excellent proofs of my eligibility to a seat there?
1st Wait. They are the right sort of thing, Sir, certainly.
Reub. I thought so. (Approaching the door.) Play! amusement! Why, to my ear, 'tis compounded of the lamentations of misery, the laugh of madness, and the execration of fiends.— What fixed despair is settled in that face!— 'Tis my brother—leave the room—begone!
                                         (Exeunt waiters. Enter Captain Glenroy . Capt. G. My fate's concluded! Ruin'd beyond hope!—Where shall I go—to my home? To conduct my wife and child to a prison.— When I reflect on what I was, and what I am! Ah! my dear father, are these the fruits of all thy
[Page 78]
pious cares? Reuben too—he happy with his Rosalie! (Reuben catches at a chair for support.) little thinks what tortures rend his wretched [50]   brother's heart—my beloved wife!—will she not hate, perhaps abandon me? Oh, for poison! (Sinks into a chair, and covers his face with his hands.)
Reub. If you love, as I have done, and she should desert you, you will not need the poison you call so loudly for.
Capt. G. Will wine give a respite to this agony? (Fills and drinks.) No, no: death, death only— (His hand falls on a knife, which he seizes.) Ah! called him, and he's here. Awful moment! Yet, let me pause—I dare not think —Fountain of mercy, pardon a wretch (Reuben seizes his arm.) Horror! do I behold Reuben?
Reub. Do I behold Augustus? Madman— suicide—brother! (falls into his arms.) Oh! to meet you thus!
Capt. G. Pity and leave me. I'm lost to happiness, to hope.
Reub. Are you lost to virtue? Look there! is that the tomb of a dear brother's honour.— (Points to the room.)
Capt. G. My soul sickens at it.
Reub. Be honest with me. Is there any thing could tempt you again to game?
Capt. G. Not empires.
Reub. Can you resolutely promise that?
Capt. G. [75]   Solemnly—And swear by that insulted power— (Bows.)
Reub. No oaths. Truth is sufficiently sacred
[Page 79]
(Takes his hand with joyful exultation.) My brother shall again know happiness.
Capt. G. Impossible!
Reub. Did I ever deceive you?
Capt. G. No; but you know not the extent of my losses—deeply involved—my commission pledged for a debt of honour—
Reub. Was it not before pledged to your country? And is it thus you discharge that debt of honour?—
Capt. G. Oh, spare me! I am indeed dishonoured.
Reub. Come, come, that too shall be redeem'd.
Capt. G Best of men! Ah, Reuben you look much altered—Tell me—
Reub. Of myself hereafter. I shall be better when I see you happy. Come, leave this accursed place:—your wife expects you.
Capt. G. I cannot join the gay circle, where she now shines.
Reub. She is at home, and with one who loves her.
Capt. G. Who loves her!
Reub. With your child, my brother—go and [100]   seek happiness where only 'tis to be found, in the bosom of your family.
Capt. G. My wife remain at home! You do not know her.
Reub. Much better than you do. You inebriate her mind with draughts of flattery, and then wonder at the want of reason yourself have caused. Instead of courting a woman's smiles by adulation, resolve by manly propriety to secure her respect; instead of being the servile
[Page 80]
echo of her opinion, be the mild, yet firm assertor of your own—Wives, my dear Augustus, may love to controul, but take my word for it, they must despise the tame obsequiousness that submits to such usurpation.— Go, go, I'll follow, and bring your benefactor to you.
Capt. G. Yet, tell me—my dear father— is he well?
Reub. Yes.
Capt. G. And how is—
Reub. No more enquiries but begone—Stay, stay—to whom have you pledged your commission?
Capt. G. To Charles Plastic.
Reub. To whom?
Capt. G. [125]   Mr. Plastic—what agitates you? Here he is.
Reub. Away, away, then—I'll soon be with you.
                                         (Exit Capt. Glenroy. Enter Plastic . Plas. Waiter, is my carriage there?
Enter 1st Waiter. Wait. Not yet, Sir.
Plas. Let me know, the moment it comes.                                          (Exit Waiter. (Sits.) —A precious lucky day I've had of it! Idiot! fool! to kick down every thing by backing out one infernal hand, and leave myself minus—I dare not think how much. Well, Glenroy's commission must go, and the rest
[Page 81]
must be raised, heaven knows where. What do you want?
Reub. So little, that I am come to enrich you.
Plas. Upon my soul, I'm very much obliged to you. Can I offer any?—
Reub. I want nothing of you but your attention. You are acquainted with Captain Glenroy?
Plas. My dearest friend.
Reub. From which dearest friend you have won that, which you must know will utterly ruin him;—
Plas. [150]   Indeed!
Reub. Dishonour him in the eyes of those honest men, who have trusted, and must suffer by him;—
Plas. Really? (Yawning.)
Reub. And make his lovely and amiable wife for ever wretched.
Plas. No, there you wrong me. Upon my honour, I mean to do all I can to make her happy.
Reub. I'm glad to hear that, however.
Plas. A precious stupid fellow I've got here.
Reub. Well, Sir, I concur with you in feeling the warmest friendship for Glenroy, only we differ a little in our mode of shewing it. He tells me he has pledged his commission to you —for how much?
Plas. A couple of cool thousands, and I should be devilish glad to see half of it
Reub. There, Sir, is the whole of it. (Presents notes.)

[Page 82]
Plas. My dear Sir, I'm under the highest obligations.—Who the devil is he! I should like to know a little more of this gentleman.— Sir, this favour is so unexpected, so opportune, I [175]   wish from my soul I could, in return, render any service, afford any information—
Reub. You could, perhaps, give me some information on a matter I am much interested in; but it would trouble you with the hearing of a dull tale.
Plas. Trouble?—on the contrary, by the honour of your confidence, my feelings would be highly gratified.—Who the devil can this be?
Reub. At all events, your curiosity shall. (They sit.) My father's fire-side was made happy by the presence of a lady, to whose surpassing virtues and accomplished mind this heart paid a homage—Sir, 'twas adoration— perhaps 'twas impious.
Plas. And her person—
Reub. Oh, the sculptor might have studied her features to improve the Medicean Venus. Her eyes, complexion, form—keep me to my story will you, for I am apt to wander. One stormy night, of more than common violence, the cry of distressed travellers reached us,—
Plas. Travellers! Where might this happen?
Reub. In Wales. Perhaps you have been there, and witnessed those sudden storms?
Plas. [200]   I have been there.
Reub. Lately?
Plas. Not very.
Reub. Oh! I rushed forth, and, at some personal peril, reached the place, where I found
[Page 83]
a gentleman extended on the ground, cold and insensible:—the drifting snow forming over him a wintry shroud.—I took him in my arms, and, strengthened by the hope of saving a fellow creature, bore him in safety to my father's house.
Plas. The man that saved my life! Thank heaven, he does not know me.—Such conduct was brave, noble—
Reub. If you please, we will call things by their proper names. 'Twas the conscientious discharge of an imperious duty, nothing more. Yet, perhaps, you'll think it claimed some little return of gratitude.
Plas. Oh, certainly.
Reub. And how was it paid?—I warmed this serpent into life—our hospitable roof sheltered him—this lady watched his bed,—he, devil-like, poured into her ear the poison of his flattery—coil'd round her unsuspecting heart— [225]   bore her from friends, from honour—devoted me to misery—to madness—
Plas. Hold! Could you not recognize his features?
Reub. No; his face was disfigured by the blood that flowed from a wound he had received in his forehead—like that. (Pointing to a mark on Plastic's.)
Plas. A scratch with a foil in exercise. 'Tis unlucky that his name should be unknown.
Reub. Ay; but his name is known.
Enter 1st Waiter. 1st Wait. Mr. Plastic, your carriage waits.
                                         [Exit 1st Waiter.
[Page 84]
Plas. Damnation! Sir, I shall take an opportunity of expressing my gratitude.
Reub. Nay, think not to escape me:—These sinews are braced by rigorous toil—The blood that rushes from this heart, flows like its feelings, warm, steady, and uncorrupted. Where is she, Sir,—Where is my—where is your Rosalie?
Plas. Sir, we this morning parted; she left me to—
Reub. And with honour?
Plas. With honour.
(Reuben expresses thanks to heaven.) Reub. One question more—Does she love you?
Plas. [250]   Does that require an answer? She left your protection for mine—I thought you had received a letter from her expressive of—
Reub. It is enough—I promised Rosalie my life should be devoted to her happiness;— the task is hard indeed; but it shall be perform'd— She has given you her heart—Sir, you must make yourself worthy of it by the only atonement in your power.
Plas. As how?
Reub. By marrying her.
Plas. Marrying her!
Reub. Surely he does not understand me. The punishment assigned you for shooting the icy bolt of death thro' this heart, which rekindled life in yours, is, to marry Rosalie Somers. To pass your life with her, to have cherubs climb your knees, that call her mother—in sickness and misfortune, to have her hand to smooth the
[Page 85]
pillow for your head, her love to soothe the sorrows of your heart. (Sits and writes.) You say you owe me gratitude: sign this, the debt is paid.
Plas. What does it contain?
Reub. [275]   A promise of marriage.
Plas. Sir, I adore Miss Somers! and were not my fortune so inadequate to—
Reub. But she is rich—immensely rich—the Cardigan estate is hers.
Plas. Indeed? the best speculation that could possibly offer.—Sir, I only wish'd the means to make her happy—and sign it with joy. [Signs.]
Reub. 'Tis done. [Recovering himself.] Do me the favour of meeting me in half an hour at our friend's.
Plas. Friend! Who?
Reub. Have you so soon forgot your dearest friend,—Glenroy?
Plas. Oh, Glenroy—I'll be punctual.
                                         (Exit Plastic. Reub. Now then to seek, and for the last time to look on her. [Looks at the paper.] Come, get acquainted here, [putting it next his heart] thou contract for Rosalie's happiness— thou warrant for Reuben's death.
                                         (Exit. SCENE II. —An Apartment in Glenroy's House—A Swing-Cradle—Nurse attending —Mrs. Glenroy , in a plain Dress, leaning over the Child—Capt. Glenroy attending. Mrs. G. He sleeps! Ah, my husband, now
[Page 86]
we are awakened from our feverish dream of folly, let it be our care by virtuous precept and more persuasive example, that the smile of content, which now plays round this infant's lips, may be continued there in riper years.
Capt. G. My sweet monitress!
Mrs. G. But don't suppose, my dear, I mean to wage vulgar war against fashion; 'tis a science, and like others, is disgraced by quacks and pretenders, and such I account those ladies who seek celebrity, by driving four in hand, staring a Captain of Grenadiers out of countenance —risking their reputation against a rouleau, or making their beaudoir resemble the interior of a licentious haram. Oh! to form a real woman of fashion, the Muses and Graces must join in sweet alliance with the Virtues. Such a character, I own, I wish to emulate, and therefore, in future, instead of always asking others if this or this be the fashion, I will frequently ask myself if it ought to be.
Enter Mrs. Glenroy's Maid . Serv. Madam, the young lady Mr. Trot brought here to day is now awake—She [25]   seems much refreshed, and intreats to see you.
Mrs. G. I'll wait on her.
                                         (Exit maid. Capt. G. 'Tis very mysterious! Pray, my love, did Miss Somers at all explain?—
Mrs. G. Dear, interesting girl, she wished it but was so agitated, and fatigued, that I positively forbad it, 'till she had taken repose —All I learnt was she was taken from
[Page 87]
your father's house by a person of the name of Maitland.
Capt. G. Reuben is strongly attached to her.
Mrs. G. Then, pray now, let me have the pleasure of telling him she's here.—
Enter Reuben and Cosey . Reub. There, Sir, there.
Cosey. Eh! egad, this is what I call comfortable?
Reub. This is your work, this is your benefactor.
Cosey. Don't thank me—my work! No, no,—I could not have managed it—To be sure, if you had been confined, and your health very bad, and the jail very damp, I might perhaps have given freedom to your body: but he has removed the chains of destructive habits, he has given health to [50]   your mind—and, dam'me, if I don't make London ring—
Mrs. G. Dear Sir, you'll wake my child—
Cosey. I say, what have you called him?
Capt. G. His name is to be Christopher.
Cosey. Nay, nay, you're joking.—What, my name? Ah! where would be the pleasure of watching the turn of the market, if it was not for thinking, when I'm laid low, that your saucy brats will point to my picture (weeps) and say that's the jolly old dog
[Page 88]
that left us all the money.—
Capt. G. Dear Sir, far distant be that hour.
Cosey. (Coming forward.) Ah, my boy!—Settling day must come to us all. But if we take care that the balance appears on the side of probity, and warm feeling to our fellow-men; doubt not but our accounts will be passed with errors excepted. —But come, Captain, you must with me, to prepare for the city in the morning.— You are set on your legs, to be sure; but we must enable you to wag them a bit, and a [75]   transfer receipt is an excellent recipe.—But zounds! Why do you hang back?
Capt. G. Sir, I have creditors there who—
Cosey. Pugh! (Producing pocket-book.) Here's ammunition enough in this old cartridge box, to blow all the bailiff's to the devil. But why did you go into the city to borrow of the Jews?
Capt. G. Because, Sir, I found them much more conscientious than Christian money-lenders.
Cosey. There, there, Reuben!—You see the city's the place, even if a man wants to be ruin'd.— [Exeunt Cosey and Captain Glenroy.
Enter Mrs. Glenroy , leans on Reuben's shoulder. Mrs. G. Well, won't you smile? You shall tho'. For, know, Sir, that to a woman of spirit a debt of gratitude is an irksome feeling.
[Page 89]
—So, I am come to clear off mine by informing you, that Miss Somers is in this house. Oh, if you don't believe, I'll soon— (Going.)
Reub. Pray, stay.
Mrs. G. Will you not see her?
Reub. Not immediately. I have taken the freedom, Madam, of appointing a gentleman to meet me here. 'Till he arrives, with your leave, I'll retire.—These rooms are hot and [100]   close—I am used to freer air.
Mrs. G. Miss Somers seems to have suffered much.
Reub. Tell her, her sufferings will soon end.—
                                         [Exit. Enter Rosalie . Rosa. Pardon, dear Madam, this intrusion; but I thought I heard a well-known voice.
Mrs. G. 'Twas Reuben Glenroy's
Rosa. Did he know I was here?
Mrs. G. Yes.
Rosa. Would he not see me?
Mrs. G. He certainly declined it. I mentioned your sufferings, he smiled, and said they would soon end.
Rosa. Smiled! Indeed, indeed, I've not deserved it. (Weeps.)
Mrs. G. Sincerely, I believe you.
Rosa. But, pray let me tell you my sad story, Madam, pray do.
Mrs. G. Were it for the removing of my doubts of your conduct, I should forbid it; but being to gratify your own delicacy, I entreat it.

[Page 90]
Rosa. Thank you, Madam.
Enter Robert . Rob. Mr. Plastic, Madam.
                                         [Exit Robert. Plas. [125]   Very well, I'll wait for him.
Rosa. Ah! (Shrieks.)
Mrs. G. What causes—
Rosa. 'Tis he, 'tis he!—The wretch that tore me from my friends.
Mrs. G. You must mistake.—This is Mr. Plastic.
Rosa. Whatever be his name, 'tis he, indeed. Oh! save me from him!
Mrs. G. You are safe.
Rosa. I tremble so—pray allow me to retire.
Mrs. G. By all means.                                          [Exit Rosalie. So, my honourable lover! I blush at my levity.
Enter Plastic . Plas. My dear Mrs. Glenroy, I am happy to meet you, to apologize for a seeming inattention—
Mrs. G. Oh, doubtless, Sir, more pleasing avocations—
Plas. Nay, that's cruel.—But you seem disturbed.—Won't you favour me with your confidence?
Mrs. G. Have you not enough of your own?
Plas. I give you my honour—
Mrs. G. How generous! having no farther [150]   occasion for it yourself—
Plas. Come, come, you know I've lost my heart.
Mrs. G. Advertise it—a small reward will
[Page 91]
bring it back—particularly, as you may safely add, 'Tis of no value but to the owner.
Plas. Madam, you compel me to be serious.
Mrs. G. I'm sorry for it, as it compels me to be so.—You are a villain!
Plas. You had better teach your husband that word.
Mrs. G. Oh, you are not worth a soldier's anger, much less a soldier's sword; and in return for the virtuous principles you aimed to instil into this thoughtless, but innocent breast, know, Sir, that when Heaven ordained that chastity should be “the jewel of our souls,” it gave for its defenders, Religion and Honour, those centinels (spite of my levity) I hope I have cherished, and can report to my beloved commander, that the citadel is impregnable. Miss Somers, Sir—You may well start, she is in that room.
Plas. Indeed?—Madam, 'tis essential to my happiness that I see Miss Somers immediately.
Mrs. G. [175]   You shall not, Sir.
Plas. What on earth can prevent me?
Mrs. G. Good breeding. (He bows.) Who after this shall dare to censure polished society, when its laws can chain him down, who would have spurn'd at all stops of virtue and honour.
Enter Reuben , Captain Glenroy , and Cosey . Capt. G. See, brother—Mr. Plastic is here—
Reub. Now then, sister, I will ask permission of Miss Somers to address a few words to her.
[Page 92]
Mrs. Glenroy leads in Rosalie. Madam, you may remember, I vowed to you, that my life should be devoted to the promoting of your happiness:—and though you have been pleased to disregard your promise, I am come to prove that I have not forgotten mine.
Rosa. Reuben!
Reub. Pray do not speak. I think, if I do not hear your voice, I shall be better able to discharge this last duty. This letter, Madam, which you addressed to me—my heart having got thoroughly acquainted with its contents —I have the honour of restoring to [200]   you.
Rosa. Ah, not signed! (Casts a look of indignation at Plastic.)
Reub. And in this paper you will find the fulfilment of your hopes, the consummation of your happiness:—and that you may be happy will be the latest wish this heart can throb with, the last petition my tongue can utter.
Cosey. And that your joy may be perfect, here are the valuable title deeds of your estate —I also wish you every—dam'it, I can't lie.
Ros. O, Madam, I shrink from the situation I am placed in.
Mrs. G. Take courage, my sweet girl— your happiness, your innocence, demands its exertion.
Rosa. Pray don't leave me! (Collects herself.) First, this, your letter, Mr. Plastic, the sentiments of which caused a blush, while my hand traced them, and from which you have basely withheld your name, I shall retain,
[Page 93]
to clear my fame, with those friends, if any such remain, who love me.
Capt. G. Did you hear?
Rosa. For this marriage promise, so singular, so unfashionable, the best service I can do [225]   will be to class it with the promises you are in the habit of making, by thus rendering it—nothing. (Tears it.) These, I am told, are of great value, alas, of none to me,—unless,— Reuben— (Bends to him, presenting the deeds.) —Rosalie will never wound the heart that loves her.
Reub. She's true— She's true!— (Rushes into her arms.) My life, my soul, my Rosalie! Sacred be our vows! eternal our loves!— (Leads her up the stage.)
Cosey. Huzza! Huzza! May you ever be as happy as—Dam'it, as I am now—Poor fellow!
Mrs. G. Poor, indeed! when I know a certain old gentleman, who intends making him his heir.
Cosey. And what right have you to suppose that old gentleman such a cursed ninny? Make him my heir! What, give him my money, when I can't see him enjoy it. No, not such a fool as that. Why, I say, you seem to be what I call rather lame-duckish.
Plas. Pray, don't suppose these accidents can affect my spirits, or shake my reputation— No! thanks to the hurry, dash, and confusion [250]   of St. James's-street, the tale will pass as rapidly as the carriage which contains the subject of it.
                                         (Exit Plastic. Cosey. You are mistaken. Distinctions between right and wrong are not yet so confounded. —And there is a test that tries the
[Page 94]
greatest of you; for, at the bottom of that same St. James's street, there stands a large, old-fashioned brick tenement, where, (thanks to its owner!) fashion has always been subjected to the strict control of decorum , and where profligacy has not dared to shew its head. ( Reuben—Rosalie —Capt. and Mrs. Glenroy —advancing.) Reuben—Rosalie—my sweet girl, accept the blessing of your old guardian, while he thus consigns you to the arms of a new one.
Reub. How shall I thank you for the inestimable gift?
Capt. G. Or how shall I express my sense of that benevolence which has saved me from ruin; and, aided by a brother's kind admonitions, taught me how to value the principles of real honour, and the charms of domestic felicity?
Cosey. No more of my benevolence, I beseech you. We are bound in this life to make each other as happy as we can, and there's an end.
Reub. [275]   Your goodness, Sir, has made us so completely happy, that our contentment can now receive but one encrease, the over-paying and encouraging reward, conferred by the approbation of our indulgent auditors.
Cosey. Ha! that would indeed make us, what I call, comfortable.

EPILOGUE. [By Colman, Mr.] Written by Mr. Colman . Enter Trot and Cosey . Trot.
There's a dispute, good folks, between us two, Cosey.
Which, with your leaves, we'll argue before you. Trot.
Now for the question. Cosey.
                                         That is soon express'd: Trot.
Namely; Cosey.
                     The Town, Trot.
                     And Country— Both.
                                         Which is best? Trot.
Give me the Country!—I shall trundle down
   With rapture! Cosey.
                                         Yes—you leave your wife in Town.
Your back once turn'd, she'll spin away your guineas;
Then who's to bring you more? Trot.
                                         My spinning jennies. Cosey.
But tell me what the Country boasts. Trot.
                                         Its hills,
Dales, lawns, and groves, and streams—for cotton-mills;
Walks through plough'd fields, to circulate your blood— Cosey.
Curse Country dirt! Trot.
                                         And, damn the London mud!
I'm for green banks, far from the deaf'ning cries
Of Dust ho! Matches! Muffins! Sweep! Hot pies! Cosey.
I'm for St. Mary Axe—remote from sounds
Of bullocks, mastiffs, asses, hogs, and hounds.
As to your banks, however green they grow,
The Bank of England is the best I know.
[Page ]
Trot.
No more of London follies, fogs, and smokes!
Place me, say I, beneath my Country's oaks;
Where, while their leaves a sacred shade dispense,
I cry,—Hail England's beauty and defence!
Whose branches decorate our hill, and plain,
Whose trunks declare us masters of the main;
Doom'd by the axe to vegetate no more,
They form the wooden walls of Britain's shore. Cosey.
Away with rural life! a life of voids!
Place me, say I, among the folks at Lloyd's;
Where, though with noise of business almost stunn'd,
I cry.—Hail, England's Patriotic Fund!
Whose store a nation's opulence imparts,
Whose aim denotes a nation's glowing hearts.
Blest wealth! that gives our wounded tars relief,
Or soothes their widows' and their orphans' grief. Trot.
Come; since the bulk of Briton's show such spirit,
Let's own both Town and Country have their merit. Cosey.
Strike hands! Agreed! Let Englishmen ne'er doubt on't,
But stick together, in the Town or out on't.
May unanimity ne'er be forgotten!
Thrive all our Trades! Trot.
                                         Particularly cotton! Cosey. (Coming forward.)
Say, then, with us, to night, if so it please ye,
Success to Town and Country! Both.
                                         And we're easy.

Front matter
TO THE PATRONS OF THE PHILANTHROPIC SCHOOL. My Lords and Gentlemen,
Should either the moral lesson intended by me to be inculcated in this play or the perusal of these few lines draw the attention of the good and great towards forwarding the truly patriotic and benevolent objects of your Institution, I shall hope to claim an humble share in the approbation you, my Lords and Gentlemen, are entitled to receive from every friend to the religion and prosperity of his country.
I beg to subscribe myself a friend to the Institution of the Philanthropic Reform, and its Patrons'
Most obedient And devoted Servant, Thomas Morton .

PROLOGUE. [By Taylor, J.] (Written by John Taylor , Esq.)
In due obedience to old Custom's right,
The Prologue comes to pay its court to-night;
But with no mean petitionary air,
Which true-born Britons must disdain to wear.
A Bard, whose Muse has gain'd your smiles before,
By hope embolden'd, ventures here once more;
Nor is that hope to vanity ally'd—
The swelling produce of o'er-weening pride;
But, rais'd upon your merits, not his own,
The grateful tribute laid at Candour's throne.
If there be critics here who come by rule
To judge our drama by the Grecian school,
From sages so profound in ancient art
Our author's simple refuge is—the heart:
To that soft Arbiter he dares appeal,
Assur'd of lenity from those who feel.
And think not, ye of nicer modern mode,
He means to 1 dramatise the penal code,
If, slighting well-bred vice, for once, he draws
A plain and homely victim of the laws;
Some latent good we in the worst might scan
To claim the sympathy of erring man.
Then blest be they 2 whose lib'ral hearts combin'd
To sooth the horrors of the guilty mind;
[Page ]

And, with a genuine philanthropic glow,
Have rescu'd Innocence from want and woe.
Amid the charities which grace our land,
Their honour'd fabric shall conspicuous stand.
No more the friendless orphan shall despair,—
Secure of shelter and of succour there:
Hence future times shall guard the hallow'd dome—
The School of Virtue, and the wanderer's home.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. —The Interior of a Pavilion attached to the Castle of Lord Avondale. Peter and other Servants employed in nailing up a large Cabinet. Mrs. Nicely seated, giving directions. Mrs. Nicely . Come , that will do; but do n't make more litter than you can help (rises) . Be it what it may, I am glad it is safely put up, however.
Peter. I say, Mrs. Nicely, should not you like to know what's in the inside?
Mrs. Nicely. Should not you, Peter?
Peter. Oh fie! no. Curiosity do n't become a servant.
Mrs. Nicely. Umph! can't it be opened, think you?
Peter. Opened—no, no.—I've been trying these two hours.
Mrs. Nicely. Indeed!—you have no curiosity; and yet you try to pick your master's locks:—now, I own I have the greatest curiosity in the world, but for the world I would not so gratify it.—Well, now every thing is in its place.

[Page 10]
Peter. Yes, Mrs. Nicely, you have fagged us prettily; and for what? Do you think his lordship thanks you for keeping every thing in its place?
Mrs. Nicely. Why, I fear there is one thing he will have no reason to thank me for, and that is for keeping you in your place, coxcomb!— (A knocking at the door.) —Go and attend the door—Whoever [25]   he be he is scraping his shoes, and that's always a good sign.
Frederick (without.) Let the carriage proceed. I have business here, and will walk to the castle. (Enters, and places on the table a port-folio.) —Aye, this is the pavilion his lordship mentioned—the cabinet, I see, is already placed—his lordship shall know your prompt attention.— (Sits, and takes a letter from the port-folio.)
Mrs. Nicely. Who is he, I wonder?
Peter. I'll tell you who he is:—his father was a thief.—
Mrs. Nicely. A thief!
Peter. A convicted felon.—
Mrs. Nicely. Poor youth!
Peter. And you know, what's bred in the bone— that's all.
Mrs. Nicely. Why, there may be something in that; for I remember, Peter, your father was an informer, and you can't help following the trade.
Fred. (Turning round.) Be good enough to take that port-folio, and accompany me to the castle. (Servants smile, whisper, and point at him.) So, so!—even here the busy tongue of fame has proclaimed my disgraceful origin—heigh ho!— Madam, I presume I address the housekeeper [50]   of lord Avondale (looking at the letter and presenting it) , Mrs. Nicely.
Mrs. Nicely. 'T is his lordship's hand; and you have kept it very nice and tidy, young man.— (Apart) I don't know what
[Page 11]
may be in the bone, but the flesh is handsome and comely, however.— (Reads) —‘My good old lady,’ —Ah! if I was as sure that I am good as I am that I am old—well, well—‘on the receipt of this, you will prepare for my immediate arrival at the castle.’—All is prepared.—‘It will be delivered to you by my private secretary: he is a youth of singular worth—to his courage I owe my life.’ (To servants) Do you hear that?—‘I need not desire you to pay him respect, as his virtues will better command it;—those of my establishment who wish to gain my regard will best secure it by endeavouring to obtain his.
‘Avondale.’
(The servants officiously take up the port-folio, and bow to Frederick .) Fred. Let it rest; I will carry it myself. I have no occasion for your attendance.
Mrs. Nicely. Don't stand scraping there, dirtying the floor; but go along, all of you, as you are bid. (Exeunt Servants.) And shall I see his lordship in good health, sir?
Fred. [75]   Perfectly so.
Mrs. Nicely. I am glad to hear it; for he has plague enough in that Parliament-house.—Why, I read the other day in the news, that he was on his legs three hours, poor man! and yet, good-natured soul! he said he was content.
Fred. The situation of this pavilion does credit to his lordship's taste—the prospect is enchanting.
Mrs. Nicely. Yes—but I believe it has a recommendation more enchanting in his eyes—for here stood the cottage of a lady he loved: I was her nurse—poor Emily!—
Fred. Was she unfortunate?
Mrs. Nicely. Aye; and though he is my master, shame on him for making her so, good dear soul!— Why, she would live a month in a room without so much as rumpling a chair-cover; and then the
[Page 12]
tears she shed!—Ah, sir, had you seen the quantity of pocket-handkerchiefs I had to wash, it would have melted your heart.—My memory fails me now, or I could tell you all about her.—It will be twenty years, come the first Wednesday in January, since he took her away—it was a fine clear frosty morning—he came about seven o'clock—
Fred. Your memory does not seem so very bad, [100]   Mrs. Nicely.
Mrs. Nicely. Yes, 'tis gone. He was not a lord then; it was before he went abroad.
Fred. But these follies of his youth are now no more.
Mrs. Nicely. Follies!—I think they used to be called vices, young man.
Fred. His lordship is about to be married.
Mrs. Nicely. I think I can remember his father's marriage; it will be nine and forty years come next Lammas—they were rather too late at the church, and—
Fred. Shall we not be too late at the castle?— you forget.
Mrs. Nicely. Aye, I do indeed!—the bride wore a white and silver neglegee— (looking out) —Heyday! what is that? Have they got a man in custody?
Fred. Yes; last night General Tarragan and his daughter were attacked by a robber: they are now taking him to the castle, till his lordship arrives.
Mrs. Nicely. Let us follow, or there will be sad dirty doings.
General Tarragan without.) Away with him, a rascal!
Fred. That is General Tarragan, who, in the [125]   Indies, has won by his sword wealth enough to offer his daughter in marriage to Lord Avondale.
Gen. His lordship not here!—then I'll see who is here— (enters.) —Why, what a gew-gaw place is this!—S'blood! a four-pounder
[Page 13]
would blow it to atoms in—Eh, who goes there?
Fred. I am—
Gen. Five feet eleven, a'n't you?
Fred. I believe so.
Gen. Well, what regiment?
Fred. I am not in the army.
Gen. Not in the army?
Fred. No, sir—I am—
Gen. Do n't trouble yourself—'t is no matter what you are.
Fred. I am a dependent on Lord Avondale.
Gen. A dependent, and five feet eleven!—hope no offence—if there be, I guess what will follow, and must take the consequences.
Fred. Quarrelling with Lord Avondale's friend would ill repay the obligations I owe—
Gen. Sir, I hope you do n't pretend to have more obligations to Lord Avondale than I have. 'Sdeath, Sir, but for Lord Avondale I should not [150]   have been worth a scar. Look here, Sir (shewing his forehead) —but for him I should not have been sent on that beautiful forlorn hope, where I was left for dead—Obligations indeed! Yes, Sir, but for Lord Avondale I might, at this moment, have been a sound, healthy, peaceable man; fit for nothing but to kill time, wound feelings, and cut up reputations with old tabbies at a tea-table.—Madam, I did not see you—hope no offence—if there be, you, doubtless, have relations; and, in that case, I guess what will follow, and must take the consequences.
Fred. (Turning round.) If death has not visited you, General, it is not for want of very kind invitations. I hope your daughter has recovered from the alarm—
Gen. What, you heard of it?—Yes, we had a
[Page 14]
pleasant sort of a skirmish—a fellow clapt a pistol to my head. My daughter screamed confoundedly, and jumped out of the carriage; but she got protection from some clodhopper—
Fred. Which was your humble servant.
Gen. The devil! Well, Sir, I've said it; I conclude an apology won't be accepted, and so—
Fred. I do not even wish you, Sir, to make [175]   one.
Gen. Don't you? Then, Sir, I ask your pardon with all my heart.—Yes, I slapped off a couple of barrels at the rascal, but I missed him: the fact is, I have not lately had the practice I could wish. —But, zounds, my Julia will get to the castle before us. I say, how do you like her?
Fred. (Turning round.) Miss Tarragan is—such harms—I—
Gen. You don't like her: well, it can't be helped.
Fred. Indeed, General, your daughter is only in danger of exciting too warm an interest.
Gen. Poor wench! she's new to England;—born in India;—none of your routing, flouting, high-fliers —all strut and streamers, like a young ensign. No, I have only to say, Open arms! First rank, kneel! down she goes; supple as a Whanyee: —that's old Tarragan's manual, my old girl.
Mrs. Nicely. Tarragan! ah, my poor head! Why, sure you can't be the son of old Tarragan the haberdasher, of Beverley?
Gen. Why, yes, I believe I am—I can't deny it.
Mrs. Nicely. Deny it! why should you? he was an honest man.
Gen. [200]   Yes, I believe he was—Come along.
Mrs. Nicely. Why, then, you must be little Joey, that went to the Indies.
Gen. Yes, I'm Joey—Come along, I say.

[Page 15]
Fred. General, can I assist you?
Gen. Assist me—damn your assistance! though you are five feet eleven. Take care of the old girl.
Mrs. Nicely. What a memory have I! Now I can't for my life recollect, whether or no there was not a little bill left unsettled at your father's—
Gen. Oh, confound your memory! I say (to Frederick) , walk fast—breathe her—that's our only chance.
                                         [Exeunt. SCENE II. —A Saloon in Avondale-Castle.                                          (Shouts without.) Enter Peter and Servants. Peter. Now, you stand there—and you, there. I think I hear the carriage—Zounds! where's Mrs. Nicely?
Enter Mrs. Nicely . Mrs. Nicely. Bless me! bless me! I hope I'm not too late. There—hold up your heads, and pull out your frills—I'm in such a pucker! (Enter Frederick .) Is his lordship coming?
Fred. Heard you not those applauding shouts? (Enter Lord Avondale and Servants.) My benefactor! Oh how sweetly must those sounds of joy vibrate on a patriot heart!
Lord Avon. Guard against its fascination, by remembering how many, to gain a nation's approbation, have parted with their own. Believe me, Frederick, unless conscience echoes back the approving plaudit, the world presents not an object more pitiable than the victim of ambition. Let those memorials I mentioned be copied.
Fred. It is already done.
Lord Avon. Good boy! thy active zeal still anticipates my wishes.

[Page 16]
Mrs. Nicely. (after having fidgetted about Lord Avondale.) Hem! hem!
Lord Avon. Mrs. Nicely, I heartily rejoice to see you bear your years more as an ornament than a burthen.
Mrs. Nicely. [25]   I am pretty well, thank your honour, excepting that my memory is gone.
Lord Avon. I am not very sorry to hear that. (Apart.)
Mrs. Nicely. Your lordship came through the hall?
Lord Avon. Yes, and marked your diligence.
Mrs. Nicely. The old rusty armour and shields now look like a row of nice pewter dishes. It is a pretty sight.
Lord Avon. Enough to drive an antiquary mad.
Mrs. Nicely. And the colours that came from abroad, all torn to rags with bullets, I've had them so neatly darned and scoured, that nobody would suppose they had ever been out of the parish. And, my lord, I have placed the cabinet in the pavilion, just where the window used to be where poor Emily sat when—
Lord Avon. Silence! I thought your memory was gone. Is it not enough that I never can forget?
Mrs. Nicely. It will break my heart if I've offended you. Bad as my poor head is, I must to the grave remember your lordship's kindness.
Lord Avon. Nay, nay, I meant no anger;—do [50]   not kneel, I insist.
Mrs. Nicely. Well, dear master! I won't. As there is no carpet, it might dirty my apron, to be sure.
Lord Avon. You will now see my bride.
Mrs. Nicely. Well, she won't be handsomer than Emily was.

[Page 17]
Lord Avon. Again!—fie! fie! (Enter General Tarragan and Julia .) General Tarragan, a thousand welcomes!
Gen. There, my lord: my girl and my fortune are all I possess;—they are yours. (Taking his daughter's hand, and presenting her to Lord Avondale.)
Lord Avon. To intrude on you, at this moment, professions of regard, would insult feelings that even now seem wounded; but there are professions which may be made with delicacy and heard with pleasure—those of friendship, lady: in the character of friend alone, honour me with your consideration, till you may be pleased to change it for one more endearing.
Julia. My lord, I am highly sensible of your goodness—attribute my agitation to the alarm I last night suffered.—My father's will to me is—
Gen. Martial law.
Lord Avon. Is she not beautiful?
Fred. (Turning round.) [75]   She is, indeed.
Gen. But, my lord, my people have got the rascal that wanted to blow me to the devil: you had better commit him, and put him out of his misery.
Lord Avon. Well remembered: Frederick, prepare for his examination;—but hold, I ought to make you acquainted with this worthy youth.
Gen. Oh, we have met; and the young dog had a mind to pick a quarrel with me.
Fred. My Lord, on my honour—
Julia. I last night benefited by this gentleman's protection;—his delicate attentions I must ever remember with gratitude.
Gen. And I'll return the obligation:—I will, Sir, for all your proud menacing looks: I guess what you would be at. So, my lord, tell me his family.

[Page 18]
Lord Avon. At present we will have that subject —there is a difficulty.
Fred. (Turning round.) My lord, pardon me; my soul abhors mystery and concealment— My story is soon told. I— (is overcome by his feelings, then, collecting himself, proceeds) —In me you behold the son of a criminal!
Julia. [100]   A criminal!
Fred. Even so: my father's name is not known to me; for in my earliest infancy he was, for his crimes, banished his native land.
Julia. O Heaven! and were you left to meet the desertion of an unfeeling world?
Fred. No, lady. I was left to meet the special protection of Heaven; for by those generous men —those guardians of infant virtue—I was snatched from infamy, and placed at the Philanthropic School; there, soon as the dawn of reason chased away the dreams of childhood, I endeavoured to repay the blessings bestowed on me by diligence, emulation, and gratitude.
Gen. Bravo!—why they made you a philosopher.
Fred. Sir, I am indebted to them for a nobler title; for they made me a Christian. Some time since, Providence blessed me by making me its instrument in preserving the life of Lord Avondale; and how has he rewarded me? he has placed me near his person—he has asked me to call him friend.—Oh! if the devotion of this life—
Lord Avon. Dear Frederick! no more.
Fred. One moment. 'T is true, I think of my birth with grief, but till vice can be proved hereditary [125]   I will not think of it with shame: if virtue be an inmate in this breast, shall I basely scorn the fostering hands that placed it there?—no, rather let me proclaim that my protectors were the noblest spirits of the land. O generous imperial Britain!
[Page 19]
look proudly round; and, while other nations boast their Pantheons of Gods, do thou display thy princely endowments for calamity—thy palaces for poverty. I've talked too long—pray pardon me; but oh! this heart—this grateful heart—was bursting!
                                         [Exit. Gen. Damn that fellow, to make an old woman of a general! (wiping his eyes) . Oh, if they had but made him a drummer, by this he might have been a hero—and as dead as Alexander the Great.
Julia. Dear father, what a horrid thought!— how fortunate is he in so noble a patron!
Lord Avon. His merit steps before his fortune; for if, proudly blossoming on the tree of hereditary honour, so many produce only the fruit of vice, how greatly should he be esteemed in whose breast (spite of the uncultivated soul, the nipping blasts of adversity, and the foul and poisonous weeds that envelope it) virtue takes firm root; and, warmed by the divine ray of our religion, gives produce [150]   grateful to Heaven—a blessing to mankind!
                                         (Noise without.) Julia. Here comes the criminal!—allow me to retire.
Lord Avon. Honour me with your hand. This good lady will attend you.
Mrs. Nicely. Aye, that I will.—What a neat pretty creature!
Lord Avon. “The agitation he has caused you, fair creature! will not tend to soften my resentment.”
Julia. “Oh, my lord!—but I will not fear that I can aggravate his suffering; for Lord Avondale's dispensations of justice must ever be tempered by mercy.”
                                         [Exeunt Lord Avondale, Julia , Mrs. Nicely , and attendants. Gen. So, here comes Scapegrace!

Enter Frederick with Tyke , in custody of black servants. Fred. You may now unbind him. (Takes out a pocket-book.)
Tyke. Ah, do; for ease, you know, is every thing. (They unbind him) Aye, now we're all alike —and that makes company pleasant. Give me my hat, though;—for I wish to be mannerly; and a hat helps a body a bit. (Moving his hat about.)
Fred. Well, fellow!—behold the vile situation to which you have brought yourself.
Tyke. No, Sur, do n't say that; because I did not bring myself—they brought me: bless you! I did not wish to come.—I just mention it, 'cause right 's [175]   right.
Fred. From whence do you come?
Tyke. Fra t' other side of watter—I come fra abroad.
Fred. Your name?
Tyke. Why my name 's Bobby.
Fred. Your surname?
Tyke. Oh! I understand, mun—Tyke.
Fred. Robert Tyke?
Tyke. Yes.
Gen. You have occasionally changed your name?
Tyke. Nay, never: sister changed hurs when she were married—but then I never was married. This is a very pretty room—do n't you think so?
Fred. Insolent!
Tyke. Oh no, sur; I civilly thought you might like to change conversation: too much of one thing, you know—
Fred. If you have partners in your guilt, and will make full confession, you may probably be admitted king's evidence.

[Page 21]
Tyke. You do n't say so? That must be mighty grand indeed! Me king's evidence! I'm much obliged to you; but I do n't rightly know why [200]   they 've brought me on a visit to this lord, like— because I've not the pleasure of his acquaintance.
Fred. Indeed! more knave than fool, I find.
Gen. Well, scoundrel!—
Tyke. Sur, I ax pardon; but consider I'm no' but a stranger; and saying scoundrel is rather macking free at first sight, I think.—
Gen. But at first sight you clapt a pistol to my head, and be damned to you! I'll trounce you, you black rascal!
Tyke. You hear what your master says to you?
Fred. And you shall hear what Lord Avondale will say to you.
Tyke. But now, why should we trouble his lordship? I'm sure if you will propose any thing at all in reason, you'll not find me fractious.
Gen. Go to the devil!
Tyke. Ecod, I seem to have got there already.—
Gen. Here comes my lord.
Enter Lord Avondale . L. Avon. Where is the prisoner?
Tyke. Aye, where 's prisoner? My lord wants to know where prisoner is.— (They bring Tyke forward; Lord Avondale, on seeing him, starts; Tyke looks at him with an eye of recognition.)
L. Avon. It is impossible—Yet those features—
Tyke. [225]   If it should—but, no, it can't be—
L. Avon. What is the prisoner's name?
Fred. Robert Tyke.
L. Avon. It is the man!—How shall I proceed?

[Page 22]
Tyke. I'm dommed, but it's him! Oh, then all's just as nice as nine-pence. (Apart, and snapping his fingers.)
L. Avon. This man a robber?—impossible!
Tyke. Quite foolish to suppose it.
L. Avon. I know him well. He is my tenant.
Tyke. Yes; and if I had been a rogue, 'tis very likely you would have trusted me, as you did, with—
L. Avon. Very large sums of money. General, can you swear that this man presented a pistol to your breast?
Gen. Oh no, my lord! I can't see very well by day, and it was as dark as the devil.
L. Avon. What evidence, then, have you of his guilt?
Tyke. We have not got ony at all, sur.
Fred. Silence!
Gen. Why, when I fired, the robber fled into a wood; and my servants found this fellow perched [250]   on a tree.
Tyke. Yes, that's right enough—that 's no lie.
Gen. Lie! Oh that you were a gentleman!
Tyke. Thank you, sur; perhaps you could help me to someit in that line?
L. Avon. How came you, fellow, on that tree?
Tyke. Sur—my lord, I mean—you was not a lord tho' when—
L. Avon. When you were my tenant?—no: go on.—
Tyke. Why, I was taking alone by myself a salutary walk, thinking of what not—about the moon and cheeses, and politics, and pigs, and things I'm acquainted with like—quite natural, you know—when I heard a shooting off o' gunpowder; so, says I to myself, without speaking tho', as sure as my name 's Bob, here's a parcell of rogues or smugglers, gammering and fighting, and
[Page 23]
ecod an honest man may get himsel shot among em; so I clavvered up a tree—quite natural, you know.—
L. Avon. This is far from improbable.
Tyke. Very far. 'Tis highly improbable, I assure you.
L. Avon. A word—You have certainly mistaken the man. A victorious General [275]   becoming the prosecutor of a felon would not, perhaps, be very agreeable?
Gen. No;—I should not like it. I say, send him about his business.
L. Avon. There are suspicions; but—
Gen. Suspicions do n't become a gentleman.
L. Avon. Perhaps he might again attack you.
Gen. Do you think he would? (Apart) That 's just what I should like. Let him go; I won't prosecute: only let him go, that 's all.
L. Avon. Frederick, the evidence adduced being too slight to place the life of man in danger, or injure his character by unfounded accusation, he is discharged.
Fred. Discharged!
L. Avon. Yes, sir, discharged! (with severity.) Unless your superior judgment and authority change the determination.
Fred. 'Tis very strange;—discharge the prisoner!
Tyke. That 's me—I'm prisoner, I know.
Fred. You may depart.
Tyke. Thank you, sur. I'm sorry to break up company like— (going.)
L. Avon. Hold! (To Tyke apart) This time you have escaped; but if again—
Tyke. [300]   Oh! why should I? I shall want for nothing now, you know. He! he! I was varry glad to see you, sir—my lord; for I do n't suppose among strangers my innocence would have stood me in much stead—I do n't indeed.
L. Avon. Be prudent. Frederick, at more leisure
[Page 24]
I mean to admonish this man respecting his future conduct;—convey him to a secure apartment, and let him not converse with my people. Come, General; your lenity does credit to your feelings.
Gen. My lord, I'll not contradict you, because it may lead to unpleasant consequences.
                                         [Exeunt Lord Avondale and General Tarragan . Fred. What should this mean?—I am ready to attend you.
Tyke. Sir, 't is too much—really too much—
Fred. Go before—
Tyke. Upon my honour, I'm quite shocked like—ha! ha! ha! But if I must—why— (puts on his hat.)
                                         [Exeunt.

END OF THE FIRST ACT.

[Page 25]
ACT II. SCENE II. —The House. A Pleasure-ground of Mrs. Ferment's. Mrs. Ferment is discovered at the Top of the Stage, adjusting some Flowers. Enter Timothy from the House. Timothy. Dear , dear, where can mistress be!—My master is in such a combustion and a passion — (Mrs. Ferment advances). —Madam, my master wants to see you directly; he says he has a plan—
Mrs. Fer. A plan—you mean a hundred.—Very well, I'll come. (Moves the other way.)
Tim. That's a queer way of coming.—
Mrs. Fer. Did you not hear me, Sir? (Exit Timothy.) A plan, indeed! heigh-ho! unless I take care, this good man of mine, by his profound penetration and superior foresight, will absolutely run blindfold into ruin.
Re-enter Timothy . Tim. My master, madam, is quite angry with me, because you won't come:—now, madam, that's not my fault you know, because—
Mrs. Fer. Silence!—Has Miss Tarragan returned from Avondale castle? Oh, I see her carriage. (She kisses her hand.) Tell your master I'll come presently.
Tim. I have told him that, but—
Mrs Fer. Don't you hear, Sir?                                          [Exit Timothy.
[Page 26]
(Enter Julia .) My dear girl, welcome back!—Well, all quiet there? (Pointing to Julia's heart.) Eh! were you not dazzled [25]   with the splendid emanation of his Lordship's diplomatic fame?
Julia. “His politeness was extreme.”
Mrs. Fer. “Oh! that's all.”
Julia. “The compliments he paid me were delicate; but so cold—”
Mrs. Fer. “As to convince you that his heart and understanding were at that moment employed on some foreign embassy.—Well, my love, and is the happy day fixed?”
Julia. (Looking down.) Oh madam!
Mrs. Fer. My sweet girl! pardon me; I am shocked at my levity—But, tell me, does this projected alliance render you miserable?
Julia. Oh! truly so.
Mrs. Fer. I have not the honour of his Lordship's acquaintance, but am convinced he never will press the fulfilment of an engagement which would entail misery on one so lovely and amiable.
Julia. (Looking down.) Do you think so?—Ah! but then my father is determined.
Mrs. Fer. And are you determined to obey?
Julia. You know, madam, I must obey my father, as much as if he were my husband.
Mrs. Fer. Umph! Why, as much as that perhaps [50]   you may; but there are instances, my love, where even husbands are not always obey'd.
Enter Timothy . Tim. My master, madam, insists on it you come to him.

[Page 27]
Mrs. Fer. I cannot come—I'm engaged—say so. (Exit Timothy.) Ha! ha! rather an apt illustration.—
Julia. Govern a husband!
Mrs. Fer. Yes.
Julia. But how is it done?
Mrs. Fer. What a question!—of course by the tongue.
Julia. Ha! ha! I have heard, indeed, that its voluble exertion will achieve—
Mrs. Fer. Nothing, positively nothing;—on the contrary, I maintain that its flexibility is the grand cause of female subjugation.—Words, my love, give animation to the contest; there's blow for blow, and, the weapon not being fatal, victory is seldom obtained—but, to sullen inveterate silence what can Be opposed?—My motto is—Be dumb, and conquer.
Julia. I wonder, then, silence is not more practised.
Mrs. Fer. Oh! my dear child, 'tis very difficult —even I, anxious, of course, for the honour of my system, can hardly keep my tongue quiet—I [75]   do so long to prattle that, upon my honour, I am forced sometimes to give it a bite.
Julia. Ha! ha!
Mrs. Fer. My dear young friend! I don't mean to make a rebel of you; but if you honour us with your company a few days, I think you will be convinced that a woman may sometimes govern with propriety.— [Tim. (Speaks in the house.) Yes, Sir—she's in the garden.]— Ah! here he comes! Fly, my love, fly—for it would be cruel in me to allow you to anticipate the joys of matrimony.—Now for a duet, which I fear will be distinguished rather by its spirit than its harmony, and will probably end in a solo by my dear
[Page 28]
crazy husband.—Pursue this walk, and I'll come to you presently—look here—this way.
                                         [Exeunt. Fer. You are sure she's here.—
Timothy. (Without.) Yes. Sir.
Ferment enters from the House—Papers in his Hand-others sticking out of his Pocket— Timothy follows. Fer. So, madam, I must come to you—must I?— Why did you say my wife was here?
Tim. Why, Sir, I sure she was—if you'll allow me, Sir, only to—
Fer. Don't be tedious.
Tim. Sir, I only—
Fer. Blockhead! don't you know you address a [100]   man of penetration and talents?
Tim. I'm sure I ought to know, for you have told me so a hundred times.—There's a man in the hall waiting for you—'tis—
Fer. I know who it is—'tis the churchwarden.
Tim. No, Sir, it is not; 'tis—
Fer. I know it is Mr. Visto, the author of the picturesque and beautiful—
Tim. No, Sir, it is not the picturesque and beautiful gentleman—'tis Dr. Oxygen, the man that cures folks by giving them airs to drink—
Fer. True, Timothy; and I mean to be his patient.—
Tim. Don't, Sir.—Lord, I'm sure you can give yourself airs plenty.—
Fer. Silence!—Give the doctor this certificate of cures.
Tim. Yes, Sir— (Reading and going.) —Mortality bill for the year—
Fer. You stupid rascal! you have got the wrong paper.
Tim. Yes, Sir—I ax pardon for your giving it me— (Mrs. Ferment appears again.) —Sir, here is—

[Page 29]
Fer. I know—'tis my wife. (Timothy smacks his hands together.) What did you mean by that?
Tim. I'll be shot if for once you have not guessed [125]   right.—
Fer. For once guessed right!—begone!— (Exit Timothy.) —What a misfortune to possess talents penetration, foreknowledge, and be surrounded by a parcel of ignorant—
Mrs. Fer. hem!—
Fer. I think, madam, you might have attended my summons a little sooner.— (She shakes her head.) — Aye, that means no! (She nods.) Ah, that means yes! —but why not say so?—damn it, there can't be much trouble in saying—yes— (She smiles.) —Ah my dear wife! never shall I forget what you said last July was a twelvemonth.—You said, and I thought it the music of the spheres, that nothing was so delicious as a congenial interchange of sentiment.
Mrs. Fer. I think so still.
Fer. She speaks—now for a charming prattle— you think so still?
Mrs. Fer. Yes, my dear; and provided you talk reasonably—
Fer. Certainly.
Mrs. Fer. And don't contradict—
Fer. I never do—there I must contradict you— Now tell me, when did I ever contradict my dear wife?—This is delightful, ‘the feast of reason [150]   and the flow of soul.’ Well, how go on the improvements? —Now here, for instance— (Looking towards the audience.) —the hot-house—charming, is it not?—The choicest gems of nature nurtured by the refined hand of art, lovely to behold, but difficult to collect them—the beauties seem rather crowded though—
Mrs. Fer. I should be very sorry to part with one of them.
Fer. I don't wonder at it.—That approach to
[Page 30]
the left is infernal—we must plant laurels by thousands.—
Mrs. Fer. Why, indeed, the planting of laurels becomes rather a necessary duty, when so many of our gallant countrymen are determined to gather them.—
Fer. Oh! pretty, pretty!
Mrs. Fer. But instead of laurel-trees, bay-trees, or pedigree-trees, I could mention a tree that I fear, husband, you will never cultivate—and yet it is the parent stock from which these scions proudly flourish.
Fer. Indeed!
Mrs. Fer. it is called, my dear, the tree of industry;—its soil is liberty—its root is integrity [175]   —its stem is independence—its branches are benevolence —its blossoms are honours—and its fruit —a plum.
Fer. How she talks! But you like this plan of pulling down the house—putting a hundred acres under water?—
Mrs. Fer. No.
Fer. Why, my love? explain in full—be ample, my darling.
Mrs. Fer. Because we cannot afford the expence —indeed, my dear George, if you would turn your attention to the means of increasing our fortune instead of diminishing it—consider our children.
Fer. Oh bless you, my very thoughts—that's sympathy—what I call the nuptials of the soul.— Sit down, my darling Fanny! I've such a plan! You know, my love, that my relative Miss Tarragan is about to be married to Lord Avondale. (She nods.) Nay, hang it, don't do that!— (Imitating.) —as the man says in the play, ‘If thou canst nod, speak too.’
Mrs. Fer. Very well.
Fer. Then I shall be introduced.—
Mrs. Fer. Very well.—

[Page 31]
Fer. You know I'm a devilish clever fellow.—
Mrs. Fer. No, I don't.
Fer. [200]   Yes, you do—and Lord Avondale is a first rate—a monstrous great gun.—Now his interest, backed by a few thousands, for which we could mortgage our estate— (She shews symptoms of discontent) —would obtain me a seat in a certain assembly, which, with my talents, would lead to— (pause.) —Eh!—now what do you say? it would lead to— (pause.) —Dumb again!— (She turns her chair from him, and looks at an ornament suspended at her breast.) —That's my hair in the locket, is not it? (loud) —Don't you hear? (pause, greatly irritated.) Allow me, madam, to ask you one question, which is—What the devil's the use, when I can't get an answer?—You are a scandal to your sex, do you hear that? I'll be divorced—'tis a new case.—I'll be divorced, I tell you. Now what have you to say to that! eh? (pause.) Blockhead! to explain my grand designs to such a ninny—I've done with you.
Enter Timothy , who whispers Mrs. Ferment . Mrs. Fer. Very well—I'll come—
Fer. Eh?—very—what did you say, my dear?— What do you want, Sir?
Tim. My mistress will inform you, Sir.
                                         [Exit. Fer. Will she? Well, if she will I shall be much obliged— (Exit Mrs. Ferment into the house.) —Gone! Oh I shall go mad!—I wish I could hate [225]   her.—Now must I abandon all my delicious plans, or I shall never get another word from her— (listens) —She's coming back: oh ho! she relents—now I must manage this in my best manner—I won't condescend to look at her.—
[Page 32]
(Enter General Tarragan .) So, you've thought proper to return—pretty time to quarrel indeed, as if I should not have plague enough with that old absurd General! Sit down—I must let you into his character; you don't know him— I do— (General seats himself.) —He talks devilishly about fighting, but I have my doubts—a word in your ear— (Turning round, sees General Tarragan.)
Gen. And a word in yours—you may satisfy your doubts directly.
Fer. Devilish comical, was not it?—I thought it was my wife; and it is very hard that a man can't say what he pleases to his own wife—Ha! ha!—you don't dislike a joke, my dear General?
Gen. Not if it's a good one—but I can't say much for yours.
Fer. Indeed!—then say no more about it. (Apart.) Well parried.—Did you meet my wife?
Gen. Yes—a very fine woman—perhaps you don't think so?—
Fer. Oh yes, I do—I adore her; but—
Gen. [250]   But—ah! there's always a but .
Fer. Did she speak a little to you?
Gen. Certainly.
Fer. Happy fellow!
Gen. Oh! what she's apt to speak too much to you?
Fer. No; damn it! she won't speak at all.— My dear cousin, considering how very few silent wives there are, 'tis devilish hard that I should be cursed with a dummy.—
Gen. Why, I own your case is singular; but I'll give you a bit of advice, I have often received advice from you—
Fer. You have been so fortunate.

[Page 33]
Gen. And bad enough it was.
Fer. Nay, don't say that.
Gen. Well, I won't; but it was very bad.—
Fer. That is not fair.
Gen. I own it is not—but damned bad it was, to be sure.
Fer. Nay.
Gen. Well, tell me—does she ever talk?
Fer. Oh, yes, sometimes!
Gen. Then mark—when she's inclined, don't let her.
Fer. [275]   Not let her! 'tis my delight—the solace of—
Gen. Never mind; when she begins do you thunder, gabble away, never stop—How are your lungs?
Fer. Pretty well.
Gen. Don't give it up—Suppose you go and rehearse —the water mill's going—very pretty double for a lady's prattle.
Fer. But, my dear General, when am I to be introduced to the Peer?—I pant for the interview— the public ought and shall benefit by my powers. I mean to get into Parliament (in a loud whisper).
Gen. Why, you'll have no want of conversation there.—
Fer. True; and married men make the best members—they bear contradiction with a good grace—never in a hurry to call for the question, and get home—so—But you must own that my advice never did you any harm.
Gen. Well, I own it never did; for, to say the truth, friend Ferment, damme if ever I took it.
                                         [Exeunt.
[Page 34]
SCENE III. —An Apartment in Avondale Castle. Enter Lord Avondale ; he pauses, then proceeds to the opposite Door and opens it. Enter from it Tyke . Lord Avon. Come hither—How is this, Robert? When I left England you were a youth, whose example was pointed out as an object of imitation —your morals were pure, your industry exemplary —how is it then that I now see you an abandoned outcast?
Tyke. Ah, Sur, it was all along we' you.
Lord Avon. Me! was not my bounty ample? did I not give you independence?
Tyke. Ah, that was it—when you sent me that little child to take care on—
Lord Avon. Hush!
Tyke. Well, well;—and that big lump of money! you see, as I had not worked for it, it made me quite fidgetty; I always had my hand in my pocket, scrummelling it about like—so, as all Yorkshire lads like gallopping horses, I bought one, and took't to races, up at our country side—and, ecod! I pulled stuff into my hat as clean as nine-pence. Oh, ho! says I, I'll make short work o'this; I'll go to Newmarket, where the Lords do bring their cattle, and settle matters in a hurry. So I went, and mighty pleased I was; for the Jockey Lords called me Squire, you see—and clapping me on [25]   the back in this manner, says, Squire, your horse will beat every thing!
Lord Avon. Indeed!
Tyke. Yes, yes—that was pleasant enough; but, unluckily, the Jockey Lords told me a damned heap o'lies; for ma horse always cam in lag -last. —Then they told ma to hedge; but it was not
[Page 35]
the hedging I had been used to and somehow I got intid ditch like.—So what with that and playing cards at Lambs skinnings (for, bless you, I could not catch them at Snitchums) I was—
Lord Avon. Ruined.
Tyke. Yes; as Jockey Lords said—completely cleaned out.
Lord Avon. Did you not return to honest labour?
Tyke. Oh, no, I could not—my hands had got soft and smooth, and I had a ring girt about my finger:—no, I could not tak to work.—
Lord Avon. Go on.
Tyke. Why, as I could stay there no longer, I thought it would not be a bad plan to go away— so I went intid stable, and, would you believe it? the horse that beat mine sometimes coax'd, and contrived to get me on his back like—and, ecod! gallopped off wi'me a matter of a hundred miles. [50]   —I thought no more about it myself—
Lord Avon. But they did.
Tyke. Yes, dom them, and were very cross indeed; for they put me intid castle, and tried me at sizes.
Lord Avon. What could you say to avert your fate?
Tyke. Why, I told the Judge—says I, My Lord, I hope you'll excuse my not being used to this kind of tackle—exchange is no robbery—mistakes of this kind will happen—but, I assure you, I've kept the best of company we' Jockey Lords, and such like as yourself.—So they all smiled, as much as to say, he's one of us like—and I thought all was right enough:—but the Judge puts him on a black cap, and, without saying with your leave, or ony thing, orders me to be hanged!—
Lord Avon. Poor wretch!
Tyke. Don't you be frightned; they did not hang
[Page 36]
ma' mum—dont'e believe that;—no, bless you, they sent ma' to Botany Bay for fourteen years.
Lord Avon. Where, I hope, you remained, resigned to your fate.
Tyke. Oh! quite resigned—for I could not get away:—I dare say I tried a hundred times.
Lord Avon. [75]   Why did not I know this?—Had you sent to my house—
Tyke. I did send to your house.
Lord Avon. Well!
Tyke. Why, they wrote word, I think, that you had been called up to t'other house—but then I did not know where that was—and that you was sent abroad by government:—I was sorry to hear that, because I knew what that was by myself like—not that it surprised me, because I heard of your always being at Cockpit , and I guessed what that would end in.
Lord Avon. Pshaw!—Come hither; tell me— I dread to ask it—that child—where—hush! we are interrupted—retire into that room.
Tyke. Certainly; oh, you'll find me quite an agreeable companion like.—There seems some varry pratty clothes of yours in that room.—I should not wonder at all if one of them coats would fit me—for we're a good deal alike as to person and manner, I think.—
Lord Avon. Well, well—go in, go in.                                          [Exit Tyke. (Enter Frederick .) Frederic, welcome!—you must execute a commission for me. Look here, this is my portrait, painted many years since; present it to my lovely bride— [100]   Why do you start?
Fred. My Lord, I am ill suited to the task.
Lord Avon. By no means. This marriage, Frederick,
[Page 37]
is of the highest import to my happiness and honour.—The claims made on the purse of him who boasts the people's favour, few fortunes can uphold—mine has sunk beneath them;—and, but for this wealthy alliance, obloquy might foully spot the proud name of Avondale:—therefore, good Frederick, you must be my advocate.
Fred. What!—I plead another's passion! (apart.) Indeed, my Lord, I shall disgrace your cause.
Lord Avon. Is it then much to praise a friend, who perhaps has merited your praise?
Fred. Oh no! (taking the picture) ; on that theme doubt not my zeal.—I fly to know my duty. (Going, returns.) I had forgot—General Tarragan begs a few minutes' conversation. It seems, as well as I can collect from his discourse, that he has conducted to England a Mrs. St. Clair, in whose cause he wishes to interest your Lordship.
Lord Avon. She may command my services: how are they to be directed?
Fred. She wishes, as I understand, to institute an enquiry respecting the child of a deceased friend, [125]   a Mrs. Radnor.
Lord Avon. Radnor!
Fred. It is your Lordship's family name.
Lord Avon. Yes; that occasioned my surprise.—Where did the General meet this Lady?
Fred. On the confines of Spain;—she resided many years in the convent where Mrs. Radnor died.
Lord Avon. Died! (Seems in thought.)
Fred. Shall he attend you here?
Lord Avon. Yes; no.—
Fred. He means to publish the particulars, and offer a large reward.—
Lord Avon. Not for the world!—
[Page 38]
(recovering.) —that is, I would not advise it. Bring me to him—hold—is he alone?
Fred. He is attended by Mr. Ferment, your neighbour.
Lord Avon. Ferment! I know him not; I must see him alone—tell him so, good Frederick.
Fred. He will be rejoiced to hear how much your Lordship is interested in the cause of his fair friend.
Lord Avon. I am interested— (Exit Frederick.) — [150]   —oh, deeply interested.—Should it be so, what follows?—ruin, shame, dishonour—Oh, guilt! guilt!
                                         [Exit. Ferment peeps through the Door, looks about, then enters. While his Lordship is engaged with the General, no harm in taking a peep—Charming rooms!—fit for expanded genius, like mine:—here I shall meander through these enchanting labyrinths, till I reach the closet—the sanctum sanctorum—the— eh! somebody in that room: it would be cursed mal-a-propos to stumble on the Peer before I'm introduced —But he's safe with the General, so never mind.
(Enter Tyke , in a different Coat.) Sir, your most devoted servant.
Tyke. Same to you, Sir; same to you.
Fer. Odd figure!—Oh, I see at once who he is —great county man, in the commission—yet well with him—may be useful. Sorry, Sir, the robbery was not brought home to that rascal.
Tyke. Are you? Now there we differ.

[Page 39]
Fer. Indeed!—You who are used to the sessions must know these things better than I. Your friend Lord Avondale is a great character, extremely popular:—Did you hear his last speech?
Tyke. No; I don't myself much fancy last speeches.
Fer. In the country, perhaps?
Tyke. [175]   No, I was out of the country.
Fer. Abroad?
Tyke. Yes.
Fer. What, run out a little, eh—rather out at the elbows?
Tyke. A good deal.
Fer. You'll excuse me; but I see things in a moment.—What—cards, hazard—ah, my dear Sir, you should have got some friend to have tied you up.
Tyke. You think so? Why I could have got that done fast enough.
Fer. But I suppose you were determined to take your swing.
Tyke. Not exactly; but I did not go abroad on that account.
Fer. Oh, I know it in a moment—ill health?
Tyke. Why, I certainly should have died if I had stayed.
Fer. Indeed!—Oh, my dear Sir, in this world we must all have our trials, and you have had yours.
Tyke. I have.
Fer. Suffer much confinement?
Tyke. A good deal.
Fer. You of course were properly attended; you [200]   had good judges of your case?
Tyke. They were reckoned so; I did not much fancy them myself.—
Fer. And they said a voyage would save you?
Tyke. To a certainty.

[Page 40]
Fer. You must have been transported at the news?
Tyke. I was.
Fer. Has it cured you? (Offering a pinch of snuff.)
Tyke. I don't know, I think I feel some of my old symptoms— (Takes the box.) —This is a varry pratty box—I've lost mine.
Fer. Do me the honour to use that—till— (Apart) If he would but keep it!— (Tyke puts it in his pocket) —he has—My dear Sir, you have doubtless considerable interest with Lord Avondale.
Tyke. Why, I believe he would not much like to offend me.
Fer. Lucky fellow!— (apart.) —My name, Sir, is Ferment; by and by I shall be introduced to the peer.—You know business—a word thrown in by you would prevent my being in the wrong box— eh? (Tyke winks and nods.) —I apprehend you.
Tyke. You apprehend me, do you? (Alarmed.)
Fer. That is, I conceive—I understand—ah, [225]   Sir, you don't know me.
Tyke. No, I don't; and you don't know me.
Fer. Yes, I do; you are a generous disinterested gentleman—I can see what others can't.
Tyke. Yes, you can.
Enter Lord Avondale unobserved by Ferment . Lord Avon. Ah! whom have we here? (Apart.)
Fer. As for the peer, you'll see how I'll manage him. I'll worm into his secrets.—I say, which is the weak side—where is he ticklish?
Tyke. Ticklish!—I'm sure I never tried.
Fer. Never mind; I know.—Between ourselves— I see the whole man as plain as if he stood before
[Page 41]
me. (Lord Avondale has placed himself close to Ferment's chair.)
Tyke. Why, for that matter, so do I.
Fer. I'll soon find the right place to tickle him. (Turns round, sees Lord Avondale at his elbow, who eyes him with severity—Ferment attempts to speak, but cannot—Lord Avondale advances—Ferment escapes at the door where he entered.)
Lord Avon. Worm into my secrets!—What does he mean? Who is he?
Tyke. He calls himself Ferment.
Lord Avon. I shall remember him.
Tyke. He gave me this box, to speak a good word for him like—he seems but a silly bad sort of chap, I think.
Lord Avon. At present he is not worth a thought —for I have received information that alarms— distracts me.—Come near—that boy—(what a [250]   question for a parent!)—does he survive?
Tyke. I don't know.
Lord Avon. Not know?
Tyke. No.
Lord Avon. Where did you leave him?
Tyke. Where did I leave him? Why—Come, come, talk of something else. (Seems disturbed.)
Lord Avon. Impossible!—Have you to human being ever told from whom you received that child?
Tyke. No.
Lord Avon. Then my secret's safe.
Tyke. I've said so.
Lord Avon. Why that frown? What! not even to your father?
Tyke. Who! (Starts.)
Lord Avon. What agitates you?—You had a father.
Tyke. Had a father! be quiet, be quiet. (Walks about greatly agitated.)

[Page 42]
Lord Avon. By the name of him who indignantly looks down on us, tell me—
Tyke. Say no more about that, and you shall hear all.—Yes, I had a father; and when he heard of my disgrace, the old man walked, we' heavy heart I warrant, all the way tid' [275]   jail to see me; and he prayed up to heaven for me— (Pointing, but not daring to look up) —just the same as if I had still been the pride of his heart like. (Speaks with difficulty, and sighs heavily.)
Lord Avon. Proceed.
Tyke. Presently.
Lord Avon. Did you entrust the child to his care?
Tyke. I did.
Lord Avon. Do not pause—you rack me.
Tyke. Rack you!—well, you shall hear the end out.—I meant to tell father all about the child; but, when parting came, old man could not speak, and I could not speak:—well, they put me on board a ship, and I saw father kneeling on the shore with the child in his arms.—
Lord Avon. Go on.
Tyke. 'Tis soon said— (Collecting his fortitude) — When the signal gun for sailing was fired, I saw my old father drop down dead—and somebody took up child and carried it away. I felt a kind of dizziness; my eyes flashed fire, the blood gushed out of my mouth—I saw no more.— (Sinks exhausted into a chair.)
Lord Avon. Horrible!—What! record a father's death without a tear?
Tyke. Tear! Do you think a villain who has a father's death to answer for can cry?—No, no, I [300]   feel a pack of dogs worrying my heart, and my eyes on fire—but I can't cry.— (A vacant stare of horror.)
Lord Avon. And is this desolation my work? Oh repent, repent!

[Page 43]
Tyke. For what? is not father dead?—a'n't I a thief—cursed—hated—hunted?— Why should I be afraid of the devil? don't I feel him here? My mouth's parched—
Lord Avon. Within is wine.
Tyke. Brandy, brandy!
Lord Avon. Compose yourself—follow me—you want sleep.
Tyke. Sleep, ha, ha! under the sod I may. (Points down and groans heavily.)
                                         [Exit, following Lord Avondale.

ACT III. SCENE I. —A Garden belonging to Mr. Ferment . Enter Mrs. Ferment and Julia . Mrs. Ferment. Look , my dear! the windows of Mrs. St. Clair's apartment are open, probably we may see her. “Pray, where did you first meet this interesting woman?”
Julia. “In the confines of Portugal: she had been for many years the inhabitant of a convent; but, by the fate of war, its institution was dissolved, and its members cast upon the charity of the world: we found her in obscurity and indigence, yet possessing jewels and other articles of value, which no aggravation of distress could induce her to part from. She said they were evidences by which she hoped to punish perfidy, and assert the innocence of a departed friend.”
Mrs. Fer. “A departed friend!—ah! her griefs cling so closely to her aching breast, they surely must be her own.”
Julia. “My father afforded her his protection; and I trust, madam, that under your hospitable roof she will again recover health and tranquillity.”
Julia. Here comes her attendant—an Irish girl. (Enter Shelah .) Well, good Shelah, how is my friend?
Shelah. Oh! mighty weak, madam.

[Page 45]
Mrs. Fer. I fear her indisposition increases.
Shelah. [25]   Then Heaven keep her as she is, poor lady! for fear she grows worse.—She wishes to take a walk out, so I am going to carry a coach to her.
Mrs. Fer. I'll take care of that.—Did you reside in the same convent with your Lady?
Shelah. I did, Madam, till the soldiers came with their bayonets and turned us all out into the wide wicked world, as merry as grigs, Madam.— (Curtseys.)
Mrs. Fer. You doubtless are acquainted with Mrs. St. Clair's story?
Shelah. I am, Madam.
Mrs. Fer. Then pray tell me—
Shelah. I won't, Madam.— (Curtseying.)
Mrs. Fer. My faithful girl, believe me, my question would not have tended to abuse the confidence placed in you.
Shelah. I hope not, Madam; for my fidelity is all in this world I can call my own, and that's my Lady's.
Mrs. Fer. Accept this as a reward for that fidelity— (Offering money.)
Shelah. Ah, Madam, and would you be after paying me for what is no trouble at all, and what I can't help?—Had I indeed betrayed my dear [50]   Lady, that would have been a mighty trouble to me, and I should have deserved every thing you could offer me. Excuse my boldness in refusing— my mistress wants me. (Curtseys, and exit.)
Julia. Here comes my friend.
Enter Mrs. St. Clair , leaning on Shelah. Mrs. Fer. Dear Madam!—
Julia. My charming friend!
Mrs. St. Clair. Pardon me, but when the mind
[Page 46]
is care-worn, kindness oppresses, and, but that the grateful heart can return the tribute of a tear, benevolence would oft destroy what it so nobly aims to cherish.
Mrs. Fer. I hope to tempt you abroad; the surrounding scenery is esteemed beautiful.
Mrs. St. Clair. Too well I know its charms— (apart.) —Surely the hand of providence has guided me to the place where first I saw a loved, but cruel, husband.—Oh heaven! should he yet live, and thy unerring finger point to his devoted head—first grant me thy justice—then let the dispensations of thy mercy pardon his offences!
Julia. “Come, come, you must talk to me—The day is inviting—the air invigorates the spirits, gives wings to the fancy—the jocund spring is chaunting her matin song, while she gaily weaves [75]   a chaplet for her mother nature; and rosy health, encircled by her band of wanton zephyrs, beckons you to the upland lawn, anxious to join you in her happy train.—Dare you refuse, when 'tis heaven's breath invites?—Come, come.—”
Enter Frederick . Julia. Good morning, Sir!—Mrs. St. Clair— (Presenting him.)
Fred. Lord Avondale, Madam, warmly solicitous that his services may contribute to your happiness, asks when he may be permitted the honour of attending you?
Mrs. St. Clair. Express my humble gratitude to his Lordship.—All times must equally suit her who has in this world but one business—one care.—
Fred. I shall say so; and if the efforts of him who addresses you, can serve you Lady, point but the road; inquiry must pursue, and zeal and
[Page 47]
diligence will do their best to supply the absence of influence or talent.
Mrs. St. Clair. Oh, Sir!—Dear girl, speak my gratitude.
Julia. He is already thanked: for the kind heart, while prompting the tongue to speak its dictates, receives in return the grateful whispers of approving virtue.
Fred. What fascinating sweetness!—but, stern [100]   duty! I obey thee.—My noble friend begs to lay at the feet of his fair bride this offering of his devotion—of his love.— (He tremblingly presents a portrait—she receives it—both remain silent.)
Mrs. Fer. Upon my honour, this offering seems a talisman—it has absolutely chained both your tongues.—Why, Sir, if an antiquary present to his society an old saucer, he makes a bit of a speech about it.—Let me see. Why, my love! is Lord Avondale so young, and so handsome?—
Julia. I don't know.— (Pettishly.)
Mrs. Fer. Well, well; I asked a civil question— ha! ha!
Fred. It was painted many years since.
Mrs. St. Clair. The portrait of the nobleman who has so kindly interested himself in my behalf?
Mrs. Fer. Yes; really a charming man, is he not? (Presenting the picture to Mrs. St. Clair.)
Mrs. St. Clair. Heaven! Oh, support me! (Faints.)
Mrs. Fer. She recovers.
Mrs. St. Clair. A sudden oppression—Where is that youth? (Grasps Frederick's hand, and speaks with difficulty) Are—you—his—son?
Fred. Alas! Madam, a poor orphan—the creature of his bounty.
Mrs. St. Clair. Has he no son?
Fred. [125]   None, Madam; his Lordship was never married.

[Page 48]
Mrs. St. Clair. I'm sick at heart; lead me in;— forgive me for ungratefully repelling your kindness —I must be alone.
Fred. May I convey to Lord Avondale the papers? — (She waves her hand refusingly.) —Shall his Lordship attend?
Mrs. St. Clair. Never! (To Shelah) 'Tis he!
Shelah. Ah!
Mrs. St. Clair. Hush!
                                         [Exeunt Mrs. St. Clair and Shelah. Fred. How changed—how mysterious—how to develope;—but is that my duty? No, no.
Julia. Dear, dear! I wish I could divert her from her solitude;—I wish—I'll tell you—I wish I could purchase for her a pretty low phaeton and two little quiet ponies, that I could drive. Sir, here is a purse; and when I consider that its contents might have lightened the heart of misery, I blush that it has so long remained here a useless burthen.—Will you execute this commission for me?
Fred. With my best skill.
Julia. I am sure your sympathising heart will convert this trouble to a pleasure.
Fred. [150]   Ah, Lady! of the cup of flattery we all wish to taste; but when it is presented by the hand of a Hebe, what fortitude can resist the sweet intoxication?— (Apart) Ah, perfidious wretch! is this pleading my noble patron's cause?—I humbly take my leave. (Bows and exit. Julia looks after him.)
Mrs. Fer. So, so!—my love, that's a gate.
Julia. Yes, I know 'tis a gate; but, at that moment, my thoughts were—
Mrs. Fer. On the other side of it—Here comes your father, and with him my dear wise husband.
Enter General Tarragan and Ferment . Mrs. Fer. My dear General, I have something
[Page 49]
very important to tell you. I don't like your daughter's intended husband; and she don't like him— and you ought to consult her happiness.
Gen. Why, don't I consult it? Zounds, Madam, won't her house be besieged by all the fashion of London? Won't she be hated by all her female friends? Will she have a moment's peace or comfort? What the devil would a woman have?
Julia. You don't love your daughter.
Gen. Better than any thing in the world, except my regiment.
Mrs. Fer. Then don't transfer her duty, where [175]   she can't serve with pleasure—unless the heart be a volunteer, mutiny and desertion will follow— consider a woman like a soldier.
Gen. I hope, Madam, you won't compare a woman to—
Mrs. Fer. Yes, Sir; to the best grenadier in your van: for, like him, she is pretty sure to conquer.
Gen. Indeed! Now, I think a woman is more like a soldier left in the rear.
Mrs. Fer. Ay: why?
Gen. Because he generally has a devilish deal of the baggage about him. Let them take that. (To Ferment.)
Fer. I say—she seems in a rare humour: suppose you speak to her now about her silence to me.
Gen. I will.
Fer. You promised, you know, to put an end to it for ever.
Gen. I'll do it in a minute for you, and make her own she's wrong.
Fer. Do, my dear cousin; now's the time.
Gen. To be sure—Madam, I am going to ask a favour.

[Page 50]
Mrs. Fer. Then, in other words, General, you are going to procure me a gratification.
Gen. You hear.—Madam, we [200]   have all our little foibles.
Mrs. Fer. If you allude to mine, pray call them faults.—Come! what are they? and how may I correct them?
Gen. I told you how easy it was!
Fer. Thank you!—thank you!—Now for it!
Gen. Why, then, Madam, my cousin complains of a certain reserve—you understand—a glum kind of a silence; and when I consider that man is—a man, why, I won, I am at a loss for your reasons, and wait to hear them.—Now mind her answer. (To Ferment.) —And, as I said before, wait to hear them.— (Pause—he confused.) —You know we can argue the matter pleasantly.— (Pause—he more confounded.) —Because want of temper, in such a case, is—Eh!— (Pause—he becomes irritated.) —Upon my soul, Madam, I must say— (She holds up her hands to stop him) —well, Madam—very well—I've done; and now let's hear— (She takes Julia's hand and courtseys.—They exeunt.)
Fer. Well, you've settled it!
Gen. Eh? (abashed.)
Fer. You've done it!
Gen. Yes, yes; you see she had not a word to say for herself.
Fer. No, but you forgot to make her own she [225]   was wrong.
Gen. But silence gives consent, you know.
Fer. 'Tis very pleasant!—Is not it?
Gen. Oh, 'tis the devil!—Curse it! 'tis as bad as fighting without a drum.
Fer. I'll forget her.
Gen. That's right!—And now we'll go to Lord Avondale's, and I'll introduce you.

[Page 51]
Fer. And forget her!—But, my dear cousin, every thing depends on the manner.—Now will you do it my way?—I have a plan.—I'll instruct you as we go along—and never think of her.
Gen. No, never.—
Fer. I tell you what—poor creature!—I pity her about you!
Gen. Yes, and what's more, I pity you.
Fer. No, no!
Gen. Yes, I do pity you, upon my soul!
Fer. No, no!
Gen. But I do, though.
                                         [Exeunt. SCENE II. —An Apartment in Avondale Castle. Enter Mrs. Nicely , followed by an old Man. Mrs. Nicely. Walk in, walk in.—Are you ill?
Old Man. Feeble!—very feeble!
Mrs. Nicely. And unhappy?
Old Man. Ah, Madam!
Mrs. Nicely. Come, come; tell me who you are, and all about it.
Old Man. I was a tenant of Lord Avondale's father.
Mrs. Nicely. “I don't remember you; but that's no wonder—my memory is bad.”
Old Man. “Alas! mine, too, is cruelly treacherous; for sometimes, Madam, I foolishly stand knocking at my door, forgetting that I have neither wife nor child to open it. And then, at meals, I often help them; and when I find they are not there, you may suppose I cannot eat.” (Weeps.)
Mrs. Nicely. “Your wife, then, is dead?”
Old Man. “Many years since; but she left me a son!”
Mrs. Nicely. Well, that was a comfort!

[Page 52]
Old Man. Ah, no! a profligate son, who put thorns into my pillow, and wore furrows in my cheeks! I neither expected nor hoped to survive his shame, but Heaven willed it otherwise. I employed [25]   a gentleman of the law, who always falsely flattered me he would obtain a remission of the sentence my boy was condemned to suffer. The expences I have, for years, vainly endeavoured to pay, and now a prison opens to receive these aged limbs.—But it matters not much where they lie!
Mrs. Nicely. But it does matter a great deal, though.—To shelter age and infirmity is a sacred duty, and woe be to them who neglect it!
Old Man. Having heard that Lord Avondale has returned to this country, I have walked here, in the hope he will pity an old man's sorrows.— Here is a paper, which will explain.
Mrs. Nicely. He shall have it.—Go into my room, and take something to refresh you, and come again to-morrow.
Old Man. I'm very troublesome.
Mrs. Nicely. Nonsense!—troublesome, indeed! —come very often, I shall always be very glad to see you, when it is not dirty.—Troublesome, indeed!
                                         [Exeunt Old Man and Mrs. Nicely. Enter Lord Avondale . Lord Avon. Within, there! (Enter Peter .) Find Frederick, and send him to me.
Peter. Yes, my Lord.—General Tarragan waits.
Lord Avon. Introduce him.
Peter. [50]   And Mr. Ferment.
Lord Avon. Who?

[Page 53]
Peter. The General is accompanied by Mr. Ferment, your Lordship's neighbour.
Lord Avon. Ferment!—ah, I recollect that gentleman's honourable intentions, and shall, of course, reward them.—Well, show them in here.
                                         [Exit. Enter General Tarragan and Ferment . Peter. Gentlemen, his Lordship will wait on you immediately.
Fer. You mentioned my name?
Peter. Mr. Ferment.
Fer. That's right; you're a fine fellow! (Exit Peter.) Now, my dear General, are you perfect?
Gen. Yes, yes!
Fer. But consider, 'tis the most important event!—an epoch!—a crisis!—the very acme—
Gen. Well, I'll introduce you in your own words.
Fer. But do say them again—‘My Lord, give me leave’—now do indulge me—I'm his Lordship —now begin—‘My Lord, give—’
Gen. Well, well, be quiet.—‘My Lord, give me leave to present you this—’
Fer. Bravo!
Gen. Bravo!—I thought it was gentleman!
Fer. [75]   To be sure!
Gen. Then don't put me out—‘this gentleman, whose wishes, hopes, and ambition, centre in a zeal for your Lordship's service.’
Fer. Vastly well!—Now—‘I doubt not, General, but his talents and virtues will command my esteem.’—That he'll say of course.
Gen. You think so.
Fer. Think so!—don't I know?—You only mind what you have to say yourself.—‘Command my esteem.’—Now—
Gen. Be quiet!—‘To accomplish that darling object will be the sole aim of his life.’

[Page 54]
Fer. Very well!—“Then I receive him as my friend.”
Gen. “In doing that, my Lord, you will confer on me an everlasting obligation.”
Fer. Oh, thank you, my dear cousin!— (embracing) —Then I pour forth such a torrent of eloquence— the awful moment's at hand!—he comes!—I'm all agitation! hope— (Enter Lord Avondale .) (Prompting General) My Lord, give me leave—
Gen. Damn it, be quiet!—My Lord, give me leave to present this—
Fer. Beautiful!
Gen. [100]   Beautiful gentleman!—no—this gentleman —don't put me out—whose wishes, hopes, and ambition, centre only in a zeal for your Lordship's service.— (The General only attending to what he is to say next.) —
Lord Avon. I already know the object of his zeal; it is to insinuate himself into my confidence, most honourably to worm into my secrets.
Gen. To accomplish that darling object will be the sole aim of his life.
Lord Avon. Indeed! Then, General, with your permission, I shall order a servant to show him the door.
Gen. In doing that, my Lord, you will confer on me an everlasting obligation.                                          [Exit Lord Avondale. (Ferment in agonies.) Perfect to a letter!—there, I've done for you!
Fer. Yes, you've done for me!
Gen. Well, I seldom praise myself; but if that was not what it ought to be—What! is his Lordship gone?
Fer. Gone!—Zounds! did not you hear what he said?

[Page 55]
Gen. No, not I; you told me not to mind.— What, wrong again? eh, Ferment!
Fer. Blockhead! to trust to such an old—If you [125]   know as little about war— (Walks about irritated.)
Gen. What's that you say? (Following him.)
Fer. Sir, I'll say what I please.—I'm roused, and would advise you to be careful.
Gen. Oh, I can take a hint!
Fer. What! do you talk to me of hints?—any thing to say to me—speak out like a man.
Gen. Will you fight?
Fer. No, Sir, I won't!—Damn it, I'll show a proper spirit here.
Gen. Do you see this cane?
Fer. That for your cane. (Snapping his fingers.) Don't think you have one of those to deal with who, because they have not manly fortitude enough to bear a few knocks, run into Hyde Park—load pistols—fire in the air—shake hands.—Pretty courage! —No, no!
Gen. Sir, I ask your pardon.
Fer. Sir, I'm satisfied. (Grasping his hand.)
Gen. But, zounds!—
Fer. Sir, I won't hear another word!—You have asked my pardon—pity nobody hears—you have asked my pardon, and there's an end.—Do you suppose I want you to go on your knees?
Enter Peter , who whispers General. Gen. Immediately!—Oh, very well!
Fer. [150]   Duelling, indeed!—'Pshaw.
Gen. Why, true;—'tis but poor, shabby work— a mere snack: but in glorious war—damme! there's cut and come again!—Good bye, Ferment. —I say, ‘My Lord, give me leave’—Oh, you're a beautiful gentleman!—Ha! ha!
                                         [Exit Gen. Fer. Oh, I could cry!— (sits down) —Pretty figure
[Page 56]
I shall make when I go home! (Peter bows) What's the matter with you? What are you bobbing your head at me for—Eh?
Peter. I wait your commands, Sir.
Fer. I've no commands for you, my honest fellow!
Peter. Yes, Sir, you certainly have. (Bows, and points to the door.)
Fer. Have I?— (rises) —Your name's Thomas?
Peter. No, Sir, Peter.
Fer. Ah, Peter! you never come to see my Timothy, Peter!
Peter. No, Sir, I never intrude. (Pointing to the door.)
Fer. Don't you, Peter!
Peter. A pleasant walk to you! (Pointing.)
Fer. Thank you, Peter.—Lived long here?
Peter. Yes, Sir, and hope to live here much longer.
Fer. I don't wonder at it, Peter.
Peter. A good morning, Sir.
Fer. [175]   A last look!—Oh!—
                                         [Exeunt. Enter Lord Avondale and General Tarragan . Lord Avon. Not see me?
Gen. No, my Lord.
Lord Avon. Not trust the papers and evidences in my possession?
Gen. No.—I don't understand it.
Lord Avon. What do they contain?
Gen. Why, as she tells me, certificates of marriage and baptism, letters, jewels—in short, as complete a chain of evidence as justice could desire.
Lord Avon. I rejoice to hear it.—Distraction!— Where are these papers?

[Page 57]
Gen. I can't say.—I suppose in Ferment's custody.
Lord Avon. Ah!—Within, there! (Enter Peter.) Run, directly, and tell that gentleman to return.                                          [Exit Peter. General, I'll follow you. I fear I was rather harsh to your friend.
Gen. Why, he's harmless: and, if he did not pretend to see twice as far as other folks, he might have credit for seeing half as far.—Ha!—Ha!—A mere blank cartridge, my Lord; makes a bit of a bounce and a splutter, and ends in smoke.
                                         [Exit. Enter Ferment , abashed. Lord Avon. Sir, I ask pardon for giving you the trouble of returning.
Fer. Oh! no trouble, my Lord: I had only got [200]   to the other side of the door.
Lord Avon. Give me your hand, Sir.
Fer. Oh, my Lord!
Lord Avon. Grant me your pardon, and allow me a place in your esteem.
Fer. My Lord, you—you overpower me.
Lord Avon. The fatigue of business, the many cares that press on me, teaze and—
Fer. To be sure—I know—papers to read—all those drawers full, I dare say.—Oh, I wish I was up to the elbows among them!
Lord Avon. I understand, Sir, Mrs. St. Clair has intrusted to you certain documents.
Fer. In my house, my Lord, but not in my custody. —And leave me alone to expose to the whole world the villain who has basely deserted his wife and child.
Lord Avon. Rascal! (Apart.)
Fer. Oh, I'm getting on here surprisingly!
                                         (Apart.)
[Page 58]
Lord Avon. I must know where they are concealed—I never had the pleasure of seeing your villa—if a visit would not be deemed impertinent—
Fer. Impertinent!—My dear Lord, the honour would be such an honour that—I'll go and prepare. (Going.)
Lord Avon. No, no, we must not part so.—You [225]   must dine with me.
Fer. Dine!—My boy, you have done it! (Exultingly.)
Lord Avon. Go to Mr. Ferment's —say he dines with me.
Fer. Yes, say I dine with his Lordship; and they must do without me, as well as they can. And tell my wife, if she has any thing to say—why, she must wait till I come home.
Lord Avon. Come, Sir. (Offering his hand.)
Fer. Oh, my Lord!—Peter, you see how it is.
                                         [Exeunt. SCENE III. —Inside of a Cottage—Table, and Candle burning on it.—Old Man seated, his Handkerchief to his Eyes.—Two Bailiffs standing near him. Bail. Come, come, Sir, we shall be late.
Old Man. I am ready. But your employer might have given me a little more time. I had presented a petition to a nobleman, and, perhaps, in a day or two—Well, well, now to a prison. —'Tis hard!
Bail. Why, master, our business, at best, is not a very pleasant one; but if we had to answer for those we deal with, none but a devil would be a bailiff.
Old Man. Reach me my hat, and let me take
[Page 59]
something to comfort me. (Opens a drawer, and takes out a book.)
Bail. Aye, we'll take a drop of that with you —What! a book?
Old Man. Yes, of devotion! And had your employer tasted of its spirit, he would have turned the cup of bitterness from the lips of the afflicted.
Bail. Why, that may be; but remember, old gentleman, that for one unfeeling creditor, we get hold of a hundred hard-hearted debtors, who, to have twenty dishes on their own table, will prevent twenty honest men from having one upon theirs.
Old Man. Aye, that's true!—that's very true!— [25]   It grows late—I cannot walk very fast.
Bail. Then the sooner we set out the better.
Old Man. I'll do my best.
Bail. Come, we'll help you.
Fred. (Turning round.) Hollo!
Bail. Come in.
(Enter Frederick .) Fred. Good people, I have mistaken my way. Pray inform me which road leads to the castle?
Bail. Why, if you mean York castle, we can show you, for we are going there.
Fred. To a prison!—Are you, Sir, in the custody of these men?
Old Man. Alas!
Fred. Good Heaven!
Bail. Why, is it so very singular that an old man, past work, should be behindhand in the world?
Fred. No, but I hope 'tis singular that he should suffer for it.—To prison, but not to-night. (Bailiff shakes his head.) Defer his fate but till the morning —on my word, I'll return.
Bail. Young gentleman, we must do our duty,
[Page 60]
and words won't do.—If you choose to pay fifty pounds, indeed—
Fred. Alas! I have not—ah, this purse!—for [50]   what was it intended?—to allow a lady to breathe the air more commodiously—if applied here it may prevent age and infirmity from perishing in a dungeon's noxious vapour:—'tis not mine; but will not Julia thank me? and will not my industry soon supply it?—How have you incurred this debt?
Old Man. In endeavouring to restore a lost son to his fond father's arms.
Fred. Ah, in the sacred cause of paternal love! —here, take the money! and with it take the thanks of him whose cheek was ne'er bedew'd by a father's precious tear.— (Weeps.) —Come, your demand?
Bail. Nay, your honour! we do but obey orders; but if the gentleman can pay, why, Lawyer Claw desired us to be quite civil;—and so as there's plenty of money—why, another time— (Frederick gives money.) —Thank you, Sir.—Good night, old gentleman; and I hope, for your sake, that we may never meet again.
                                         [Exit Bailiffs. Old Man. Surely this was sent by an angel!
Fred. It was, indeed!—An angel who will smile on her minister, when, to her pitying ear, he tells thy story.
Tyke. [75]   Aye, a comely kind of lad.
Bail. (Without.) Why, there's such a one in that cottage.
Enter Tyke , running. Tyke. Aye, there he is, sure enough!—I say, young fellow, run off 'tid castle as fast as you can. —His Lordship's quite in a taking—all the servants after you.

[Page 61]
Fred. Which road?
Tyke. To the right.—Come, be sharp!—be sharp!
Fred. Farewel! (taking old man's hand) ; and doubt not but Heaven has in store a blessing to reward thy virtues!—Come, come, be of good cheer. —I'll see you soon again.
                                         [Exit. Old Man. Pray, Sir, who is that generous youth?
Tyke. Why, he's a kind of foreman like, to Lord Avondale—my friend.
Old Man. Are you the friend of that worthy nobleman?
Tyke. Yes—between ourselves—I have him under my thumb;—but I say that out of confidence— you understand.—That's a smartish purse you've got there; but, I tell you what, I don't think it's very safe, just now.
Old Man. Indeed, Sir!—You alarm me!
Tyke. [100]   I tell you what—I'll take care of this for you. (Takes the purse.)
Old Man. Well, Sir, you are very kind.—You live at the castle?
Tyke. Yes, yes!
Old Man. Then, perhaps, you could aid a petition I have presented to his Lordship—my name is—
Tyke. Well, well, let's hear your name.
Old Man. Robert Tyke!
Tyke. Eh!—what!—speak!—no, don't!
Old Man. Robert Tyke!
Tyke. (Trembling violently, rushes to the table, brings down the candle, looks at the old man, dashes candle and purse on the ground, and tears his hair in agony.) Oh, villain!—villain!
Old Man. What's the matter?
Tyke. Don't you know me?
Old Man. No, Sir.

[Page 62]
Tyke. I'm glad on't!—I'm glad on't!—Ruin my own father!
Old Man. Ah! did I hear rightly?—Father!— What!—Oh! let me see—let me see! (Tyke, with a countenance strongly impressed with shame and horror, turns round.) Ah! it is my son!—my long lost, dear, profligate, boy! Heaven be thanked!— Heaven be thanked!
Tyke. Oh! burst, burst, and ease me! Eh!—but he's alive—father's [125]   alive!—Ha, ha! (laughs hysterically.)
Old Man. You terrify me. Robert, Robert, hear me!—Take my forgiveness—take my blessing!
Tyke. What!—forgive—bless—such a rogue as— (bursts into a flood of tears.)
Old Man. Be composed.
Tyke. Let me cry; it does me good, father—it does me good.
Old Man. Oh! if there be holy water, it surely is the sinner's tears.
Tyke. But he's alive! (rushes into his arms.)
Old Man. Aye! alive to comfort and pardon thee, my poor prodigal—and Heaven will pardon thee!
Tyke. No, don't say that, father, because it can't.
Old Man. It is all-merciful.
Tyke. Yes, I know it is. I know it would if it could—but not me!—No, no!
Old Man. Kneel down, and ask its mercy.
Tyke. I dare—father—I dare not!—Oh, if I durst but just thank it for thy life!
Old Man. Angels will sing for joy.
Tyke. What, may I, think you?—May I—may I? (By degrees he tremblingly falls on his knees, and clasps his hands in energetic devotion.—The curtain falls.)

ACT IV. SCENE I. —Enter Ferment , followed by Timothy . Ferment. What does your mistress say?
Tim. Why I suppose she'll obey your commands, Sir.
Fer. Yes, I know—she said she would come directly.
Tim. No, not quite, Sir.
Fer. What did she say?
Tim. Why she said plump she would not.
Fer. Confusion!
Tim. Yes; there's plenty of that in this house.
Fer. But, yet, I'll condescend to introduce her to Avondale Castle. Yes, yes, I'll take her under my wing, poor woman!—Timothy, go and prepare the sociable.
Tim. The sociable!—for whom, Sir?
Fer. For my wife and myself.
Tim. What! together in a sociable! Why that's so comfortable! Ecod! it shall be ready in a minute.
                                         [Exit. Fer. But 'tis devilish hard to come home in triumph, overflowing with exultation, and no one to partake in my joy—not a word of congratulation— (Enter Shelah .) How do you do? how do you do?
Shelah. Oh! thank you, Sir—I hope your honour is well.
Fer. [25]   Now, she'll talk to me!—What, you've been pulling a poesy—

[Page 64]
Shelah. For my dear mistress, Sir. But, oh! she's unhappy; and in that case, as I have read in an Irish poetry book,—the perfume of flowers will not please the eye—the peaceful silence of evening does not charm the ear—nor heavenly dreams refresh the mind, which cannot take repose.
Fer. Pray, my dear, did you meet my wife?
Shelah. No, Sir.—Oh, what a happy man you are!—
Fer. Am I?
Shelah. To have a wife so handsome, and such a sweet-spoken lady.
Fer. Is she?
Shelah. Oh! to hear her talk is delightful!—
Fer. Delightful, is it?—Indeed!—Now would not this drive a man mad? (Throws himself into a chair.)
Shelah. Any thing the matter?—Are you ill, Sir? Can I offer any consolation?
Fer. Eh! what? Can you offer consolation?— (Jumps up.) —Egad I've hit it!—Suppose I try to make my wife jealous?—'Tis a brilliant thought, and here's a very pretty subject!—If that won't untie her tongue, the devil's in't.—'Tis a monstrous fine [50]   thought!—What shall I say, tho'?—I—I—you—you —we—we—eh!
Shelah. What's the matter? Are you dying?
Fer. I am—with love for you, my darling!
Shelah. (Runs and closes the cabinet.) Sir!
Fer. You are a divine creature, and I am a man of honour and secrecy. Don't be terrified, my little trembler!
Shelah. And is it yourself would take advantage of a poor weak girl? (She pushes him from her with great force: he falls into a chair.) Oh! oh! (She weeps.)
Fer. Zounds! (recovering) don't weep, my angel: behold me at your feet!
Shelah. And is it that you want your throat cut
[Page 65]
by my little brother Samson, that you dare insult? Rise, Sir! (Jerks him up violently.)
Fer. Zounds! no!— (rubbing his shoulder.) Hush! Damn it, 'tis all a fetch. 'Tis only to make my wife jealous!—Don't howl so.—I'll explain.— I wish to take advantage of your weakness! (rubbing his shoulder.) Oh Lord! not I.—Here comes my wife. —Now, do humour the thought, that's a good soul! and, if I should offer to kiss you, now don't knock me down, that's a dear little girl! (He gallants in dumb show.)
Enter Mrs. Ferment . Mrs. Fer. Heavens! what do I see?—Sir!
Fer. [75]   Madam!
Mrs. Fer. Am I thus insulted?—
Fer. Silence!—
Mrs. Fer. Sir, I shall not be silent; and I say—
Fer. I know what you would say—you would say your love is wounded—but I say I don't care that for your love.—
Mrs. F. This usage—
Fer. Is not to be borne, you say; but I say, you must bear much more.
Mrs. F. What! won't you hear me?
Fer. No, Ma'am. You are always chattering; and you know I despise the paltry prattle of the sex, so let me have mute obedience.—
Mrs. F. Inhuman! was ever woman so insulted?
Fer. Charming!
Mrs. F. I, that have made your real happiness the study of my life—
Fer. Delightful!
Mrs. F. I, that have had that confidence in your love, that nothing but the evidence of my senses— Cruel man! have I deserved this?—oh!— (Weeps.)
Fer. It will do, it will do!

[Page 66]
Mrs. F. (Overhears him; turns to Shelah, who explains in dumb show, and exit.) Is it so?
Fer. Well, I hope you have done with your silly [100]   idle complainings? (Pause.) —Hold your tongue, Madam! (Pause.) —Why don't you hold your tongue? (Pause.) —Not but what I would condescend to hear what you complain of—justice demands that—but don't be tedious. (Pause.) —Damme but she's dumb again!—Dry your tears, my darling Fanny, and I'll convince you that my love is still—
Mrs. F. Ha, ha, ha!
Fer. What do you laugh at, Madam? I'll give you a hundred pounds to tell me what you laugh at. I'll—I've done with you: and if ever I open these lips to you again, may all the—
Mrs. F. George!
Fer. Oh! that voice—how it soothes!—my love!
Mrs. F. Go!
Fer. Go! go where? what do you mean by go? (Pause.) —Yes, I will go to the world's end. (Going, returns.) —No, I won't go. (Sits down.) —And now I should like to hear what you can say. (She retires.) —What, then, you'll go?—very well, Madam!— good bye to you!—won't you say good bye? (Exit Mrs. Ferment.) —Won't you say—you won't say good bye? (Bawling after her.) —Furies! Devils! Let discord reign for ever! Oh!—
Enter Timothy . Tim. The sociable's ready, Sir.
Fer. [125]   Stand out of my way, you rascal! or I'll—
                                         [Exit, driving off Timothy. SCENE II. —The Pavilion. Enter Shelah with caution: she looks about. Shelah. Madam, you may approach; there is no one here.

[Page 67]
Enter Mrs. St. Clair . Mrs. St. Clair. Ah! do I again behold the place which gave me birth; where I fondly gamboled round my parents' knees?—Oh! could their kind hearts have known the sorrows their child was doomed to suffer!—Alas! how changed! For the lowly cottage, I see the gaudy palace! 'Stead of the modest woodbine, tangling its ligaments in the humble thatch, and giving sweetness to the breath of nature—behold the proud exotic, in sullen majesty shedding its feverish perfume!—just emblem of its imperious master!—
Shelah. Imperious! Give him his true title—a villain.
Mrs. St. Clair. No, no.
Shelah. What! is he not going to be married again?—
Mrs. St. Clair. Nay,—you know he thinks me dead.—Ah! what do I see?—that cabinet!—it was mine—it contained—Are we observed?
Shelah. No, dear lady.
Mrs. St. Clair. If I am right, the secret spring will unfold— (touching it, the doors open, and discovers a portrait of Mrs. St. Clair in a Spanish habit, her right hand pointing to the ring on her left.)
Shelah. [25]   Sure, and 'tis your own sweet self!—and in the dress you have with such care preserved!
Mrs. St. Clair. Yes; the better to conceal our marriage, I assumed the dress of the country.—Oh, memory! thou torturer of the wretched! why dost thou whisper to this aching heart,—that I was then a happy mother and a wife? Now—yet some consolation steals into my breast—perhaps he has raised this to my memory—perhaps he sometimes sits here alone, and to my wrongs pays the tribute of a repenting tear:—but then my little cherub—my darling boy—torn from my breast—
[Page 68]
abandoned—lost!—can a mother pardon that?—no, never, never.—Yet I'll save him from a further crime!—but how?—Ah, that dress!—it shall be so! —Yes: at an awful moment he shall again behold an injured wife—shall hear a mother's moans—then see me leave him, and the world, for ever.
Shelah. Oh, then, dear lady, take me with you!
Mrs. St. Clair. Ah! we're surprised!—I hear footsteps—
Shelah. (Runs and closes the cabinet.) Don't be alarmed. This way—this way.
                                         [Exeunt. Enter Lord Avondale , followed by Mrs. Nicely , bearing a small box. Lord Avon. Set it down. I hope the weight has not fatigued you?
Mrs. Nicely. [50]   No, no, 'tis not heavy; and when the heart's light the body's nimble, be it ever so old—ha, ha!
Lord Avon. I am glad to see you so merry.
Mrs. Nicely. Ah! a clean house and a clean conscience will make any one merry.
Lord Avon. Heigh-ho!—I have not forgot the petition.
Mrs. Nicely. Oh, my Lord, 'tis all settled.—Mr. Frederick, Heaven bless him! saved the old man— he has gained the love of every body.
Lord Avon. I rejoice to hear it.—
Mrs. Nicely. Indeed!—but I fancy you won't be glad to hear that he has gained the love of one who—
Lord Avon. What mean you?
Mrs. Nicely. Why, if I know what eyes say, Miss Julia and he—
Lord Avon. Ah!
Mrs. Nicely. They just look as you and poor Emily used to do.—

[Page 69]
Lord Avon. Oh, spare me! spare me! (a knocking at the door.) —See who is there. (Mrs. Nicely goes out and returns.)
Mrs. Nicely. 'Tis the young man who comes here by your appointment.
                                         [Exit. Lord Avon. Shew him in.—'Tis plain I am suspected! [75]   —And shall the name of Avondale become the sport of foes—the jest of fools?—No, no!—It is determined!—These evidences of my shame must, shall be mine!—Now to my purpose! (He unlocks the box and takes out a cloak, a mask, and pistol. On hearing some one approach, he covers the pistol with the cloak.) —This fellow will be a fit instrument to effect it. (Enter Tyke .) (Beckons Tyke to approach—turning round is surprised at his appearance, which is changed to a plain but very neat dress) —Astonishing! can this be the man?
Tyke. No, it is not;—I be quite another man to day—ha! ha!
Lord Avon. Why do you laugh?
Tyke. Why I laugh, my Lord, because I've been crying. Ha! ha! I say, I've found old man—father's alive—he! he! and, do you know, he says positive sure Heaven will forgive me; and I declare, I somehow feel so warm and comfortable, that, between you and me, I should not at all wonder, if it had already.
Lord Avon. You thought your father dead?
Tyke. Yes, and he thought so himself, poor man! but it was really what you gentry call a fine—a finenomenoun—You understand, that the ironmonger who made tackle for our legs picked father up, got life into him again, and took him up to Lunnon, and just advertised in News the antedote about his
[Page 70]
case; and, would you believe it! next morning fine ladies in their own coaches came tid' old man, we' [100]   tears in their pratty eyes, and bank-notes in their pratty hands to a matter of forty pound—Now I've just one commentation to mak on this matter:— I've seen your player show folks, and such-like wiggeling and waggeling, and chattering about London pride, and London profligation, and what not— Now I think, if one of them was just to set about talking a little of London kindheartedness and London charity, it would be rather more truerer, and quite as becoming.
Lord Avon. Tell me, knows he aught of that boy?
Tyke. What! your son?—no, never could hear a word about him—Ah! could we but make him out now, then mayhap your Lordship would try your hand at a bit of a laugh:—let me only once see him—I'll find him out directly.
Lord Avon. Ah!
Tyke. That is, if I know 'tis him—you understand.
Lord Avon. Pshaw!
Tyke. Because I put a mark upon him.
Lord Avon. Indeed!
Tyke. Oh yes, I managed it right enough.
Lord Avon. Explain.
Tyke. Why, you know, before you were a Lord, [125]   your name was Mr. Philip; so I got some gunpowder and marked an F on his neck, because F stands for Philip—yes yes—it struck me as proper.
Lord Avon. Come hither, Robert—I sent for you to— (looks at the cloak) —to tell you—that—that you possess my regard—
Tyke. Thank you, my Lord.
Lord Avon. And may command my patronage and protection.
Tyke. And you mine—quite mutual, I assure you.

[Page 71]
Lord Avon. You can confer on me happiness.
Tyke. Why no, sure.
Lord Avon. By putting me in possession of certain evidences, you can save me from ruin.
Tyke. What! can I tho'?—I'll go through water or fire, or any thing—Come, let's begin—How—where?
Lord Avon. Look under that cloak—it will explain the means.
Tyke. I will—he! he!—I declare I'm as happy as — (lifts up the cloak, sees pistol and mask, then trembling drops the cloak.)
Lord Avon. You know the use of those?
Tyke. I do.
Lord Avon. You must employ them.
Tyke. Hush! (still trembling.)
Lord Avon. [150]   What alarms you?
Tyke. Hush!
Lord Avon. No one hears?
Tyke. Yes, there does.
Lord Avon. Impossible!
Tyke. There does, I tell you—there does.
Lord Avon. Ah! how! where?— (Tyke, shuddering, points up to heaven) —Damnation!—baffled—trod on by this wretch!—and must I stoop to dissemble? —Robert, I am satisfied.
Tyke. I wish I was.
Lord Avon. 'Twas but to try your virtue.
Tyke. Was not it, tho'?—well, I hope that's true; but it flustered me sadly—I declare, I'm all of a dother now.
Lord Avon. But, swear to me—
Tyke. No, I'll never swear no more.
Lord Avon. True, 'tis unnecessary—Here, take this purse, good fellow.
Tyke. Eh! no, no.
Lord Avon. For the friendship I bear you.

[Page 72]
Tyke. Yes, I understand; only, you see—you'll excuse me.
Lord Avon. Do you scorn my bounty?
Tyke. By no means, only it won't do—no more [175]   purses.
Lord Avon. For your father's sake—
Tyke. Yes, yes, I'm sensible about all that—but as to father, you see, I happen to have a couple of hands at his service—I'm much obliged—only I've grown a little cute and knowing lately.
Lord Avon. And would I again plunge his soul in guilt!—Oh! villain, villain!
Tyke. Did you speak to me?—Oh—talking of yourself—yes, yes—Why, I'll tell you a bit of secret, my Lord: I've found out that the honestest are the cunningest chaps—Why, there is father now—he's a deep one—do you know, he can lay his head on his pillow, and think of dying we' a smile—I say he mun have kept a pratty sharp look out as to what's right like—must not he?
Lord Avon. Leave me.
Tyke. I will—I say, my Lord, he! he! I is going tid' plough this afternoon, to earn a supper for old man—ha, ha!— (snapping his fingers) —Do your Lordship's heart good to come and see I work— (rubbing his hands exultingly.)
Lord Avon. Leave me, I say!
Tyke. We' pleasure—Ah! I see how it is—Excuse the liberty I take we' your poor soul—but if you would but be persuaded to fall a crying, and [200]   be comfortable—
Lord Avon. Instantly begone!
Tyke. I will.—Shall I send old man to you?—Oh, he's a capital hand at your deplorable case.—
                                         [Exit. Tyke (without.) Yes, yes; you'll find his Lordship in that room.

[Page 73]
Enter Frederick . Lord Avon. Ah, Frederick, speak—ease this agonized breast! this tortured brain!—what hast thou heard?
Fred. All access to the lady, or the evidence she possesses, is impossible.
Lord Avon. Be it so. Frederick—I love—I envy —I fear thee.
Fred. My dear Lord!—fear him who would sacrifice his life?
Lord Avon. Thy life!—would'st thou?
Fred. Put my firmness to the proof.
Lord Avon. I shall do so.—Mark me—In early life—blest years of innocence!—I loved a sweet and virtuous girl, but lowly born—come and behold her— (opens the cabinet.) —Ill-fated Emily! oh, could I recall that guilty hour—
Fred. With what melancholy sweetness she points to the pledge of virtuous love.
Lord Avon. Yes, to avoid a parent's anger, we [225]   were privately married.—I went abroad, in the suit of an ambassador; and she imprudently followed me. She lived in profound retirement—I could seldom see her; but her regret at my absence was softened by the endearments of our infant son.
Fred. Have you a son?
Lord Avon. I had—oh, do not torture, but hear me! Shortly after the ambassador died, and I was thought worthy of the splendid appointment. From that moment ambition took full possession of my soul, and my buoyant fancy twined round my brow the proudest honours a subject can enjoy; but
[Page 74]
this secret—this degrading marriage—crushed each aspiring thought.
Fred. But, surely, the affection of a virtuous woman would compensate—
Lord Avon. That was prevented: for my wife was secretly, but falsely, accused of practices against the religion of the country.
Fred. How I envy you the proud joy of asserting her innocence, and affording her the protecting arm of the husband she loved!
Lord Avon. True; but—
Fred. Did you not so?
Lord Avon. No;—it might have injured my [250]   fortunes at home.
Fred. What!—a virtuous wife injure the fortunes of a British statesman?—You know, my Lord, it is not so; you know you libel your august patron. —Did you discover the secret villain who accused her?
Lord Avon. Villain!
Fred. Was he not a damned one?
Lord Avon. He was.—Oh, Frederick! avert that face, lest the indignant lightning of thy eye blast me!—I was that villain!
Fred. You freeze my blood!—The man that I have worshipped—that my very soul is bound to—
Lord Avon. My innocent wife was secretly immured in a convent, and the news shortly reached me—that she was no more.
Fred. It cannot be! Oh, tell me so!—My noble patron is the nurse of merit, the scourge of baseness; the good man's hope, the villain's fear; the great man's envy, and the poor man's friend.
Lord Avon. Thou tortur'st me, for such I might have been:—but now view me, in all my horrors— behold the selfish patriot, the abject hypocrite, the savage father, and the murdering husband.

[Page 75]
Fred. Oh, ambition!
Lord Avon. [275]   Aye, it was my god: for that I suffered this lovely flower to wither in a cloister's gloom; for damned ambition I tore my infant from it's mother's panting breast, and he is lost—lost for ever! But mark:—Heaven, who is as watchful to lay bare the villain's breast as it is to shelter that of innocence, has, as from the grave, raised up evidence of my shame; I know where they are concealed—they must instantly be mine.
Fred. But how?
Lord Avon. By theft.
Fred. Forbid it, Heaven!
Lord Avon. Think'st thou I would live to hear my name coupled with dishonour, or behold myself (as inquisitors treat their victims) drest out in hellish shapes, and thus exposed to public mockery and scorn?—No, no— (seizes the pistol and mask.)
Fred. Ah!
Lord Avon. Frederick, didst thou not say thou would'st sacrifice thy life?
Fred. Aye, my life, but not my honour:—to save you, pluck out this heart—but its last pulse shall throb with virtue.
Lord Avon. Thou dost refuse?
Fred. It is impossible—no wretch can be found—
Lord Avon. [300]   Yes, there is one I am sure of.
Fred. Ah, who?
Lord Avon. Avondale!—Tell me, is he not a villain fitted to my purpose? (snatches up the cloak.) Farewell! should we meet no more—and if my aim fail, it will be so—thou wilt find that in my death I have not forgot thee. (Is strongly affected.) —Pardon, good, dear youth, the trial to which I put thy virtue: —on my soul, I am glad that it sustained it. (Weeps.)
Fred. Ah, tears! obey their sacred impulse.
[Page 76]
Plunge not your soul in horrors. Thus I'll cling to you—thus save you from a damning deed. (Kneels.)
Lord Avon. Frederick, beware! (Presents the pistol to him.) —Thou art the only soul on earth I love: but thee, even thee, would I roll at my feet a corpse didst thou check my purpose.—Do not pull more murders on my head.—'Tis in vain—farewell! (Breaks from him and rushes out.)
Fred. Father of mercies, pity and pardon!— (Follows him.)

[Page 77]
ACT V. SCENE I. —An inclosed Apartment with two Doors, and a Flight of Steps as leading to a Turret. Frederick descends. Frederick. Not returned!—I've watched from the turret, which commands the road, till my strained eye-balls refuse their office.—This agony of doubt is dreadful—but must soon be changed to more awful certainty:—should he succeed, each hour of life will accumulate sorrows on his head—should he fail, then my loved, my kind benefactor, is dead.— Hark! sure, I heard a confused noise—again! — (a pistol is fired.) —O Heaven! he is no more— (A noise is made at the door, it opens, Lord Avondale rushes in, and takes off his mask.)
Fred. Ah, he lives!
Lord Avon. Behold—they're mine— (shewing casket and papers.) —
Fred. I heard the report of a pistol.
Lord Avon. It was levelled at one who pursued me. Let me but plunge these in eternal night— then fate I defy— (Ferment without) Follow, follow —this way!
Lord Avon. Ah! I'm pursued.
Fer. Hush! here we may avoid—ah! this door beset?
Lord Avon. Then escape is impossible—and, bereft of the means of death! O Frederick! if thou lovest me, take this faithless weapon, nerve thy young arm, and in mercy dash out this maddening brain.
( General Tarragan without.) [25]   We have him, sure enough.

[Page 78]
Lord Avon. Dost thou hear? Wilt thou behold me dragged forth a criminal?
Fred. Distracting thought!—how—where? Oh that my life could save you!—My life—Ah!—It shall be so.—
Lord Avon. What dost thou mean
Fred. Give me this weapon—this mask.
Lord Avon. Frederick, what would'st thou?—
Fred. (Turning round.) Save my benefactor. —I cannot sin, but I can suffer for you.
Gen. Force the door.
Lord Avon. Think me not so damned—
Fred. There is no time for words—fly to the turret.—I being found, all search will cease.
Lord Avon. Thou shalt not suffer, by Heaven!
Fred. No, no; fear not, I will escape—a moment more and all is lost: they force the door— away, away!— (Lord Avondale retreats to the turret —Frederick puts on cloak and mask—the door is forced—General Tarragan, Ferment , and a number of Servants rush in.)
Gen. Ah, there he stands!—unmask the villain.
Fer. I'll do that. (Going up to Frederick he shews the pistol—Ferment retreats—Frederick then takes of the mask.)
All. Frederick!
Gen. What!—no!—it can't be!—let me see him, only let me see him!— (wiping his eyes) —Villain, [50]   viper, hypocrite!—S'death! what am I about?—I that have lighted the mine that was to blow into the air hundreds of innocent souls—and now to snivel at a—but they are red-hot drops of fury, damme! I shall be choaked instead of him—Seize him! Where's his Lordship?
Fer. I'll find him directly.—I know I shall succeed to the situation he has dishonoured—that's all the comfort I can afford; and if he wants more, let him look for it in his own breast.
                                         [Exit. Fred. (Turning round.) I will look there.

[Page 79]
Gen. You have disgraced the charity that fostered you—your example may palsy the warm hand of benevolence, and many an innocent may suffer for your crime.
Fred. Oh!
Julia, (without.) What do I hear! I'll not believe it.
Fred. Julia's voice!—Oh, save me from this pang —lead me to my prison.
Gen. Hold!—
Enter Julia . Julia. O Frederick! then it is so—father, support me!
Gen. Look at this girl—the daughter of General Tarragan—more—the heiress to a princely fortune [75]   —nay, more—the darling child of an honest man.— I don't cry, you rascal!—now, do I?—she, yes, she confessed she loved you.
Fred. Oh, brain! brain! brain!
Gen. Recover, and hear more.—I, like a fond father —no, like a damned old rascal—was about to ask Lord Avondale's consent to your union. Now, away with him!
Fred. Hold off one moment— (he breaks from them and falls at Julia's feet) —Angel of pity, through whose cherub lips the breath of hatred never yet found way—oh, do not curse me!
Julia. Say, then, you are innocent.
Fred. I am.
Julia. Innocent?
Fred. Oh, most unfortunate.
Gen. Away with him, I say!
Fred. Stand off!—Julia mine—that heaven within my reach. Instant conduct me to—
Julia. Where?—speak, speak, Frederick— where?—
Fred. To— (after a struggle which overpowers him)
[Page 80]
—to my prison— (he falls exhausted into the attendants' arms, they bear him off.)
Gen. Zounds! I'm as hot as—I'm a portable furnace:—but where is his Lordship; you shall be [100]   his instantly: I won't eat—I won't sleep—till you are Lady Avondale.
Julia. My happiness is gone for ever.
Gen. No, it is not—you shall be happy—you shall be a happy bride.—Fly, rascals! find Lord Avondale. (Exeunt Servants.) Come along, you shall be this day a happy, happy bride.
                                         [Exeunt. SCENE III. —A Room in the Castle. Enter Lord Avondale followed by Tyke . Lord Avon. My good fellow—
Tyke. Bless me, my Lord, what can be the matter!
Lord Avon. I am distracted.
Tyke. Oh, now I understand—he's going to be married, poor man; and, of course, in a taking about it—why, that's all natural enough.
Lord Avon. Hear me—Frederick has been detected—
Tyke. Detected!
Lord Avon. In the commission of a robbery.
Tyke. What! that mask—that pistol— (shaking his head.)
Lord Avon. Hush! Dost thou not pity him?
Tyke. I do, indeed!—poor lad!—I say, you know he is not half so bad as either of us.
Lord Avon. Robert, I was once thy landlord—I trust not a severe one.
Tyke. Severe!—nay, that's cutting;—that's as much as to say that I've forgot your kindness to me.—Did not you put me to school? and though I settled all my matters there in a month, that was
[Page 81]
no fault of yours: you gave me money—if I misused it, you were not to blame: only tell me how I can show my love, honestly, we' submission like.—
Lord Avon. Procure Frederick's escape.
Tyke. [25]   I'll do my best.
Lord Avon. See this purse, 'tis richly stored; and, properly disposed of, it may do much:—promise any thing—half my estates; and remember, Robert, that in saving him you will preserve my life.
Tyke. What! your life?—that's enough.— (Takes the purse and runs off.)
Lord Avon. Never, Frederick, shall judgment be pronounced against thee.—Here I swear, that if the hour of trial come, Avondale will stand forth arrayed in all his guilt, and save that innocent, that noble, youth.
Enter Peter . Peter. General Tarragan requests your immediate attendance—he entreats the marriage ceremony may instantly take place— (Lord Avondale starts.) —The preparations have already began.
Lord Avon. I'll come to him. (Exit Peter.) Marriage—why does the thought terrify? My heart ceases to beat—my numbed limbs seem to fasten on the earth, and the faded form of Emily flits before my dazzled sight.—Let me shake off this horrid lethargy—let me collect my thoughts. (Sinks into a chair.)
Enter Mr. and Mrs. Ferment at the back Scene. Fer. There he is—he seems unhappy; but as soon as he perceives me, you'll see the difference. I suppose the evidence of your own eyes and ears will [50]   convince you? now mark the attention, the joy.—
[Page 82]
How do you do, my Lord,—how do you do? (Lord Avondale looks—then turns from him—Ferment, disappointed, carries his chair round to the other side) — I see how it is, my lord; the villany of that young viper, which you fostered in your bosom—but I flatter myself, that, in your humble servant, you will find more talent, and a zeal warm as—
Lord Avon. Did you speak?
Fer. Yes, a little.
Lord Avon. Oh! (relapsing into inattention.)
Fer. But for me, the monster would have escaped.
Lord Avon. Ah! indeed!
Fer. Oh! now we come on a little—Did not your lordship know that I detected him?—
Lord Avon. No— (restraining his rage.)
Fer. Oh! all owing to me—caught a glimpse of the villain in my house—followed him up close—he thought to frighten me. Pugh—fired at me—received his shot like a castle—it passed through my hat—not this hat—but I take no merit.
Lord Avon. Yet take—
Fer. Oh, my sweet lord!—any thing that you propose—
Lord Avon. Yes—take my everlasting curses.
                                         [Exit. Fer. [75]   Oh, lord! oh, dear! I'm very ill.—Fanny, wife—one word—only one—let me hear some voice beside my own in this damned infernal house, as poor Juliet says, or I shall faint.
Mrs. Fer. Do you confess you are wrong?
Fer. I do.
Mrs. Fer. Will you abandon your schemes?
Fer. I will.
Mrs. Fer. Will you sometimes follow my advice?
Fer. Always—you shall be my magnet.

[Page 83]
Mrs. Fer. The first that ever attracted lead, I believe—ha! ha!
Fer. Say what you will, only talk—and if ever I go a lord-hunting again, may I lose this worthless head!
Mrs. Fer. Then, if ever I think of ruling again, may I lose your estimable heart!
Fer. What—don't make me cry—then, that for you, old sour-crout (snapping his fingers.) —I have a plan!
Mrs. Fer. A plan! (alarmed.)
Fer. A plan for imitating your silence, my dear Fanny.
Mrs. Fer. Then my plan shall be to imitate your prattling—You know, after so long a silence—
Fer. [100]   You must have a great many words by you.
Mrs. Fer. I shall talk till I tire you.
Fer. No, you won't.
Mrs. Fer. Yes, I shall.
Fer. No—Oh, delicious!—charming!—
                                         [Exeunt, embracing. SCENE IV. —Inside of a Prison.— Frederick discovered; his figure and dress bespeaking the desolation of his mind. Frederick. When the contemplative mind approaches death, how little seems the mighty war of passions which agitate this atom, man! “But, how tedious are the hours—and, if to the breast of innocence a prison brings its terrors, what must his sufferings be, whose sole companions are those thoughts which haunt his guilty breast!”—O Julia!—to know thy love only to meet thy hate!—Perhaps even now he leads her to the altar—Ah! that thought is madness —but no, it cannot be—this is no hour for joy —my fate must banish pleasure from their hearts—
[Page 84]
no—no—'t is impossible. I wrong my friend—I wrong thee, lovely Julia! (A chime of bells sound at a distance.) Ah! those sounds—it is the marriage peel—and with it, my dying knell!—Julia, hear me—I am innocent!—Avondale, hold—inhuman, guilty man! (The door is unlocked.—Enter Tyke and Jailor.—Tyke motions Jailor to retire— Jailor exit.)
Tyke. There he is, poor fellow!—yet I think he looks innocent—at least I am pratty sure, when I used to look intid' glass, I never saw any thing like that— I say—I is come to comfort the like—I hope thou repents of what thou hast done?
Fred. No.
Tyke. Oh dear! he's not fit to die!—I mun get [25]   him away—I say, Lord Avondale sent me to—
Fred. Oh!—leave me!
Tyke. But I won't though—thou mun try to escape.
Fred. I will not escape.—Be gone, rascal!
Tyke. Rascal!—well, I was one, and I mun bear it—but—
Fred. Dare not approach me.
Tyke. Pugh! Pugh! (advancing.)
Fred. Must I, then, force you from my presence! (strikes him.)
Tyke. A blow!— (seizes Frederick by the collar; the action forces open the neck of his shirt, sees the F marked on his neck; he tremblingly lets go, and points to the mark.)
Fred. What do you point at?
Tyke. At—at—I hardly dare look again!—Eh! 'Tis he—'tis he! (with great animation.)
Fred. This mark!
Tyke. I made it—I'll take my oath on't. I've found him—I've found him!
Fred. Speak!
Tyke. Come to thy father's—Come to Lord Avondale!

[Page 85]
Fred. Ah!—have I then suffered in a father's cause! Oh, do not deceive me!
Tyke. Why, do I look like such a savage beast, then?—See here! (placing his hands on his moist eyes and shewing them.) Believe my eyes, if you [50]   won't my tongue. I've often danced thee on my knee!—Give me thy hand!
Enter Jailor. Jailor. What's the matter here?
Fred. My happiness—the happiness of Lord Avondale—is in your power. The property in question was my own, the legacy of an unfortunate mother. Pinion me, hand and foot, only bring me to my father!
Tyke. Do—I'll stay here for him.—No, I can't do that—I must be in the thick on't.
Fred. Be merciful—I will not fly!
Jailor. Why, I believe I may venture to take you to the castle.
Tyke. You may. I'll hold him fast round the neck—and then his father will hold him fast round the neck.
Fred. Oh! each moment is an age!
Jailor. Well—let me find the key.
Tyke. Oh, never mind key— (rushes against the door—it opens.) There—come—come.
                                         [Exeunt.
[Page 86]
SCENE the last. —A Gothic Chapel illuminated; the entrance of the choir in the back scene, with steps to ascend—folding-doors conceal the interior of the chapel—Music behind the scenes—a Marriage Procession enters—then Lord Avondale, Julia , and General Tarragan . Gen. Well, my Lord, the joyful hour has at length arrived. I fancy it would be difficult to find three happier people. (Lord Avondale bows.) Now, farewel to Julia Tarragan!—a name my tongue has dwelt on with rapture, and demands a parting tear. Kiss me, my girl!—but, I shall see thee grace a nobler name. Well, now to the altar—my Lord, we wait—
Lord Avon. For me! (Recovering) My lovely bride, your hand— (They move towards the chapel—the folding-doors are opened, which discovers Mrs. St. Clair in the dress of the picture, her right hand pointing to the wedding ring—Lord Avondale, advancing up the steps, beholds her—falls back into the arms of the attendants, exclaiming) Angels of mercy!—Emily! (Faints.)
Emily. Yes!—behold thy innocent—thy much-wronged wife!— (All express astonishment—she comes forward.) Inhuman man!—hear me!—Where is my child?—where is my darling boy?
Tyke. Stand out of the way!—here he comes!—here he comes!—
Enter Frederick and Tyke . Fred. Julia!—married!—
Julia. (Looking down.) No, Frederick!
Fred. (Turning round.) Ah! what means this?—Father, father! hear me!—It is your son that calls!—Will not that charmed name restore you?
Emily. Ah, son?— (Leans on Julia.)

[Page 87]
Fred. (Turning round.) What do I see?—that [25]   form!—that dress!—Oh, tell me!—does my heart deceive me?—Mother!— (She rushes into his arms.) I know thy wrongs—my father has bewailed them with tears of anguish. Oh, forgive him—he has been my benefactor—he has loved me—he has been a father to me—take his hand—there—the warm contact will animate each torpid pulse; will wake his heart to penitence—to love—ah, he revives—
Lord Avon. Emily! —Ah! Frederick here!—what am I to think?
Tyke. Think!—look there—look there— (pointing to the mark) —he is your own.
Lord Avon. What! my wife?—my child?—both, both restored?—O All-merciful accept my contrition —deign to receive my gratitude!— (The curtain slowly falls, while Lord Avondale, kneeling, lifts his hands to heaven—Emily leans on the shoulder of Frederick, who with one arm infolds her, while the other points with affection to Lord Avondale—Julia takes the other hand of Emily—General Tarragan rests on his stick, with his handkerchief to his eyes—Tyke, with joyful satisfaction, points to the group.)

END OF THE PLAY.

EPILOGUE. [By Litchfield, Mr.] WRITTEN BY MR. LITCHFIELD. Spoken by Mrs. Litchfield .
Well , ladies! say, what think you of my plan;
Is silence the true way to conquer man?—
At least 'tis new— talking , we've found, won't please him;—
Then follow my advice— be dumb —and teaze him.
We women (thus their cry is), old or young,
Rely on volubility of tongue;—
[Page 88]

That shrill-ton'd bell, which, morning, noon, and night,
Rings in their ears, and fills them with affright.
A bell?—poor souls! with all their fuss about it,
They little think how dull they'd be without it.
Muffle the clapper! and these changeling men
Would long to hear the 'larum strike again :—
Is it not so?—be honest, sirs, and tell us,
Without our prattle, a'n't you wretched fellows?
When we are absent, mirth and spirit fail,
And awful monosyllables prevail:—
‘How do, sir?’—‘What's o'clock?’—‘No news?’—‘Can't say’—
‘Not been on 'Change.’—‘Dem'd cold!’—‘Curs'd fog!’ ‘Good day!’
In livelier vein we regulate our chat,
And, quick as thought, we rove from this to that—
‘A fine bright morning!—let's put on our gaiters,
Visit the Serpentine, and see the skaiters;
They say 'tis vastly clever in the papers;
And Captain Twirlit cuts such charming capers!’
Then talk of politics, of manners, men,
Of chairs and sofas à l'Egyptienne ;
Our patriot volunteers—our gallant tars—
Invaders panic-struck , and Spanish wars :
Spanish ! my hearts of oak (to the Galleries) you know what follows—
Galleons tow'd into port well cramm'd with dollars.
Such are the subjects of our conversation;—
Can you improve them, lords of the creation ?
Quiet or moving, still to this (pointing to the tongue) you yield—
‘Equal to both, and arm'd for either field.’
But hold!—my husband kept me so long dumb,
That, now before this circle I am come,
‘I prattle out of fashion;’—let me say
One word about our author and his play—
But needless were the task;—your smiles will shew
All that his anxious wishes seek to know.
'Twere pity, ladies! if his play miscarried,
Who taught you all the ‘ Way to get well married .’
Oft has our poet tried to ease your smart,—
Be grateful now, and ‘ Cure his aching heart :’
Wish ‘ Speed then to his plough ’—befriend his cause—
And let him reap the harvest of applause.

[Page 1]
Main text ACT I. Scene Scene.—The Baron's Study, in which every thing has a disorderly Appearance. The Baron, assisted by Conrad puts his coat on. BAR. —(Looks at his watch.) —Half past eight!—My carriage!
Con. I dare say it is ready, my lord.
                                         [Exit. Bar. —(Shuts his desk, and locks it—takes his hat and stick walks to the door—opens it—seems, for a moment, lost in reflection —shuts it again). —He is a debauchee—he has a private intrigue.— (Puts his hat and stick away—draws his night-gown on,—opens his desk—seats himself and begins to write.) —Dear unhappy Caroline—
Enter Mrs. Lenton . Len. My Lord, the coach is ready.
Bar. Who wants it?
Len. Is not your lordship going to the general?

[Page 2]
Bar. You are mad. What reason can I have for going again to the general?
Len. I understood you wished to make enquiries respecting the Ensign.
Bar. I did that just now, when I was there
Len. How!
Bar. He is a debauchee—he has a private intrigue.
Len. —(Aside.) —Heavens! His disorder is violent to-day.
Bar. He is like the rest of mankind.— (With acrimony.) — What a nest of vipers is this world!
Len. Recollect yourself, my dear sir.—You have not been out of doors to-day.
Bar. —(Enraged.) —Does the woman mean to imply that I have lost my senses?—At half past eight I was completely dressed, and it is now— (Looking at his watch.) —Five and [25]   thir— (Astonished.) —Why, I have only been dressed five minutes.
Len. Of course, therefore, it is impossible that your lordship can have been to the general's.
Bar. Hem!—That's mighty odd!—Now could I almost swear that the general said to me: “He is a debauchee, and has a private intrigue.”
Len. My lord, this is one of the usual tricks played by your imagination. It arises from our ignorance of the Ensign's affairs.
Bar. —(After a pause.) —She is right—I recollect— Is he gone out again?
Len. Yes—as usual.
Bar. True, true!—I shall not even find one honest man to close my eyes.
Len. My Lord—your daughter—your Sophia—
Bar. Will have the fate of Caroline—will be seduced by
[Page 3]
a libertine.—But hold!—Where is my letter?—I must write.
Len. —(Aside.) —Who can this Caroline be, that so constantly occupies his mind?—Again writing! That must not be allowed.— (Aloud.) —My lord, not far from us an accident has happened.
Bar. —(Alarmed.) —An accident!
Len. A careless coachman has driven over a poor child.
Bar. —(Still more agitated.) [50]   —Driven over it!—Is it dead?
Len. No. There are still hopes that it may recover. It is our washerwoman's child. If your lordship would but assist the poor people with a trifle—
Bar. Damnation! No.—I will not give them any thing.
Len. —(Aside.) —If he were but compassionate when the paroxysm is upon him—
Bar. Let the world repay me that, of which it has robbed me,—then I will do good.
Len. —(Aside.) —How long the doctor remains away this morning!
Bar. —(Taking up his book.) —Our washerwoman's child, said you?
Len. Yes, my lord.
                                         Bar. writes in the book. Enter Sophia . Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —How is he to-day?
Len. But indifferent.
Sop. Good morning, sir.
Bar. Your servant, doctor.
Sop. It is I, dear father.
Bar. —(Looking around.) —Oh!—Well, what do you want?
Sop. A widow whose name is Walner, waits—

[Page 4]
Bar. —(Astonished.) —Walner!— (Enraged.) —Who is she?—What does she want?
Sop. [75]   She has requested me to ask you—(and, dear father, tears trickled down her cheeks while she spoke) by what conduct she has been so unfortunate as to lose her monthly allowance, which your charity—
Bar. —(With a look of fury.) —Allowance!—Charity, who made her any allowance? I?
Sop. So she says.
Bar. The devil may, perhaps, have allowed her something —but not I.—Turn her out of the house.
Sop. Oh Heavens!
                                         [She is going. Bar. Sophia, come back.—Give me your purse.
Sop. There it is.
Bar. Is this all the money you have?
Sop. It is.
Bar. —(Throws it into the desk.) —Now send her away.
                                         [Exit Soph. Bar. —(Writes in his book.) —Widow—Walner.—
Len —(Aside.) —I always understood that any one who had laboured under misfortunes would be the more ready to have compassion on his fellow-creatures when in the same situation.
Bar. —(Rises hastily.) —Does Sophia love the Ensign?
Len. How can I reply to that, my lord?
Bar. Why can you not?
Len. I have never observed any thing, which leads me to form such a conclusion.
Bar. —(After a pause.) —Where can the Ensign go?
Len. [100]   That Heaven knows; but if your lordship would give orders that some one should follow him—
Bar. What! To steal from him the secret, which he so much wishes to conceal.—It is as I said.—This world is a
[Page 5]
mass of villainy and fraud. A single innocent question causes this woman immediately to make a shameful proposition. —Fie on you, Mrs. Lenton!
Len. But if by this conduct you could make the young man happy.—
Bar. —(In a mild tone.) —Could I make him happy.— (In a violent tone.) —But why should I? What care I for the fellow?
Enter Doctor , followed by Conrad , who places a glass, a spoon, and a medicine on the table, and then withdraws. Doc. Good morning, my lord!
Bar. —(Incensed.) —I will not, I will not.— (To Len.) — Go. Doctor, you may go too. I don't like you.—
                                         [Exit Len. Doc. —(Offering the medicine.) —In the first place I beg you will swallow this.
Bar. I will not.—Shame on you! The only man, of whom I still retained a good opinion to treat me thus!
Doc. —(Coldly.) —Do you chuse to take it?
Bar. Take it yourself that you may acquire a better heart —but probably your medicines are not intended for such a purpose.
Doc. —(Still coldly.) —My lord—
Bar. I will not take it.
Doc. [125]   Then I wish you good morning.
Bar. Come—I will take it then.
Doc. —(Presents the glass.) —There!— (Feels the Baron's pulse after he has taken the medicine.) —You are in a bad state. You have been left alone too long.
Bar. Doctor, I don't like you.

[Page 6]
Doc. —(Smiling.) —I am sorry for it. In what have I displeased you?
Bar. Why did you discover me to widow Walner?
Doc. Because when you first gave me money for her, you did not desire me to conceal your charity.
Bar. Hem! That is possible.—Why have you not paid her allowance for the last month?
Doc. Because I never received it from you.
Bar. What? False, False! I never could forget that.
Doc. Be composed. You know that I never accept any money from you for the purposes of private charity, unless you make a memorandum to that effect in my presence.
Bar. I made one in the book.
Doc. Be calm.—Let us see it.
Bar. —(Opens the book, examines it, rises, and takes the Doctor's hand.) —I beg your pardon.—But no, I don't beg your pardon. Why did you not rather advance the money than suffer the poor people to be in distress?
Doc. That is an error of memory, not a want of inclination. —Mrs. Walner ought to have applied to me.
Bar. [150]   Well, well—perhaps she did apply, but could not meet with you.—Here is the money. But impress upon her mind my absolute command that she must not confess who is her benefactor. And now, doctor, I must employ you in another work of charity. Our washerwoman's child has been hurt by the carelessness of a coachman. Take these ten ducats to the poor woman.
Doc. Make a memorandum of it.
Bar. —(Writes in the book.) —But not a word respecting me—not a syllable, doctor, for if half a dozen people were to learn that I am not as hard-hearted as I seem, I dare be sworn I should be a third time reduced to beggary.
Doc. —(Walking from side to side.) —That is not to be feared. Experientia docet .

[Page 7]
Bar. Sixth—seventh—What day of the month is this?
Doc. —(Still walking to and fro.) —The eighth of August. — (Bar. writes.) —My lord, I fear you have had a very uneasy night, and I think a little exercise is absolutely necessary. But—why so long in writing a name?— (Looks over his shoulder into the book.) —“Return, dear Caroline, and forgive”—My lord,—
Bar. What now?
Doc. Do you write letters in your memorandum-book?
Bar. —(Looks at the book and casts it from him.) —Pshaw!
Doc. Come, let us take an airing.
Bar. [175]   Why am I thus tormented? Why does sleep never visit my eyes? Why do I lose my memory? Why do I hate the world?—Because I was a man—because I followed the impulse of my passions.
Doc. My lord, far be it from me to pry into your secret.— But as your state of mind becomes daily—
Bar. No, doctor, my secret shall die with me.—Suffice it that I once was a villain, and now suffer for it.
Doc. You perhaps magnify your guilt. The advice and consolation of a friend might—
Bar. —(Mournfully.) —Advice! Consolation!— (Hastily quitting the subject.) —Procure me a worthy husband for Sophia, and I shall then feel the only consolation which my heart can ever know.
Doc. I have thought you of late much attached to the Ensign—
Bar. True, but shall I bestow the girl upon a man, of whom I can gain no intelligence?
Doc. I cannot conceive—
Bar. He has a secret amour on his hands, and hence arise his debts—hence is it easy to account for his private visits.— Heavens! How did I rejoice when I first became acquainted with that man!

[Page 8]
Doc. Listen, then, to the proposals of Count Alsing.
Bar. The tiresome querist! Never!
Doc. [200]   He is a respectable man.
Bar. That I own, but he is not on that account less insufferable. The man asks more questions in a day than can be answered in a week. I should long ago have ceased to associate with him on that account, were he not in other respects a worthy man.
Doc. This fault may be removed.
Bar. Impossible! Besides he is too rich.
Doc. Too rich!—That is an odd fault indeed.
Enter Mrs. Lenton . Len. Count Alsing begs leave to pay his respects—
Bar. At another time. I am not in the humour for answering questions.
Doc. —(Apart to Len.) —The Baron must never be left so long alone. I have often mentioned this.
Len. I was detained by Miss Sophia.
Doc. Do not let it happen again.
                                         [Exit Len. Bar. See! Notwithstanding my message, there he is.
Enter Count . Cou. Your most obedient, my lord. Doctor, your servant. May I ask how you do to-day, my lord?
Bar. So, so.
Cou. And Miss Sophia?
Bar. I don't know.
Cou. The Ensign, I presume, is, as usual, from home?
Bar. I don't know.
Cou. You have not seen him to-day, then?

[Page 9]
Bar. —(Aside.) [225]   —The devil take the fellow and his questions!
Doc. Since I have been here, his lordship has not.
Cou. Have you heard any account of the circumstance which happened on parade yesterday?
Bar. No.
Cou. That surprizes me.—The ensign has not acquainted you with it, then?— (Bar. hums a tune.) —Have not you heard any thing of it, doctor?
Doc. Circumstances which occur on parade do not interest me.
Cou. But you know, my lord, that Lembach a lieutenant in our regiment died yesterday?
Bar. —(Aside.) —Plague on this fellow!
Doc. No. The Baron was ignorant of this.
Cou. Well, let me relate the circumstance The general was in conversation with several officers relative to the sudden death of the lieutenant, and turning to the ensign said: “Vizar, I hear you are involved in debt. I have it now in my power to make you a lieutenant, if I like.” “As your Excellency may think proper,” replied the ensign, “though I should not be surprised if another were put above me, that having thrice happened to me.” It shall be so a fourth time” retorted the general, and turned away.
Bar. —(Aside.) —He shall have the girl.
Cou. The general has since said a great deal relative to the [250]   Ensign's impertinence.
Bar. Damnation! Because he will not descend to cringe and flatter.
Cou. Oh my dear lord, valour and attention to the service will not suffice. I should perhaps have still been an ensign had I not in a certain way secured the interest of the general's valet-de-chambre .
Bar. Then I wish you were an ensign.

[Page 10]
Cou. Arrogance and poverty are not suitable companions, my lord.
Bar. How long has a becoming spirit been termed arrogance?
Cou. Ever since the flood, when combined with an empty purse.—If the Ensign had not friends—
Bar. Friends! May I die if he has one!
Doc. —(Ironically.) —Unless it be the Count.
Cou. I am his friend, and therefore am displeased at his conduct towards the General.
Doc. A real friend would step forward in his behalf. His debts—
Cou. I would willingly have paid; but am I answerable for his false delicacy.
Bar. Willingly have paid!—I doubt that, my lord.
Cou. Such a doubt is an attack upon my honour. Ask the Ensign if I did not give him as much as he would take.
Bar. —(Apart to Doc.) [275]   —Repay him what the Ensign borrowed.
Doc. He probably only wished for a moderate sum.
Cou. Doctor, you will offend me, if you talk thus. He asked for two hundred dollars, and received them on the spot.
Doc. —(Turning to the Bar.) —My lord, have the goodness to lend me that sum 'till I come hither in the evening.
Bar. With all my heart.
                                         [Counts the money and writes in his book. Cou. How! What! I shall not accept the money from you, doctor.
Doc. You will, if I explain myself more fully. What I do is by the desire of a relation.
Cou. Indeed! Has the Ensign any relations?
Doc. He has.

[Page 11]
Cou. In this country?
Doc. No.
Cou. Where, then?
Doc. In—Sweden.
Cou. In Sweden! He has probably changed his name, then?
Doc. That I don't know.
Cou. But why did not this relation interest himself sooner in the Ensign's behalf?
Doc. Because, because he did not know that the Ensign [300]   was here.
Cou. And did you tell him?
Doc. Did you receive any note from the Ensign?
Cou. Yes, but it will not be due till a fortnight is expired.
Doc. Never mind that. The best way is to settle the matter directly.
Cou. But the Ensign may be offended that I mentioned the circumstance.
Doc. He shall not learn it from me.
Cou. I now perceive that it was a thoughtless action on my part—
Doc. By no means!
Cou. He is a worthy young man, to whom I am under obligations.
Doc. How so?
Cou. Through him I became acquainted with the Baron and Miss Sophia. Through him I hope to be shortly the happiest of men.
Doc. The last position I do not understand.
Cou. Don't you, indeed?
Doc. No, on my honour.
Cou. What happiness can I want, if Sophia be mine?
Doc. Of course you argue upon certain grounds.

[Page 12]
Cou. Not exactly, for as yet I have received no answer to my proposals either from the Baron or Miss Sophia.
Doc. [325]   Indeed!
Bar. —(Has in the mean time put his coat on, and taken his hat.) —Conrad!
Doc. What now, my lord? Where are you going?
Bar. To the general's. It is high time.
Doc. —(Aside.) —Another whim! Not a moment ought he to be left to himself.
Enter Conrad . Bar. The carriage instantly.
                                         [Exit Con. Doc. Have you made a memorandum—
Bar. Of what?
Doc. Of the two hundred dollars which you said you would lend me.
Bar. —(Looks at his book.) —I have.
Doc. But the money—
Bar. Why, you took it.
                                         [Locks the desk. Doc. I!—You are mistaken, my lord.
Bar. I certainly.— (Puts his hand into his pocket.) — Strange enough!—Here it is.—Take it.
Doc. —(Gives the money to the Count.) —There, my lord.
Cou. —(Gives him the note.) —You are sure the Ensign will not be offended?
Doc. Certainly not, for he shall never know it.
Cou. So you are going to the general, my lord?
Bar. —(Aside.) —Damn his questions.
Doc. —(Apart to Bar.) —Don't give way to anger.
Cou. Probably respecting the Ensign?
Bar. —(Aside.) [350]   —Well—I feel in the humour for retorting.
Cou. Do you think, my lord, that I—

[Page 15]
Bar. Apropos! Is it a fine day?
Cou. Very fine. I—
Bar. Did it rain yesterday?
Cou. Yesterday! No, for I—
Bar. Are you fond of field-diversions?
Cou. Extremely, for I—
Bar. Have you seen the papers to-day?
Cou. Yes. You have heard of the—
Bar. How long have you been in the service?
Cou. Since I was fourteen years old, but—
Bar. When will you be upon guard?
Cou. The day after to-morrow. Letters from Paris—
Bar. Do you breakfast on tea or coffee?
Cou. Coffee. Letters from Paris—
Bar. Where do you dine to-day?
Cou. At the mess. The accounts from Paris—
Bar. Have you seen any service?
Cou. —(Aside.) —What a tormenter.— (Aloud.) —Yes, I—
Bar. Do you like wine better than water?
Cou. Of course. But allow me to relate—
Bar. Do you sleep on a feather-bed, or a matrass?
Cou. Both.— (Aside.) —He is insufferable.
Enter Conrad . Con. [375]   The carriage is ready, my lord.
Bar. Who wants it?
Doc. You promised you would take an airing with me.
Cou. Why the Baron said he would go to the General.
Doc. I know what is best for him. Come, my lord.
Bar. I'll send Sophia to you. I am sorry that I am obliged to leave you, for I wanted to ask you a few more questions.

[Page 14]
Cou. Allow me a single one.
Bar. No, no. One will not satisfy you.
Cou. It will, I assure you. May I hope to be your son?
Bar. Have you a good fortune?
Cou. That I can indisputably prove to you. I have two large estates—
Bar. Sell them, quit the service, and throw all your ready money into the first ditch you meet with.
Cou. Why, I should be a beggar in that case.
Bar. A beggar will be my son-in-law.
Cou. A singular resolution!—And why?
Bar. I may, then, with some reason expect a portion of gratitude and affection.
Cou. Do you think, then—
Bar. That's the third question since your promise.— Good morning, Count.
                                         [Exeunt Bar. and Doc. Cou. The baron labours under one of his usual attacks.— [400]   I will not yet renounce my hopes.—“A beggar will be my son-in-law.” Hem! He must have thereby meant the Ensign. Well, well. I can but use my utmost efforts, and if I lose Sophia, I will console myself with the idea that a girl of good fortune is more necessary to him than to me.
Enter Sophia and Mrs. Lenton . Sop. —(As she enters.) —Oh, I shall be driven mad with ridiculous questions.
Cou. Your most obedient servant, Miss Sophia. May I ask how you do this morning?
Sop. I am not well.
Cou. Not well. I am very sorry to hear it. Head-ach?
Sop. No.
Cou. Tooth-ach?
Sop. No.

[Page 15]
Cou. A degree of fever?
Sop. No.
Cou. Anxiety?
Sop. No.
Cou. May I ask what is your complaint?
Sop. I have not had sufficient sleep.— (Apart to Len.) —What a tiresome being!
Cou. I sincerely pity you. May I ask what disturbed your sleep? Disagreeable dreams?
Sop. No.
Cou. Or a noise in the neighbourhood?
Sop. [425]   No
Cou. Or the carriages in the street?
Sop. No. It was late when I went to bed.
Cou. Indeed! May I ask what was the cause of this? You were probably in company at a friend's house?
Sop. No.
Cou. Or had a party at home?
Sop. No.
Cou. Perhaps you lost at cards, or—
Sop. I had no party, but played with my father because he could not sleep.
Cou. Indeed! At what game? Piquet?
Sop. No.
Cou. Cribbage?
Sop. No.
Cou. Mrs. Lenton perhaps made a third at L'Hombre?
Len. No. Chess was the game, my lord.— (Aside.) — What an insufferable creature!
Cou. Chess! Ha! Ha! Ha!—I should like to see the Baron play at Chess, of all men in the world.
Sop. I beg leave to mention that my father must not be ridiculed in his own house, and in his daughter's presence.

[Page 16]
Cou I intreat your pardon a thousand times. But to change the subject, may I ask whether you have reflected on the question, which I was bold enough to make a few [450]   days since?
Sop. No, my lord.
Cou. Indeed!—That is cruel. May I ask why not?
Sop. As I have the pleasure of hearing at least two hundred questions from your lordship whenever I have the honour of being in your company I do not know to which you refer.
Cou. To which! I have but one question of consequence, and that is whether I may hope to call you mine?
Sop. That question I cannot answer.
Cou. May I ask why?
Sop. Because I have a father.
Cou. Were I so happy as to gain his consent, would your's accompany it?
Sop. I answer nothing prematurely.— (Apart to Len.) — Rid me of this plague.
Cou. Don't you think you could live comfortably and happily with me?
Len. This is a very fine day.
Cou. You don't answer me, Miss Sophia?
Sop. It is almost a shame to stay in the house.
Cou. Does any other attachment oppose my wishes?
Sop. My father has acted wisely in taking an airing.
Cou. May I hope for an answer?———Shall I wish you good morning, Miss Sophia?
Sop. [475]   I wish you good morning, my lord.
Cou. Madam, how have I deserved this contempt?
Sop. Contempt! I thought you were taking your leave.
Cou. No, dear Sophia.
Sop. Then I beg your pardon; but I must add that the honour of your visit will be more welcome to me at another time, for I am really not well.

[Page 17]
Cou. I obey. May I ask whether I shall be troublesome this afternoon?
Sop. By no means, my lord. I shall be happy to see you.
Cou. May I ask—but of that we will converse at large hereafter. Your most obedient!
                                         [Exit. Sop. At length he is gone. What a burden is his society! How insipid his enquiries!
Len. He did not chuse to understand you.
Sop. Yet I spoke plainly.
Len. What a pity it is that he makes himself so disagreeable by his incessant questions.
Sop. What a difference between him and the Ensign!
Len. —(Aside.) —Was the Baron right in his conjectures?
Sop. He usually comes in about this time.
Len. Who?
Sop. The Ensign.
Len. His lordship was highly exasperated against him [500]   this morning.
Sop. Heavens! on what account?
Len. On account of his secret visits.
Sop. It is indeed strange that he should always go out at one time.
Len. Your father thinks some private attachment—
Sop. —(Alarmed.) —Attachment!
Len. Which is not very creditable to him—
Sop. Dreadful!
Len. Is the cause of his mysterious conduct, as well as of his debts.
Sop. —(After a pause.) —No, my dear Mrs. Lenton, I don't believe it.
Len. Sophia! Sophia! All is not as it should be.
Sop. With respect to what?
Len. Your heart.

[Page 18]
Sop. I beg your pardon. With respect to my heart all is exactly as it should be.
Len. No reserve towards me, Sophia. You know I do not deserve it. No mother can feel more interested in the welfare of a child than I in your's.
Sop. Alas—dear Mrs. Lenton!
Len. Be upon your guard against this passion. Your artless simplicity protects you less from the impressions and consequences of love than I suspected. The plain education [525]   you have had is unable sufficiently to counteract the poison you have imbibed. To me it seems almost impossible that the Ensign can ever be your's. Your father's regard for him daily diminishes, but the Ensign's conduct remains unaltered.
Sop. But if his motives be praiseworthy—
Len. A praiseworthy motive for involving himself in debt! I never heard of any.
Sop. My heart assures me that he will justify his conduct in a way creditable to himself.
Len. Your heart, dear Sophia, is a surety, in which I cannot place implicit confidence.
Sop. If my father be but patient—
Len. I fear he will not.
Sop. He becomes every day more harsh and discontented.
Len. What a man was he, when I first entered his house! He was always sorrowful, to be sure, but mild, humane, and charitable.—About eight years ago he received a letter, which almost drove him to distraction. Unconnected expressions, relating to meanness, imposition and villainy, were all that I learnt of its contents. Since that time, execrations and curses are the only alms, which he distributes to the needy. Since he received that odious letter, he has been sickly, absent, and devoid of pity.

[Page 19]
Sop. He is my father—I must not complain.—But, dear [550]   Mrs Lenton, what a strange whim it was to leave me among peasants 'till I was nine years old, without any person to instruct me!
Len. That was perhaps caused by a too anxious solicitude for your health.
Sop. But though this kind of life was his own choice, he now often reproaches me with it. Whenever he is incensed, he tells me that all my ideas are those of a peasant.
Len. We must all bear with his disposition.— (A knock is heard at the door.) —Come in.
Enter the Ensign . Ens. —(Starts.) —I beg pardon, Miss Sophia. I thought his lordship—
Sop. He will soon be here again. He is only taking a short airing with the doctor.
Ens. If I be not troublesome—
Sop. How can you suppose that?
Ens. The unfortunate are always afraid of being troublesome.
Sop. Unfortunate!— (Apart to Len.) —May I not try to learn his secret?
Len. —(Apart to Sop.) —Take care he does not discover your's.
Sop. Pray be seated.— (They take chairs.) —You call yourself unfortunate.
Ens. I am so, Miss Sophia, I am so, and at present more unfortunate than ever, for I have lost all hope.
Sop. [575]   How so? What has happened to you?
Ens. I yesterday answered the general as a man of honour ought to answer, and am now certain that I shall have no promotion in this country.

[Page 20]
Len. Is this country the whole world?
Ens. To me it is, for I dare not leave it.
Sop. Dare not?
Ens. And cannot, if I durst.
Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —That relates to me.
Len. —(Apart to Sop.) —Or to his private visits.
Sop. —(Aloud.) —If you were to discover your situation to my father—
Ens. Discover what?
Sop. The cause of your distress.
Ens. Miss Sophia, did your father ever assist any one in distress?
Sop. —(Abashed.) —Would that I were able to answer in the affirmative! But your case will certainly be an exception.
Ens. Why?
Sop. Because he feels interested in your behalf. This is evinced by his dissatisfaction at your mysterious visits.
Ens. Mysterious visits!
Sop. Yes. The visits which you make so regularly thrice every day. Are they the cause of your not daring to leave this country— (Ens. turns away) —and of your not [600]   being able to leave it if you durst?
Ens. No, by Heavens, Miss Sophia. The cause is in myself.
Sop. Even if these mysterious visits did not exist?
Ens. Oh, then should I be a thousand times less able, to leave this country.
                                         [Rises. Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —That surely was a reference to me.
Len. —(Apart to Sop.) —Don't forget yourself.
Sop. —(To the Ens.) —I wish I might be your confidante.
Ens. Oh, Miss Sophia, how willingly, were I allowed to discover the sorrows of my mind to you—how willingly—
                                         [Turns away.
[Page 21]
Len. —(Aside.) —They become more and more confidential. This must not be.
Sop. Confide in me, I beseech you Fancy you are conversing with a sister—
Len. Sophia!
Sop. —(Discontented.) —What do you want?
Len. Remember that this confidential intercourse may not be agreeable to your father.
Ens. You are right, Mrs Lenton. Farewell, Miss Sophia.
Len. But your society will by no means be disagreeable to him.
Sop. Oh certainly not. Stay, my dear sir.
Enter Conrad . Con. A letter for you, sir.
Ens. [625]   By the post?
Con. No. It was brought by a man, whom I don't know.
Ens. Does he wait for an answer?
Con. No, sir. He is gone.
Ens. Very well.— (Puts the letter in his pocket.) —
                                         [Exit Con. Sop. I beg you will read it. I equally sympathize in your joy and grief. My heart forebodes that this letter contains pleasant news.
Ens. Oh, Miss Sophia, your goodness overpowers me.— Your pardon!
                                         [Opens the letter. Len. —(Apart to Sop. while he is reading.) —You betray yourself.
Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —By no means. My expressions are perfectly harmless.
Ens. Am I awake?
Sop. Joyful tidings as I said?

[Page 22]
Ens. Most joyful! Most astonishing! Listen, Miss Sophia. — (Reads.) —“That you may be in some degree relieved from your unpleasant situation the inclosed trifle is sent you by a man, who neither expects nor will accept any return.”—By Heavens, my eyes deceive me.—A present of a hundred Louis d'ors from one who expects no return—and in the year 1800!
Sop. You perceive you still have friends.
Ens. [650]   Who can it be?— (After a pause.) —Can your father—
Sop. —(Sighing.) —I wish I could think it possible.
Ens. —(After meditating awhile.) —Or—no, that is equally improbable.
Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —I am sure it was not sent by my father.
Len. I think it is much more likely that it is sent by the Great Mogul.
Ens. There is no mistake in the direction.—No, as I live —Allow me to withdraw, Miss Sophia.—My heart is so full.—At this time, just at this time, when—a hundred Louis d'ors—from a stranger—who will accept no return— and 1800!——
                                         [Exit. Sop. Dear Mrs. Lenton, how few good people must the Ensign have met with, since this gift so much surprizes him; yet God knows if I had it—
Len. You would give so much away that you would at last be obliged to receive favours from others in your turn. Follow the middle path, Sophia.
Sop. Who can the generous man be?
Len. How if it were not a man?
Sop. Oh!—That idea pierced me to my very heart.
Len. How if it came from the secret retreat?
Sop. Oh!—But surely he would have harboured some suspicions.

[Page 23]
Len. [675]   Perhaps he did.
Sop. You are right, dear friend—perhaps he did. I must forget him—never speak to him again—see him as seldom as possible.—Let him continue to love his concealed beauty.
Len. Silence!—The Baron is coming.
Enter Baron and Doctor . Bar. Is the Ensign within?
Len. He is, my lord.
Sop. Only think, dear father! He has just received a letter from an unknown person, which contains a present of a hundred Louis d'ors.
Bar. A hundred Louis d'ors! What a blockhead the unknown person must be!
Doc. It is a singular circumstance.
Sop. We have suspected that the money came from—
Bar. Whom?
Sop. You, dear father.
Bar. Are you mad? Do you fancy that I would throw away a hundred Louis d'ors upon a man, whose suspicious conduct has so long vexed me; and whom I shall shortly turn out of doors, unless he pays for his lodgings?
Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —Do you hear that?
Len. —(Apart to Sop.) —The money came from the mysterious retreat.
Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —Pray, pray be silent.
Bar. Mrs. Lenton, go and ask the Ensign to dine with us.
Len. —(Aside.) [700]   —Now that he has some money.—What a strange man!
                                         [Exit. Doc. The whole story is, perhaps, fabricated by himself. Did you see the letter and the money, Miss Sophia?
Sop. —(In an angry tone.) —Yes, sir, I saw both.

[Page 24]
Doc. Then it is, of course, a present from the unknown family, which he visits.
Sop. —(Aside.) —He knows of this too.
Bar. Sophia, see that dinner is forwarded. The querist will be of our party, too.
Sop. Count Alsing!
Bar. Yes. I met him while I was out.
Sop. Then we shall be so plagued with questions, that it will be impossible to eat a morsel.
                                         [Exit. Doc. I wish I had been an eye-witness of his delight. To what purpose will he apply the money? That his character sufficiently demonstrates. Why so thoughtful, my lord? Can you feel unhappy after having done so good an action?
Bar. I was thinking how I would torment the Count with questions at dinner.
Doc. Right, my lord. Mirth and good humour are the best medicines I can prescribe.
Bar. The deuce is in it! I can't call to mind a single question.
Doc. [725]   I had almost forgot to mention that when I stepped out of the carriage, while you were in conversation with the Count—
Bar. Yes. At that time I could think of questions enough, but now—
Doc. I went into the apothecary's shop, and learnt in confidence, that the Ensign has had medicines there throughout the last half year without having yet paid any thing for them. By the prescriptions I perceived that the patient was afflicted with an asthmatic complaint.
Bar. Right. I'll ask him whether he has an asthmatic complaint, as he talks so little.
Doc. You probably did not hear what I said, my lord?

[Page 25]
Bar. Eh?—No.—I'll ask him, whether he did not, as soon as he came into the world, enquire what he was to do here.
Doc. —(Aside.) —Poor man! Yet it is better that he should be cheerful than sorrowful.
Enter Mrs. Lenton . Len. Count Alsing is arrived, my lord. Shall I order the servants to lay the cloth?
Bar. Yes, yes, yes. Have at you, Count. I'll make you tired of questions, I promise you.— (Leans on the Doctor's arm.) —Come along, doctor. Come, my dear doctor. Help me to torment the querist.
                                         [Exeunt Bar. and Doc. Len. What spirits! Heaven have mercy on him! His [750]   end must be near.
                                         [Exit.

END OF ACT I.

[Page 26]
ACT II. Scene Scene.—The Baron's Dining-Room. Baron, Count, Doctor, Sophia, and Mrs. Lenton are seated at Table. Conrad and Francis are engaged in removing every Thing from the Table. Len. Look once more, and look carefully. It cannot be gone.
Con. I have looked twenty times. A spoon and a napkin are wanting.
Bar. So you never were abroad, Count?
Cou. No, my lord.— (To Doc. —How he plagues me with his questions. I must go.
Doc. Hold, my lord. The questions keep his mind from more disagreeable subjects, and are good for his health.
Cou. But answers are bad for mine. They irritate my nerves.
Bar. Do you like to dine by day-light or candle-light?
Cou. —(Apart to Doc.) —There again!
Doc. —(Apart to Cou.) —Pray answer him.
Cou. —(Aloud.) —By candle-light.
                                         [Exeunt Con. and Fra. Bar. Do you usually take a nap or a walk after dinner?
Cou. A walk. I wish you a good day.
Bar. Are you really a going?

[Page 27]
Cou. I shall only take a few turns in your garden, and then wait on you again.— (Bows to all; aside, as he goes.) — The devil himself would be driven away by such absurd questions.
                                         [Exit.                                          [The Bar. poizes himself in his chair and laughs. Sop. —(Who has in the mean time been in warm conversation with Len.) —Fie! That is a shameful suspicion.
Len. —(Half aloud.) —They can't have vanished.
Bar. [25]   What's the matter there?
Len. A spoon and a napkin are lost.
Bar. Since we sat down?
Len. Yes, and as nobody quitted the room so immediately and hastily as—
Bar. As who?
Sop. Mrs. Lenton!
Len. As the Ensign—
Bar. Pshaw! Does the Devil possess the woman? But true—he is a man—it is possible.
Doc. No, my lord. I will be surety, on my life for the Ensign.
Sop. So will I.
Len. Then only mention any other probable way of accounting for it.
Doc. That is needless. He is incapable of such a deed.
Bar. He is a man—consequently capable of any thing.
Doc. Now, when possessed of a hundred Louis d'ors—
Len. His haste to procure cash for the bill seemed very unnecessary, I thought.
Sop. Shame on you for the suspicion!
Doc. Is it not possible that he has debts, which must be instantly paid?
Len. Why, to be sure—but—
Bar. Have you made strict search?—
Len. [50]   Innumerable times!

[Page 28]
Bar. It is improbable—but still possible.
Doc. My lord, how can you think so?—An officer—a man of honour—
Len. —(Ironically.) —Then there must be a hobgoblin in the house.
Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —Unless you are silent, I'll never forgive you.
Bar. Yes, some hobgoblin has played us a trick.
Doc. Is there no other conjecture to be formed?
Bar. Do you know any?
Doc. Conjecture I say, not probability. How if this were an attempt to make the Ensign appear guilty?
Len. That is not likely on the part of the Baron, Sophia, or yourself; the Count, therefore, or I—
Doc. I accuse nobody. I only speak of possibilities.
Sop. Dearest father.
Bar. Go, Sophia. I wish to have a little conversation with the doctor.
                                         [Exeunt Sop. and Len. Doc. My lord, I am astonished that the nonsensical ideas of this foolish old woman can make any impression upon you.
Bar. Did I say that I believed it? I only say it is possible.
Doc. No, it is impossible, my lord.
Bar. Pshaw! Don't attempt to defend mankind. Had [75]   you learnt as much of the world by experience as I have, you would alter your opinions.
Doc. Then I thank heaven that I have not had your experience. —But my lord, your words and actions disagree. You talk like a misanthrope, and seek the distressed even in the remotest corners for the purpose of relieving them.
Bar. Because I am a fool—because my heart is weaker than my reason. But I have firmly abided by my oath, never to be charitable but by proxy.

[Page 29]
Doc. And have thereby deprived yourself of many moments, which would have been grateful to your feelings.
Bar. Can you imagine that gratitude ever existed in the nature of man? No. You may far sooner succeed in making me believe every thing which the heated imagination of the poet generates, than this. Why, therefore, should I make my charities known, when I expect no gratitude, and only wish not to be imposed upon?—But come, doctor, as you think the world so good, listen to my history, and then accuse me of injustice if you can. You shall, at the same time, learn the cause of all my sorrows, but do not despise me, for my sufferings have been great,—my penitence sincere.
Doc. If you have erred, there is many an intercessor, who will sue for you hereafter.
Bar. After the death of my father, who left me a large [100]   estate, I became acquainted with a girl of good family, whose only fortune was her virtue. After incessant and fruitless attempts to rob her of this, I began to talk of marriage, and my proposals were joyfully accepted by her and her mother. The contract was signed—the day fixed— but a short time previous to which, in the most accursed moment of my existence, I triumphed over her honour, and was immediately resolved to forsake her for ever. I entrusted my brother with full power to convert my estates into money, and follow me to France.
Doc. Heavens!
Bar. The punishment of my infamous conduct followed close upon it. My brother informed me by letter that Caroline had vanished, and postponed his departure under various pretexts. Suddenly his remittances ceased to come. I wrote and was told, in reply, that my estates were sold, and that no one knew any thing of my brother I was at that time in debt, and was soon after imprisoned My liberty
[Page 30]
was, in a short time, again granted, because it was discovered that I had harboured no fraudulent intentions— but I was a beggar.
Doc. Poor man!
Bar. A war took place. I enlisted, and in ten years rose from the rank of a private to that of a captain. Our general, whose life I had thrice saved, expired in my arms, and [125]   made me the heir to his extensive property.
Doc. Singular fate!
Bar. I resigned, and wandered through Germany in search of Caroline, that I might make reparation for my injustice towards her. I will not relate to you how often my unsuspecting confidence has been imposed upon. Suffice it to say, that but eight years since I was, by indefatigable exertions, rescued from utter ruin. Then it was that I made a vow to appear hard-hearted in the eyes of the world, but secretly to follow the impulse of my disposition, and as often as I could, relieve the distresses of my fellow-creatures.— Oh, if you knew how difficult I have often found it to support the character I have assumed—
Doc. Of that I have innumerable proofs.—And all your attempts to discover Caroline have been in vain?
Bar. All, all.—She is, doubtless, dead.
Doc. But I do not comprehend how Miss Sophia—your daughter—
Bar. Oh, she is—my daughter. To protect her from the fate of Caroline, and bestow her hand upon a worthy man is all I wish.—The Ensign seemed to me the man I wanted. —He is poor, and this gave me a claim upon his gratitude. —The worthless—

[Page 31]
Enter Conrad in haste. Con. Doctor, you are requested to attend Baron Klinsberg, who is suddenly taken ill in the neighbourhood.
Doc. [150]   I come.— (Exit Con.) —Do not be exasperated with regard to the Ensign. I conjure you, be composed, and leave the explanation to time. I shall return as soon as possible.
                                         [Exit. Bar. I thought my brother honest too—yet he proved a villain.—All, all alike!
Enter Sophia and Mrs. Lenton . Sop. I never will forgive you.
Len. I should be truly happy to find myself—
Sop. How angry my father looks—and all on account of your absurd suspicions!
Bar. —(Aside.) —All, all alike!—Then why do I assist them? Because I also was a villain twenty years ago? That is the only reason.
Enter the Ensign . Sop. The Ensign, dear—
Bar. Be quiet, doctor, I'll hear no more.
Sop. Dear father, the Ensign.
Ens. My lord, I am ashamed to confess that I have been longer indebted to you than I ought to have been, or wished. Allow me most sincerely to thank you, and—
                                         [Presents money. Bar. For what do I receive this?

[Page 32]
Ens. For the rent of my lodgings.
Bar. Oh—very well.— (Aside.) —Let me see whether he will betray himself.— (Aloud.) —Punctuality is praiseworthy in a young man.
Ens. I have lamented, my lord, that you have not discovered [175]   this quality in me. Had not an unexpected and most fortunate circumstance occurred, I should have been under the necessity of making a further appeal to your kindness and patience.
Bar. How so?
Ens. Has not Miss Sophia related to your lordship—
Bar. No—nothing.
Ens. That an unknown friend has sent me a present of a hundred Louis d'ors?
Bar. Hem! Are there such fools in the world?
Ens. Oh do not call the first of human virtues folly.— (With a degree of asperity.) —What a wretch is he, who knows not the celestial transport of doing good!
Bar. But what a far greater wretch is he, who has by singular experience discovered that benevolence and kindness are not fables, yet at the very same time is guilty of a mean action.
Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —Heavens!—You see what you have done.
                                         [Exit. Ens. That I think impossible.
Bar. Impossible! Let me relate to you a circumstance, which happened to me in my younger days. About eighteen years ago I became acquainted with a man, who was— who was a lawyer. He talked of honesty and integrity—he was poor—in short my regard for him increased, and as a [200]   proof of it I gave him a ring of considerable value. On the very same day he dined with me—and stole my watch. What say you to this?

[Page 33]
Ens. My lord, our argument was whether he, who was susceptible of humanity and kindness, could be guilty of a mean action. The man to whom you allude was an execrable villain, incapable of feeling an obligation.
Bar. But I tell you he talked so much about integrity and honesty.— (While saying this, he puts his hand into his pocket, draws out the napkin and spoon—starts, throws them at Len. embraces the Ens. with fervour, strikes his forehead and rushes out.)
Ens. —(In the utmost astonishment.) —What means all this?—Follow him Mrs. Lenton.
[Len. who has concealed the napkin and spoon, and is standing abashed at a distance, approaches, kisses his hand, and exit.] Ens. Now, by Heaven, this is the strangest scene I even witnessed.—Has the Baron's odd manner extended to every member of the family?—This conversation—the sudden transition—and the Baron left alone!—He may perhaps—I must look.— (Goes to the door of the adjoining room.) —He reclines his head upon his hand, and appears quiet.
Enter Sophia and Mrs. Lenton . Sop. Oh my dear sir!—Dare I—may I—I must speak to my father.
                                         [Exit. Ens. Mrs. Lenton, pray explain to me the cause of the Baron and your mysterious conduct.
Len. —(Confounded.) —Sir, you are in some degree acquainted with his lordship's state of mind.—The anecdote, which he related to you—affected him—because—ingratitude —and I sympathize with him,—because—because I [225]   believe his malady arises from misanthropy alone.
                                         [Exit. Ens. To judge of all men by one!—But that alas, is often the case. It is a weakness of human nature, and a very lamentable one.

[Page 34]
Enter Count . Cou. May I ask where Miss Sophia is?
Ens. With her father.
Cou. Have you seen her since I was here?
Ens. Yes, she passed through this room in great haste just now. I believe the Baron is again indisposed.——My lord, you had the goodness, some time since, to render me assistance, when I was very much in want of it.—I am happy that it is in my power to perform my promise.
Cou. May I ask what you mean?
Ens. You lent me two hundred dollars, which I now repay with very sincere thanks.
                                         [Presents the money. Cou. —(Aside.) —Zounds! What a scrape am I in! I wish I had been quiet.— (Aloud.) —If it be not offensive, allow me to ask—
Ens. How I obtained this money? That I'll tell you with great pleasure. To my friends and foes, to all whom I know, and even to those whom I do not know I will relate it, in order that my benefactor may at length know how gratefully I acknowledge his goodness and bounty—in order that he may at length be discovered, and become the object of every worthy person's respect, and admiration.
Cou. [250]   You really excite my curiosity. May I ask—
Ens. This morning when I was with Miss Sophia—
Cou. Were you alone with her?
Ens. No. Mrs. Lenton was present. This morning— when tradesmen had been making fruitless applications to me—when all my money, all my credit was at an end—some unknown person sent me a hundred Louis d'ors.
Cou. —(Aside.) —The doctor, of course.

[Page 35]
Ens. Oh, if the generous man knew at what a time, from what a situation he relieved me—
Cou. There is, perhaps, not quite so much generosity in it as you suppose.
Ens. Such is the Baron's language.—What a bad opinion must you both have of human nature!—Take your money, my lord, and with it my heart-felt gratitude.
Cou. But—is your note due?
Ens. It is—because I can pay it.
Cou. Have you no further use for the money?
Ens. None, my lord. My debts are all discharged. Take the money, I beg.
Cou. I can't, indeed. I have not your note in my pocket
Ens. That is of no consequence.
Cou. I can't take it.
Ens. —(Mildly.) —Count, I am an officer as well as you. I cannot accept alms.
Enter Mrs. Lenton . Len. [275]   Don't speak loud, if you please. The Baron is asleep.
Cou. Is Miss Sophia with him?
Len. Yes.
Cou. Will she not soon come hither?
Len. No, my lord. The Baron must not be left alone, and I am engaged with other things.
                                         [Exit. Ens. My lord, I once more beg—
Cou. I—but zounds—when I reflect—it is my duty to discover to you all I know. No doubt you are eager to learn who was the friend, from whom you received the hundred Louis d'ors.
Ens. How! Do you know—

[Page 36]
Cou. Patience! I this morning related to the Baron your conversation with the general, and owned I was not very well pleased with you for the laconic answer, by which you had deprived yourself of promotion.
Ens. May I be deprived of it for ever, if it cannot be obtained but by meanness!
Cou. Is it mean, then—
Ens. To the subject, my lord, if you please.
Cou. A word escaped me respecting my two hundred dollars.
Ens. That was not honourable, Count.
Cou. Believe me I did it with no bad intention, but being [300]   rather angry respecting your answer to the general, the remark escaped me unawares.—In short, the Doctor insisted upon my taking the two hundred dollars from him—insisted upon it, I say, and assured me that he had orders from one of your relations, to discharge your debts privately.
Ens. Relations!
Cou. Now you can guess from what quarter the hundred Louis d'ors came.
Ens. That I cannot, by Heaven; for I know not that I have in the world more than one relation, who is more unfortunate and wretched than myself.
Cou. How! Don't you know any thing of your relations in Sweden?
Ens. In Sweden! Not I indeed.
Cou. You astonish me. Then I am very happy that I have disclosed the matter to you.
Ens. In Sweden!—It cannot be. The doctor has deceived you.
Cou. Indeed!—Well, it must be somebody, then, who resides here. If so, depend upon it I shall soon discover him.—What think you of the Baron?

[Page 37]
Ens. The Baron! Had you seen the eagerness with which he put into his pocket the trifle I paid him for my lodgings—
Cou. Can it be the Count Brenner?
Ens. As unlikely as the Baron.—In Sweden! Is it possible?
Cou. [325]   Why not? Who knows all his relations?
Enter Doctor and Mrs. Lenton . Doc. I hope, Mrs. Lenton, this example will be a sufficient warning to you.
Len. It will indeed.
                                         [Exit on the opposite side. Cou. —(Looking at his watch.) —Five o'clock! I must go to the general instantly.—Gentlemen, I leave you together. You have much to say to each other— (Apart to Ens.) — Depend upon it, I'll discover this concealed friend or relation —depend upon it.
                                         [Exit. Doc. —(Aside.) —Can he have betrayed me!
Ens. I did not flatter myself with the idea of possessing any share of your esteem.
Doc. I am a friend of the whole world, but particularly of so worthy a young man.
Ens. I am ashamed and hurt that it is not in my power to make any return for your friendship.
Doc. Bestow your's upon me in return But I first wish to have an opportunity of deserving it.
Ens. Generous man! You wish to avoid my acknowledgments.
Doc. What acknowledgments?
Ens. If not, you endeavour to conceal from me a circumstance, which is of the utmost importance to me.
Doc. I do not comprehend you.

[Page 38]
Ens. Then I must explain myself. You have paid Count Alsing too hundred dollars for me.
Doc. —(Aside.) [350]   —As I feared.
Ens. I beg you will not use any evasion. The Count himself told me this.—Do not conceal any thing from me. —I am an enigma to all my acquaintance—
Doc. True.
Ens. You can solve this enigma.
Doc. How so?
Ens. Who authorized you to pay the two hundred dollars for me?
Doc. —I—I—
Ens. You told the Count a relation in Sweden had employed you.
Doc. I would have told him a relation in Lapland, to avoid his enquiries.
Ens. And mine too?
Doc. —(Aside.) —I must positively not own the truth.
Ens. Doctor, did you pay the two hundred dollars for me?
Doc. I cannot deny it.
Ens. Then you also sent me a hundred Louis d'ors.
Doc. A hundred Louis d'ors! Indeed I did not.
Ens. Impossible!—Two such men and at the same time! —Impossible!
Doc. Would not your benefactor be more likely to be discovered by trusting to a second person?
Ens. [375]   That may be.—But with regard to what you told the Count——have I any relations in Sweden?
Doc. I cannot—dare not answer you.
Ens. —(Violently.) —By Heaven you must. The welfare of a being, who causes my sighs to ascend by night and day to Heaven, depends upon it.

[Page 39]
Doc. —(Astonished.) —Indeed!—Speak more fully—and I too will speak.
Ens. I cannot—dare not—must not. I am bound by an oath to be silent. Oh, if I might speak, your tears would flow with mine—Be satisfied with this. If I have relations, I may perhaps alleviate the sorrows of one far dearer to me than my own existence, who now— (Turning away as if he had already said too much.) —Oh God!
Doc. —(Aside.) —I am compelled to speak.— (Aloud.) — No. The friendly assistance you have received, proceeds from a worthy inhabitant of this place. I mentioned a relation in Sweden for the purpose of deceiving the Count, and depriving him of all suspicion.
Ens. —(With acrimony.) —Right, right! The wretch must not be allowed one ray of hope, lest he should cease to be wretched.—
Doc. —(Aside.) —The Baron is, unfortunately, right. A private amour is the young man's ruin.
Ens. I can now say I am completely so.
Doc. [400]   You forget your unknown friend—
Ens. Ungrateful creature that I am!—Forgive me, Oh God. Forgive my complaints. But a few hours are elapsed since thou didst prove by what strange unknown means thou can'st protect mankind.——But this friend—dare you not disclose his name?
Doc. I dare not.
Ens. Then be Heaven's blessing his reward?
Doc. He will, perhaps, soon discover himself.—Will you allow me a question?
Ens. Undoubtedly.
Doc. Your welfare is my sincere wish—Can I serve you professionally? For whom are the medicines, which you so often buy? Not for yourself?
Ens. No.— (Aside.) —Oh God!

[Page 40]
Doc. Enough.—Pardon my curiosity. It is intended for your good.
Ens. I believe you, but be silent, I conjure you. My bill is paid.
Doc. If a physician can be of any service to you, be assured I will zealously exert myself—
Ens. —(Deeply affected.) —Alas! The day is, perhaps, not far distant, when I shall be obliged to avail myself of your kindness.
Enter Baron, Sophia , and Mrs. Lenton . Bar. Ha! There he is.— (To Ens.) —Welcome, my [425]   friend. Doctor, I have had a very pleasant nap. It is long since I felt so well.
Doc. That is the effect of exercise. You must take an airing every day.
Ens. —(Aside.) —Can it be he?—The doctor is his friend—
Bar. So thoughtful, Mr. Vizar.
Ens. —(Keenly surveying him.] —I am incessantly endeavouring to discover my benefactor.
Bar. —(Aside.) —I see his aim.— (Aloud.) —I insist upon it he is a fool—so pray let him remain incog .—To be sure, his folly has been of some service to you.
Ens. My lord, I beg—
Bar. What does the blockhead mean? If he be thoroughly acquainted with your heart and sentiments, why does he deprive himself of a happy moment?—Either because he is not rich enough, in which case he should have kept his money —or because he is rich, in which case what he has done for you is a paltry trifle, and a certain proof that he will do no more.

[Page 41]
Ens. Happy am I in not having sufficient penetration to discover the validity of these conclusions.
Bar. But if he be not thoroughly convinced of the goodness of your heart—if he be not positive that your debts have been incurred by no misconduct on your part, and that [450]   your wants are occasioned by no extravagance,—then he is a madman, who throws his money away, and assists the wicked as well as the worthy.
Ens. —(Aside.) —Could I suspect such a man?
Doc. —(Apart to Bar.) —A very pretty description of yourself, my lord.
Sop. —(Apart to Len.) —It grieves me to hear my father talk thus.
Ens. —(Aside.) —A man like this wants a physician for his soul. To instil humane principles into his mind would be a master-piece of art.
Bar. Now to another subject.— (To Sop. and Len.) — Leave us together.— (Exeunt Sop. and Len.) —My dear Mr. Vizar, you perceive that I am not one of those tender-hearted beings, who from pure charity, throw their property away, but—what was I going to say?— (Apart to Doc.) —The deuce take it! I don't like to make him an offer of the girl.
Doc. —(Apart to Bar.) —Defer it till another opportunity occurs.
Bar. —(Apart to Doc.) —No. I owe him satisfaction for my shameful suspicion—and that on the spot.
Doc. —(Apart to Bar.) —But I have learnt—
Bar. Silence!—Mr. Vizar—what was I going to say?
Doc. —(Aside.) —It is as well. We shall so much the [475]   sooner come to an explanation.
Bar. —(Aside.) —The devil take it! To offer her myself—

[Page 42]
Ens. You seem uneasy, my lord.
Bar. Yes—because—what was I going to say?—True— Mr. Vizar, why don't you try to improve your situation by a good match.
Ens. Match!—I marry, who can scarcely maintain myself!
Bar. I said a good match, and therefore meant you should marry a woman of fortune.
Ens. A woman of fortune accept me!
Bar. Well, why not?—There are plenty of fools in the world.
Ens. My lord!
Bar. You find there is one fool, who gives you money without chusing to be thanked for it. Why may not another be found, who is silly enough to bestow his daughter or niece upon you with a good portion?— (Aside.) —Surely he can understand that.
Ens. —(Astonished.) —My lord—
Bar. You might then quit the service, and no longer care for the hatred of the general.
Ens. —(Aside.) —I know not what to think.
Bar. —(Apart to Doc.) —I can't speak more plainly.
Doc. —(Aside.) —How will this end?
Bar. Well, Mr. Vizar, you return no answer?
Ens. [500]   What can I answer to the enchanting vision? Granting that there really existed so generous a man—could I make the first proposal to him, without incurring a suspicion of the meanest avarice?
Bar. —(Incensed.) —But methinks you require a great deal, if you expect him to offer you his daughter or niece—
Doc. For the father might conclude from your reserve that your affections were previously engaged.

[Page 43]
Ens. How false would this conclusion be!
Bar. Your affections are totally disengaged then?
Ens. —(Seizing his hand.) —No, my lord. They have long been bestowed upon the daughter of the most generous man in the world.
Bar. You don't suppose that I am that man?
Ens. —(Releases his hand.) —If you be not—
                                         [Turns away. Bar. I am, my dear boy, I am. My girl is your's.— Hey! Sophia! Sophia!
Ens. Am I awake?— (Transported.) —Sophia mine!
Bar. She is, my boy! Sophia!
                                         [Ens. stands rooted to the spot in speechless extasy. Enter Sophia and Mrs. Lenton . Bar. Daughter, prepare to be married.
Sop. —(Joyfully.) —Married!
Bar. Yes. The bridegroom will soon be here.
Sop. —(Dejected.) —Soon be here!
Bar. Yes, the Count.
Sop. —(Shrieking.) [525]   —The Count!
Bar. Yes. What's the matter?
Sop. Oh dear father, he'll kill me by asking questions.
Bar. But suppose it were the Ensign—
Sop. The Ensign!
Bar. I suppose you would kill him by asking questions.
Sop. Your will is my law.
Bar. —(Leads her into his arms.) —There! Take him.
Ens. My lord—Sophia—is this a dream?——I am the happiest of mankind.—Oh, my lord—your daughter—I a beggar——Great God of Heaven!—What will she say to this?—I must—I must see her.—My father—my dear Sophia——I'll return in a few minutes.
                                         [Rushes out.
[Page 44]
Bar. What nonsense the man talks! What did he mean?
Sop. To leave me so immediately—
Len. He mentioned some other woman.
Bar. Hem! Joy has robbed him of his reason.
Doc. —(Apart to Bar.) —His conduct is in every respect to me unaccountable. I have, however, made a discovery—
Bar. —(Apart to Doc.) —Well?
Doc. —(Apart to Bar.) —Not in the presence of your daughter. Come with me into the next room.
Bar. I will.
                                         [Exeunt Bar. and Doc. Sop. Do you understand this, dear Mrs. Lenton?
Len. Almost.
Sop. [550]   Explain—
Len. I don't wish to awake you from the pleasing delusion.
Sop. You think, then, that he does not love me.
Len. He certainly does love you.
Sop. Well, that is all I can wish.
Len. But does he love you alone?
Sop. How can he love two at the same time?
Len. Oh, a young man's heart has room enough for more than two.
Sop. But he seemed in such raptures—
Len. Because he loves you. He instantly again became uneasy, because he remembered that he was bound by priorities. What else could he mean by his exclamation of “Great God of Heaven, what will she say to this?”
Sop. Oh that my father had allowed me to remain among the honest peasants!
Len. Even among them there are girls, who love sooner than they ought, and youths, who think more than one girl pretty. You should have waited 'till your father authorized you to love him.

[Page 45]
Sop. Did I love him by my own inclination? No. I felt compelled—irresistibly compelled. Ask my poor heart, and let it answer you.——I'll go into the garden.—Oh those unfortunate secret visits!
                                         [Exit. Len. Good Sophia, if such a discovery must be made, it [575]   is better before than after marriage.
                                         [Exit.

END OF ACT II.

[Page 46]
ACT. III. Scene Scene.—The same Room as in the first Act.—Enter Baron and Doctor . Bar. Taking it in the worst point of view, he can but have a dulcinea, who has been assisting in the consumption of his slender means—and do you think he cannot easily leave her for the sake of Sophia—and leave her with honour too?
Doc. I perfectly remember his expression. “If I have relations,” said he, “I may, perhaps, alleviate the sorrows of one far dearer to me than my own existence.” This is not the style in which a man speaks of a person whom he can easily forsake.
Bar. Hem! Hem!
Doc. Shall I discover to you my conjecture?
Bar. Well?
Doc. I fear the poor fellow is privately and unfortunately married.
Bar. Married! And allowed me absolutely to offer him Sophia—and accepted her too!—By Almighty God, if such be the case, his blood shall pay for his audacity.
Doc. Again incensed! Consider that your health—
Bar. Then why do you mention such things? You know that I have been a soldier, and shall not bear an insult from any man.

[Page 47]
Enter Sophia . Sop. Father, a servant has just brought this note for the Ensign.
Bar. [25]   What is that to me?
Sop. —(Aside.) —I thought he would have allowed me to open it?
Bar. Do you feel an affection for the Ensign, Sophia?
Sop. Dear father!
Bar. Answer me.
Sop. As you have resolved that he shall be my husband, he is dearer to me than any one.
Bar. But suppose I were to resolve otherwise—
Sop. Why so? This note—
Bar. You would like to read—eh?
Sop. It might explain the mystery.
Bar. Base, mean, boorish idea!— (Sop. turns away, and weeps.) —I believe the girl is in tears.—What's the matter?
Sop. Oh my father, why do you so often apply these epithets to me? Why did you discard me from your house, and suffer me to reside among peasants for nine years?
Bar. —(Aside.) —Thus it is. Good actions are always misunderstood.
Sop. I never knew my mother—and daily lose a portion of my father's affection.
Bar. Who told you so?
Sop. Your own expressions betray it.
Bar. Be easy my girl. I will not apply those epithets to you again.
Sop. —(Kisses his hand.) [50]   —Dearest father!

[Page 48]
Doc. Was not the servant known by his livery?
Sop. No. I have already enquired.
Doc. My lord, are you acquainted with the rank of the Ensign's family? I forgot to ask in the morning.
Bar. Yes. He is of a good family, and lost his parents at so early an age that he can scarcely recollect them. A distant relation took compassion on him (for he had nothing in the world) and enlisted him into our service when only ten years of age. This relation died, and the poor fellow,—after having been twelve years in the army, after having in the last war distinguished himself on several occasions, has at length attained the rank of an ensign.
Sop. —(Who has, in the mean time, examined the note on both sides.) —Oh dear father, forgive me—for Heaven's sake forgive me.
Bar. What now?
Sop. The note—
Bar. Well.
Sop. Has burst open—I don't know how.
Bar. Damnation!
Sop. It is really not my fault,—nor will I read it.— There, Doctor!
                                         [Gives him the note and exit. Bar. What a cursed accident!
Doc. My lord, with the firm conviction that you think me an honest man, I advise you to read this note.
Bar. [75]   No, doctor,—that would be shameful.
Doc. I am not of your opinion. Neither you nor I have opened it, and as it may, in all probability, explain—
Bar. I don't like any thing to be explained in such a way.
Doc. But—
Bar. No, doctor. I will not.
Doc. Consider only—

[Page 49]
Bar. If you cannot subdue your curiosity,—why read it, and I will not betray you. This is more than a man of honour ought to do,——but not a word will I know of it.
Doc. —(After having perused the note.) —Allow me to read it to you, my lord.
Bar. I will not, I say.
Doc. It relates to—
Bar. I am deaf.
Doc. The happiness of your daughter, perhaps, depends upon it.
Bar. —(Starts.) —Indeed!—Doctor, will you compel me to be guilty of a mean action?
Doc. Be mine the guilt—and mine the consequences.
Bar. Pshaw!
Doc. You must hear it, unless the welfare of your child be a matter of indifference to you.
Bar. Well, then—the devil take the note—read it
Doc. —(Reads.) [100]   —“What is the reason, my dear sir, that I have not seen you this week? My children lament your absence every minute. Your Charlotte will not listen to any one who attempts to console her, and Henry declares he will not speak a word of French till he sees you. At all events, let us hear some account of you, and believe me your faithful friend, Ann B—.”
Bar. “Your Charlotte will not listen to any one, who attempts to console her.” Hell and furies! Enter Sophia . What do you want?
Sop. Oh Heavens, the Ensign is just arrived. He seemed bereft of reason—seized my hand, and cried in a frightful voice: “Angel, angel, I may not possess thee. A curse
[Page 50]
divides us,” and immediately rushed towards his own room.
Bar. —(Takes the note from the Doc. and gives it to Sop.) —Read that.
                                         [Sop. peruses it. Doc. Shall I go and speak to him?
Bar. No. That is my office.
Doc. But, my lord—
Bar. Do you think I am a man?
Doc. Undoubtedly.
Bar. That I know how one man ought to act towards another?
Doc. In the state—
Bar. Leave me.
Doc. I dare not.
Bar. [125]   Leave me, I say, unless you wish me to ruin every thing.
Doc. Would you—
Bar. I would be alone with him. If he have any secret, he will entrust it to one person rather than two. I am most concerned in his fate, and what I cannot learn nobody can.
Doc. —(In a tone of intreaty.) —My lord—
Bar. I did not entrust you with my confidence that you might act in opposition to my wishes.
Doc. —(Hurt.) —As your lordship pleases.
                                         [Exit. Bar. —(Rings.) — Enter Mrs. Lenton . Request the Ensign to come hither.
                                         [Exit Mrs. Len. Sop. —(Returning the note.) —Dear father, I no longer wish to be married.
Bar. Go.
Sop. The doctor has expressly forbidden that you should be left alone.

[Page 51]
Bar. I am not absent, now. I am master of my own ideas.—Go, I tell you.
                                         [Exit Sop. [Bar. walks to and fro, in sullen meditation—becomes absent —and at once forgets every thing which relates to the Ens. While endeavouring to recollect the subject, he passes from one idea to another, 'till he finds the note, remembers the cause of his vexation, and walks furiously up and down. Enter Ensign .                                          [Ens. falls at the Baron's feet. Bar. What do you mean?
Ens. On my knees I thank you for the inestimable present, which you would have bestowed upon me.
Bar. Rise. An officer never ought to kneel.
Ens. It is not as an officer but as a man that I return [150]   thanks to the most generous of my fellow-creatures.
Bar. You mean to marry Sophia, then?
Ens. Almighty God! Is there any hapless being, whose fate can be compared with mine?
Bar. —(Violently.) —Well?
Ens. If in the public streets you meet a wretch who with forlorn distracted looks implores your charity, depend upon it he is happier far than I am.
Bar. Answer me plainly.—Will you marry Sophia?
Ens. I cannot—I may not.
Bar. Damnation! And accepted my offer?
Ens. Could I then believe—could I suppose—If you feel injured, my misery will afford you ample measure of revenge.
Bar. Here is an open letter, but damned be you or any one, who thinks me capable of doing such a thing. Sophia opened it by accident.— (Ens. looks at the signature, and puts the letter in his pocket.) —So indifferent?

[Page 52]
Ens. Why should I not be so on the most insignificant subject in the world?
Bar. To me it is not insignificant. That creature is the cause of the insult offered to me.
Ens. —(Astonished.) —What creature?
Bar. Your Charlotte, who refuses all consolation in your absence.
Ens. Now, by Heaven, this suspicion alone was wanting [175]   to complete my misery. Have you not often been in Brenner's house?
Bar. I have.
Ens. And have forgotten that he has two children called Charlotte and Henry.
Bar. No. I remember that perfectly.
Ens. Well then.— (With great violence of tone and gesture.) —That I might not be guilty of a dishonourable action —that I might not impose upon those who gave me credit —that I might live honestly—I instructed these children — (With the utmost fury) —for money,—under a solemn promise of secrecy. I am an officer, and well you know what disgrace would attach to me, were such a circumstance discovered. —To instruct my fellow-creatures is thought beneath my situation, but to borrow money of my comrades— to insult and even call them to account when they again demand it—would not be thought so mighty a disgrace.
Bar. To the point. You cannot marry Sophia?
Ens. Oh that I could! Angels should envy my bliss.
Bar. You are already married, then?
Ens. I!
Bar. And disgracefully married, or you would not make the alliance such a secret.
Ens. My lord, what can you mean? Could I, if married, have accepted the hand of your daughter?

[Page 53]
Bar. [200]   Yes—for you, probably, hoped to satisfy your wife, by settling a part of my property upon her.
Ens. —(Incensed.) —My lord!— (Checking himself.) —By what shall I swear that your suspicions are groundless? You doubt my honour. He who has no honour can have as little religion,—to swear, therefore, is needless.
Bar. I do not wish you to swear. I require a substantial reason for the alteration of your sentiments. If you refuse to give it, I think myself insulted.
Ens. By the Almighty I do not know the reason.—Be patient for a few days and the dreadful mystery shall be revealed, or I will sink beneath the pressure of it.
Bar. Were my knowledge of mankind smaller, the fellow would make me believe he was an honest man.
Ens. Fellow!—Moderate your language, or—
Bar. Moderate my language after such an insult! Your affection for my daughter was evident.—My well-meaning folly induced me to offer her to you.—You accepted my offer with every appearance of rapture, and now—
Ens. You would pity me if you knew the cause.
Bar. In heaven or on earth there is no cause which can justify such conduct.
Ens. Do you know what an oath is?
Bar. Nothing from your lips.
Ens. —(Aside.) —Grant me patience, Heaven!
Bar. [225]   I now plainly perceive that my reason is sometimes disordered.—I wished to bestow my daughter on a man, who is not ashamed of being indebted to the meanest tradesman, and yet from a point of honour refuses to address his General with common civility, when he thereby would gain the means of living creditably.— (Ens. attempts to go.—Bar. intercepts him.) —You, sir, have dared to insult a veteran, who had seen service before you had cut a tooth—
Ens. For the last time—don't forget that I am an officer.

[Page 54]
Bar. You are a villain—not an officer.
Ens. —(Furiously draws his sword.) —Damnation!—— Wretch, give me satisfaction, or—
Bar. By Hell, thou shalt have satisfaction.
                                         [Runs into the adjoining room. Ens. —(After a pause throws his sword aside.) —Heavens! —What have I done?———Could I forget, for whose sake my life must be preserved?—Oh that I at least—yes ——I can, I can.—My death shall procure her relief.
[Seats himself at the table and writes—then again takes his sword.] Enter Baron in a French uniform with a drawn sword in his hand. Bar. Here I am, stripling, and by the God who made us, thou shalt never again in this world demand satisfaction of an old soldier.
Ens. Use no more insulting terms. Our swords and not our words must now decide between us. But if the smallest emotion of pity remain in your breast, grant me one petition—
Bar. Defend thyself, or—
Ens. By all my hopes of mercy in another world, I will, [250]   but not till you have acceded to my request.
                                         [Lays his sword on the table. Bar. What canst thou have to request of me?
Ens. You are rich. On my existence depends that of an unfortunate female, who without my support must perish.— Put your name to this obligation, and if I fall, deliver it according to this address.
Bar. —(Enraged beyond all bounds.) —Dost thou think me foolish enough to support thy creature?

[Page 55]
Ens. The obligation shall remain in your hands. If you do not find the person worthy of the deepest compassion, tear it.
Bar. Ha! I perceive thy intentions.—Defend thyself—
Ens. Not 'till you have signed this paper.—Murder me, if you please.———
Bar. Thy wish is to make me calm, but thou shalt not succeed, by Heaven.—I'll sign the paper.
                                         [Signs it. Ens. Here is the address. Put it in your pocket.
Bar. —(Reads it.) —“Mrs. Hilberg, No. 2, High-street, on the fourth floor.”
Ens. Promise to assist her if I fall.
Bar. —(Thoughtfully surveying the address.) —I do promise.
Ens. God be witness of this promise, and punish you if you swerve from it!
Bar. —(Still looking at the address.) —Why, this is quite in the neighbourhood.
Ens. —(Takes his sword.) [275]   —Now to the purpose!
Bar. Will she explain every thing to me?
Ens. She will.—Now old soldier, teach me to demand satisfaction.
Bar. First a word—
Ens. Not another syllable.
Bar. Why may not she now explain—
Ens. Villain!—Meet me.
Bar. Death and damnation!— (Rushes furiously against the Ens. who parries the thrust, and instantly returns it. Bar. retreats a few steps.) —What means this?
Ens. Well, old soldier, come on.
Bar. —(Throws his sword away.) —Young man, would you make me an assassin?
Ens. Take up thy sword, coward.

[Page 56]
Bar. In return for my regard would you make me an assassin?
Ens. Didst thou not hear? I called thee a coward.
Bar. Call me what you please. You shall not exasperate me. My delirium is at an end, and your's will soon subside. —Be my son. Disclose to me the cause of your sorrow. — (Ens. throws his sword away. —You shall be my son without marrying Sophia. I will do for you what a stranger once did for me.—Forgive my warmth. You know my state of mind at intervals. Disclose to me what is the cause of your affliction.
Ens. I cannot. I am bound to secresy by an oath.
Bar. You have already broken it; for I know where to [300]   find the person, who can give me every explanation.
Ens. For Heaven's sake return the paper to me.
Bar. No. By my soul I'll see you happy.
Ens. Happy!
Bar. As hapy, at least, as I can make you. Disclose to me your secret. Call me your father. Sweeten an old man's life, which has been embittered by a single act of frailty.
Ens. —(Seizes his hand.) —Yes, my father, you shall know all. I accept your generous offer of parental love, and gratefully will I exercise every filial duty towards you. Had no one been dependant upon my existence, I would have refused this offer; for, without Sophia, death alone is welcome to me.
Bar. Speak, speak. She may, perhaps, still be your's.
Ens. Impossible! The most dreadful curse divides me from her.
Bar. Whose curse?
Ens. She, on whose account you accused me of an intrigue —she, for whose sake I involved myself in debt—she for whose subsistence I educated Brenner's children,—she,
[Page 57]
for whose recovery, I bought medicines upon credit—is my mother—and her curse for ever separates me from Sophia.
Bar. —(Looks at the address.) —Mrs. Hilberg.
Ens. That is an assumed name.
Bar. And you would have died to make her happy?— [325]   Wicked, wicked man, you would have made me a murderer —you would have increased my guilt, and multiplied my sufferings even while I stand upon the brink of the grave.
Ens. My father!
Bar. God forgive you! Such are the consequences of what is called a point of honour. Long ago might you have shared my fortune, or—impossible—are you ashamed of your mother?
Ens. Listen to the story of my life. My father died before my birth, and as long as I can remember, my mother supported herself and me by her labour. A poor old officer, who lived in the same house was our only friend. To him I was obliged for my early introduction into the army. Soon after his death, the regiment to which I belonged, was removed from one place to another. My mother, perceiving how impossible it was to support us both reputably, demanded of me an oath that I would never call her my mother. She assumed the name of Hilberg, and accompanied me from garrison to garrison, 'till at length we were compelled to part. She was ill when I left her—and I found her ill when I returned. The little money I had saved, enabled me to bring her hither two years since, and from that time to this she has seldom left her bed. I became acquainted with you at Brenner's, and by a lucky accident was admitted [350]   into your house as a lodger. I loved Sophia when I first beheld her, but never dared to hope for your consent to our union.— (With increasing energy.) —You to-day surprised me with it, and saw my transports. I flew to my mother,
[Page 58]
and related the joyful tidings. She instantly swooned, and as soon as she recovered, forbad me as I feared the most horrible of all curses, to think of marrying Sophia. I was in despair—I fell at her feet, and intreated her to declare the cause. Her reply was that I should learn it after her death, and thank her.
Bar. —(In deep meditation.) —A curse—without alledging any reason for it!—It must arise from her hatred against me on account of my supposed want of feeling.
Ens. Heavens! What a wretch am I!—On one side a mother on her death-bed—on another a girl, who loves me most sincerely.—There a maternal curse which for ever divides us—here a worthy man, who wishes to dry my tears, but may not.
Bar. Come—I'll see your mother.
Ens. No, no.—The sight of a stranger would agitate her too much, and my oath—
Bar. Go, then, and tell her you have broken it—honourably broken it.—Dwell upon an explanation of her opposition to the match. Tell her you are my son even if you do not marry Sophia. Tell her that if she dislikes me for [375]   my supposed want of feeling, many a person will hereafter witness that for many years charity has been my sole employment.
Ens. —(Returns his sword into the scabbard.) —I go, and will use every endeavour to obtain an explanation of this cruel secret.——Oh thou, who dost delight in rewarding filial affection, look down compassionately upon me. In this world there is for me but one recompence—Sophia.
                                         [Exit. Bar. —(Walks to and fro in gloomy reflection.) —Despised and hated because I no longer chuse to be imposed upon and robbed! 'Tis well.—I'll throw away the mask, appear what I am, and be again reduced to beggary.——Thou
[Page 59]
noble boy! Thou pattern of filial affection!——A grateful child is Heaven's best reward on earth.—Even I perhaps —villain that I am—but I have children, who will love and revere me. I am happier than I deserve to be.
Enter Mrs. Lenton . Len. Already alone, my lord!
                                         [Starts on perceiving his uniform. Bar. Come hither. Tell me sincerely what the world says of me.
Len. Every thing that is good.
Bar. That is not true.
Len. My lord!
Bar. Speak the truth, if you have any regard for me— or for yourself.
Len. To speak the truth is a bold attempt.
Bar. Not on this occasion. Is it not said that I am a severe [400]   and cruel man?
Len. Since you command me to speak the truth—it is, my lord.
Bar. The assertion is false. I only appear to be so.
Len. But you have appeared so for eight years.
Bar. Because I was, eight years ago, most shamefully imposed upon.—Am I not thought covetous?
Len. Yes, my lord.
Bar. My book can prove that to be false.
Len. —(Aside.) —But no fellow-creature can, I dare say.
Bar. I am said to be unjust too?
Len. That I never heard.
Bar. So much the better. But the world asserts that I am incapable of pity, and that no one is relieved by me?
Len. Yes, my lord.
Bar. It is not true. It is said, too, that I am sometimes absent and half-deranged—that I do strange things?

[Page 60]
Len. Yes, my lord.
Bar. This may be true, but I never do any thing, which can injure another.
Len. My lord, if I durst—
Bar. What!
Len. I would remind you of——the uniform—
Bar. You are right. I'll take it off again.—Yes—I put it on in an absent fit.
Len. [425]   And that drawn sword—
Bar. Was thrown there in an absent fit.
Len. Shall I go for your bedgown?
Bar. No. You might, perhaps, be overtaken by one of my fits, and become incapable of finding it.
                                         [Takes the sword and exit. Len. To act such a part for eight years!—I never saw him so cheerful in my life. Heaven grant that all may end well!
Enter Sophia . Sop. Has the Ensign been long gone?
Len. About a quarter of an hour.
Sop. Dear Mrs. Lenton—have you not learnt—
Len. What?
Sop. My father's——sentiments towards him?
Len. I believe they are very favourable.
Sop. —(Delighted.) —What makes you think so?
Len. Because it is long since I saw his lordship so cheerful.
Sop. Indeed!
Len. The mysterious connection may, perhaps, not be so dangerous as we imagined.
Sop. That I believe.
Len. To be sure the Ensign never can be your's.
Sop. You are very spiteful, Mrs. Lenton.

[Page 61]
Len. How so?
Sop. You raise my hopes only to depress them.—I will soon learn all that I have to fear
Enter Doctor . Doc. [450]   Your humble servant. Where is the Baron?
Len. In the next room.
Doc. Is he tolerably composed?
Len. Heaven knows what his ideas have been; but when I entered this room just now I found him dressed in his old uniform.
Doc. Uniform!
Len. Yes—and a drawn sword was lying on the floor. He has probably been explaining a manœuvre to the Ensign.
Doc. —(Alarmed.) —How!— (Going.) —I must see him.
Len. Here he comes.
Enter Baron . Bar. Ha! Doctor!
Doc. I hope your lordship feels well.
Bar. Far better than usual.
Doc. —(Apart to him.) —How did your conversation with the Ensign end?
Bar. —(Apart to Doc.) —In the strangest way you can imagine.
Enter Count . Cou. Your most obedient servant.
Bar. —(Aside.) —Why does he come to plague me just at this time?— (Aloud.) —Your servant, Count.
Cou. May I ask how you do, my lord?

[Page 62]
Bar. Very well, I thank you.
Cou. Is the Ensign within?
Sop. No.
Cou. [475]   What a pity! I wished to communicate some most welcome news to him.
Bar. Indeed!
Cou. Do you know who is his secret benefactor?
Bar. No.
Cou. So the Doctor is silent towards you as well as the rest of the world?—Doctor, never talk to me again about relations in Sweden.
Doc. Have you gained better information?
Cou. Yes. I know the benefactor and his agent. The latter—you are.
Bar. And who is the benefactor?
Cou. Count Wildner.
Bar. Indeed!
Cou. Most certainly.
Bar. You must have been very sly, or you could not have discovered this.
Cou. No slyness was necessary.
Doc. That I believe. Such things are generally learnt by accident.
Cou. Right, doctor. You know, my lord, that when I left you, I went to the General's house?
Bar. You know, my lord, that I dislike questions.
Cou. I did not observe that to-day.—Well—a large party was assembled, and I observed Count Wildner in close conversation [500]   with the general.—I approached—perceived that the Ensign was the person of whom they were speaking— and joined them.—Upon my honour, no father could exert himself more in behalf of his son than the Count in behalf of the Ensign.—I supported his request, and in short the general engaged that he should have the vacant lieutenancy.

[Page 63]
Bar. And from this you conclude that Wildner is the unknown benefactor.
Cou. In part, but I have another proof, which is far more substantial. After talking of various matters, I related the circumstance of the hundred Louis d'ors. The Count seemed to be confused, and asked if the Ensign was in such bad circumstances.—You are his unknown benefactor, said I.—He blushed beyond all measure, and thus betrayed the secret.
Bar. Betrayed it by blushing.
Cou. Yes—by his manner of blushing.
Bar. This reminds me of an anecdote, which I once heard.—A young man was accused of theft, and brought before a tribunal of justice. He steadfastly denied the fact, and sufficient evidence could not be produced against him. The president of this tribunal, at length, said to his associates, “Gentlemen, leave the matter to me. I'll soon convict this offender.—Hark ye, young man,” called he, in a loud voice, that he might alarm the prisoner,—“it is in [525]   vain to deny the fact. Your accomplices are secured, and have confessed that this is not your only offence.—The robbery which you committed not twenty miles from this place.” —The prisoner started—“Secretary,” called the president, “insert in the book of arraigns that he blushes, and is therefore convicted.”—The prisoner replied:—“As I perceive that my denial is in vain I will confess still more. I am not only a thief, but a murderer.”—“There, gentlemen,” said the president, you perceive I have brought him to confession.” —The prisoner then turned to the other members of the court—“and if you please, gentlemen, I will confess who was my accomplice.”—“Who?”—“The president.” —Of course the president started and was alarmed.— “Secretary,” added the young man, “insert in the book of arraigns that the president blushes, and is therefore convicted.”
[Page 64]
——In a word, the prisoner was found to be innocent, and you, Count, must allow me to think a blush no proof.
Cou. A charming story, upon my honour. It will be of great service to me in many parties.— (Looks at his watch.) —The Ensign stays too long—I spend the evening at the minister's—Your most obedient.
                                         [Exit. Bar. He is merely gone to repeat my anecdote.
Doc. The Count is a singular character.
Bar. He is a man of the world—a species, which has no [550]   character whatever.
Doc. What say you to the Ensign's promotion?
Bar. I hope he will be able to refuse it.
Sop. Dear father, shall we remove into the country soon?
Bar. Why?
Sop. I am tired of town.
Bar. Sophia, you are deeply smitten.
Sop. I don't understand you.
Bar. I am sure you do.
Enter Ensign . Ens. —(Rushes into the Baron's arms.) —My father!
Bar. What now, my son?
Ens. Son! Will you never retract this title?
Bar. Never.
Ens. I have a sacred claim to it.
Bar. You shall always retain it.—But come to yourself.— You know now—
Ens. All, all.—But how shall I disclose it? If you again discard me—
Bar. As surely as I hope to die in peace, I will not discard you.
Ens. Cruel father!—Yet you could discard my mother.
Bar. —(Keenly surveying him.) —Your mother!

[Page 65]
Ens. You could make her the victim of poverty, misery and infamy.
Bar. —(Overpowered, and with tremulous utterance.) — [575]   Great God of Heaven!—Is Caroline still alive?
Ens. She is—and implores, through me, justice towards your son, as a recompense for the sufferings of two and twenty years.
Bar. —(Staggers towards a chair.) —Alive!
Doc. (Supports him and places him in the chair—then beckons to the Ens. as if intreating him to moderate his warmth.) —Dear sir—
Ens. —(In a violent tone.) —I cannot be your son, if my mother be not your wife.—Pay the debt which is due to us.
Doc. Compose yourself, I beg.
Bar. Doctor, is this a dream?
Ens. Cruel hard-hearted man, are you still irresolute?— Then listen to the words of my mother, and if your heart can even then withstand the impulse of nature—
Doc. —(Still assisting the Bar.) —I beseech you—
Ens. —(Draws two letters from his pocket, and reads one of them.) —“To prevent a dreadful union and to rescue my son from despair, I now send the letter which I did not intend to be delivered 'till after my death.”— (Opens the other letter and reads.) —“He who delivers this letter to you is your son—the son of your Caroline.—You know I am your wife.—Rescue my name from infamy, and acknowledge your son as your lawful heir.—Farewell—and if it be any consolation, know that in my last moments I pray for you, and that the remembrance of that affection which I once felt for you, subdues every other sensation. Farewell for ever.
[600]   Caroline von Harrwiz.”
Bar. —(Clasps the Ens. in his arms.) —My son! My dear son!——Where are my clothes?
Ens. You acknowledge us, then—

[Page 66]
Bar. My coat!—Conduct me to your mother—to my Caroline. She shall learn what I have suffered—be convinced —and pardon me.
Ens. You acknowledge us.—Oh my father!
Bar. My coat, I say!—I must see her.
Ens. Not now——her illness——
Doc. No, my lord, the shock might be fatal.
Bar. —(Sinks into a chair.) —Poor unhappy woman!
Doc. —(To Ens.) —Your violence might have killed the Baron. He was not irresolute, but overpowered.
Ens. I know not what I did.
Sop. —(Approaches the Ens. with averted face.) —You are my brother, then?
Ens. —(The same.) —Yes, dear sister.
Bar. Caroline alive!—Doctor, my head—
Doc. I rejoice that you bear it so well.
Sop. —(As above.) —I hope we shall be friends.
Ens. Affectionate as brother and sister can be.
Bar. So much joy at once!—I shall hardly survive it.
Doc. Say not so. You will live to be a comfort to your family—or the prayers and blessings of the poor whom you [625]   have cherished, cannot have ascended to the Almighty.
Sop. —(As above.) —Yes. My heart told me we were related to each other.
Ens. My heart too told me—
Bar. That she would be your wife—and so she shall this day se'nnight.
Sop. I marry my brother!
Ens. I my sister!
Bar. You are not my daughter, Sophia, but you soon shall be
Sop. —(Joyfully.) —I not your daughter!
Ens. Were you not married in France?
Bar. No, my son.

[Page 67]
Ens. My mother understood that such was the case.
Bar. I have always considered your mother as my lawful wife.—As I was travelling through Germany in search of her, I arrived at a village where a peasant's hut was in flames. I sprung from my carriage, assisted those who were employed in rescuing what could be rescued, and was fortunate enough to snatch a child from the flames. That child is Sophia, and while I held her in my arms, I fancied Heaven had bestowed the infant on me, that by fostering it, I might make some atonement for my perfidy. Her poor parents, who died soon after, were prevailed upon to tell her that I was her father, and had only placed her for a few [650]   years under their care. God be thanked for having inspired me with the idea! It has procured me a daughter-in-law, whom any father might wish for.
Sop. —(Gives her hand to the Ens.) —William!
Ens. Sophia!
Both. —(Fall together at the Baron's feet.) —Your blessing, my father!

Trad. It is, indeed, good Lydia. It feels as if a band of Hottentots were dancing in every toe.
Lydia. Poor father!
Trad. Kind Lydia!
Lydia. How I wish I could relieve you!
Trad. That very wish is a relief to me. You are the only being in this house who tends my fast declining health.
Lydia. Oh, no, Sir!
Trad. Yes, Lydia, I vow to Heaven you are my only comfort.
Lydia. You forget that you have sons.

[Page 2]
Trad. Rather say they forget they have a father. Eighteen years ago I, like a fool, murmured when Providence bestowed on me a daughter. Sons I would have —brisk, active lads. They, thought I, make their way better through the world. Yes, yes, they do make their way, and leave their poor old father in the lurch. There's Samuel—
Lydia. The multiplicity of his business—
Trad. Pshaw! Gratitude to his parents ought to be the first business of every child. Then there's Robert—
Lydia. —(With great sympathy.) [25]   —Well, dear Sir, Robert?
Trad. Your eye sparkles whenever I mention his name, Lydia. Why, yes, Robert is better than his brother.
Lydia. Oh, he loves you most sincerely.
Trad. Much of his love can I feel at the distance of a thousand miles. There is he traversing unknown seas, while the gout is traversing every limb of my frame.
Lydia. Indeed, Sir, he knows no sorrow but the recollection of that. He will now, perhaps, soon return. I look at the weathercock every morning; and if he should bring riches with him, if he should convert our poverty to comfort—This, Sir, a son may do, while a daughter must remain at home, and can shew her affection in nothing but nursing her sick father.
Trad. I value your attention to me more than if Robert were to bring me the riches of the Indies. Dear Lydia, when I read in your eyes how you sympathize in my distress, you know not how I feel. You often think your father is asleep, because his eyes are closed. No, Lydia, he is praying for you. But, as for your mother and Samuel—Well, well! if I have no cause to bless them as a husband and father, let me at least forgive them as a Christian.
Lydia. May I then beg your blessing?
                                         [Kneels.
[Page 3]
Trad. —(Laying his hand upon her.) [50]   —God bless you; and may he prolong my life till I have seen you comfortably settled!—God bless you!
Lydia. And my brother Robert?
Trad. Him too.
Lydia. And Samuel?
Trad. Hold, Lydia! You heard what I but just now said. He has the blessing of his mother.
Lydia. How unhappy is this disagreement in so small a family!
Trad. Who is the cause of it? Your mother. Is she not for ever tormenting me from morn to night? for ever reminding me of my unmerited bankruptcy? for ever sneering at my respectable descent, and pluming herself on German ancestry? Does she not starve me? Does she not squander the little money which these few houses still produce? Did you hear how I begged last night for a little Madeira, as prescribed by the physician? Your mother and Samuel went to the play, while I was obliged to sleep away my wishes.
Lydia. Dearest father, to-day you shall want nothing.
Trad. I thank you, Lydia. Oh that some honest man were as nearly acquainted with the goodness of your heart as I am, and would marry you! I would go, and dwell with you till death.— (Speaking in a lower voice, and pointing to the opposite door.) [75]   —The stranger seems to be pleased with you.
Lydia. —(Alarmed.) —With me!
Trad. I have more than once thought so. He is, to be sure, not very young; but he seems to be an upright man; and your affections are disengaged?
Lydia. —(Confused.) —They are, Sir.
Trad. What a provision would this be for your poor father! Well! let us leave it to time—Oh! Oh! Oh!— There it flies again from my foot to my knee.

[Page 4]
Lydia. It is, perhaps, caused by your talking so much.— (Looking at the newspaper.) —Shall I go on?
Trad. Do. I may, perhaps, be able to sleep a little.
Lydia. Will it not be better if we go into your own room? for in this there is always so much noise, both on our side, and the lodger's.
Trad. No, Lydia; I will stay here. I shall not be allowed a wink in my own room. Be the noise as great as it may, I can bear it. Any thing is better than the voice of a scolding wife.
Lydia. —(Reading.) —Paris, twenty-sixth of January.
Trad. Or—better still, Lydia. Will you play a tune, or sing a song?
Lydia. Most certainly.— (She seats herself at the harpsichord, and plays or sings till she sees her father is asleep; then rises.) —He sleeps. Now quick! Tom [100]   must have been waiting a long time for my signal.— (Goes to the window, and makes signs.) —He understands me.— (Returns, and takes a pair of gloves out of her work-bag.) —If my mother should surprise me—or that suspicious spy Samuel—or if my father should awake— (looking towards him) —Heavens! how confused should I be! Enter Tom . Hist! Hist! Softly! He is asleep.
Tom. You have kept me long, Miss.
Lydia. Well! well! you shall have a penny more for it. Now, take this pair of gloves.
Tom. To sell again?
Lydia. Yes.
Tom. What am I to ask for them?
Lydia. A crown is the very lowest price. I have been employed five nights in netting them.

[Page 5]
Tom. That makes no difference to the buyer. If he likes them, he'll never ask whether you worked five nights or five minutes at them.
Lydia. Don't talk so loud. You may wake my father.
Tom. Well! I'm going.
Lydia. Stop! I have something more to tell you. When you have sold the gloves, go to the tavern at the corner of the street, and buy a pint of Madeira.
Tom. Well?
Lydia. [125]   Then wait at the usual place for my signal.
Tom. I will.
Lydia. Go, then.
Tom. Your servant, Miss!
                                         [Exit. Lydia. Best of fathers! How limited are your desires! To my work again!— (Beginning to sew.) —How sweet it is to work for a parent! Enter Samuel , with Hat and Stick. Good morning, brother!
Sam. Good morning!— (Aside.) —Hem! Question: Is all safe?— (Feeling in his pockets.) —There is the key of the desk—there, of the closet—there, of the great trunk. Answer: All right.
                                         [Going. Lydia. I fear you have forgotten the principal key, brother.
Sam. Principal! Question: What can that be?
Lydia. The key of your heart, which you certainly have lost, and which I shrewdly suspect to be stolen by the little Indian girl who lodges here.
Sam. Don't be afraid of that. I own she did just gently open the door, for who, alas! can be, at all times, on his guard? But be assured, Lydia, I have, on this, as on all other occasions, taken the necessary precautions.

[Page 6]
Lydia. Precautions against love!—Pray let me hear what they are.
Sam. —(Significantly.) —You find the want of them— [150]   do you, Miss Lydia?
Lydia. —(Confused.) —I!
Sam. Yes, you. Do you think I never discovered that? The young fool of an East Indian, who is at sea with Robert, and whose history he so carefully conceals, has (between ourselves) taken my sister's heart upon the voyage with him.
Lydia. I thank you for the compliment, brother. You first call him a fool, and then suppose me to be in love with him.
Sam. Yes, yes. Love has bewildered you. My dear sister, when a person runs to the window about twenty times a-day to see how the wind blows—
Lydia. That I do for the sake of my brother Robert.
Sam. Robert has often been at sea before, but never did Miss Lydia grieve so much as when he last sailed. Moreover, when a person blushes at the bare mention of a certain name, when a person's pocket-book contains a certain miniature, I beg leave to ask: Is this love? Answer: Yes.
Lydia. And I beg leave to ask: When a person opens his sister's pocket-book without her leave, is he a mean dishonourable fellow? Answer: Yes.
Sam. What! in a pet! Is it my fault that other people are not so careful of their pocket-book as I of mine?
Enter Mrs. Tradely . Mrs. T. [175]   Très grand! Très noble! When dinner is ready, you swarm about it like wasps, but never think of coming near me in a morning.
Sam. The duties of my office have engaged me.

[Page 7]
Mrs. T. —(To Lydia.) —And you?
Lydia. I have been reading the newspaper to my father.
Mrs. T. But I have heard you prating together some time. What was the subject of your conversation?
Lydia. Oh, nothing of consequence. I was joking with my brother.
Sam. And I was talking very seriously to my sister.
Mrs. T. About whom, or what?
Lydia. About the wild girl who has lodged with us for the last four months.
Sam. About the wild lad who has been wandering with Robert (Heaven knows where) for the last twelve months.
Lydia. She has, in spite of his ever avowed caution, made a conquest of him.
Sam. He has, in spite of her never avowed giddiness, made a conquest of her.
Mrs. T. Why, surely the creatures have both lost their senses.
Sam. I am perfectly satisfied with mine.
Mrs. T. That is a certain sign they are gone. Man is [200]   never satisfied with any thing but his sense; and the less he has, the better satisfied is he. But, sans badinage , I hope neither of you is capable of seriously harbouring such groveling ideas; for, though, by your father's side, you are but of vulgar extraction, the blood of ancient noblesse flows in the veins of your mother.— (Looks at them as if in expectation of an answer. Lydia sews, and Samuel plays with the string of his cane. She raises her voice, and places her arms a-kimbo.) —How! What! Point de reponse ! Shall I then live to see my eldest son married to a vagabond?
Sam. Be cautious, honoured mamma, be cautious. Our lodger may overhear every word.

[Page 8]
Mrs. T. —(To Lydia.) —And you! Could you so far forget your Maker and your rank, as to bestow your hand upon a heathen, who is nobody into the bargain?
Lydia. —(In a tone of supplication.) —Speak lower, dearest mother. My father is asleep.
Mrs. T. What! Would the girl attempt to restrain my tongue? Asleep indeed!— (Turning to Tradely, and bawling still louder.) —He shall awake. He shall assist me in combating the follies of his children. Holla! Mr. Tradely, I say!
Trad. —(Starting from his sleep.) —O—h!
Mrs. T. What's the matter now?
Trad. My leg.
Mrs. T. Forget your leg. We are talking about things [225]   of far greater consequence to you.
Trad. I should like to know what can be of greater consequence to me than my own limbs.
Mrs. T. Ten thousand things. You ought to forget your leg.
Trad. —(Allowing her to be right.) —Very true. Oh! O—h!
Mrs. T. A gouty leg is good for nothing.
Trad. Nothing at all.
Mrs. T. Had you been blessed with a liberal education, you would have known that the ancient Stoics did not consider pain as any affliction.
Trad. The ancient Stoics never had the gout, then.
Mrs. T. Mr. Tradely, your illiterate vulgarity is unpardonable. You have been blessed with a wife of rank, and have consequently had many opportunities of improving yourself. How often have I repeated, and how often must I repeat to you, that nothing is so certain to make a healthy person feel the horrors of ennui , as to hear an invalid constantly complaining of his maladies?

[Page 9]
Trad. Well then, for Heaven's sake, talk of something else.
Mrs. T That I should have done long since, if you would have allowed me to speak. There stands your son, Mr. Samuel Tradely, and there your daughter, [250]   Miss Lydia Tradely.
Trad. I see them.
Mrs. T. They are both mad.
Trad. Both!
Mrs. T. This amiable youth wants to marry a runaway Indian wench.
Sam. To marry! Who said any such thing. To be sure, if the question were, Does the girl please me, the answer would certainly be, yes. But before I could determine on so momentous and awful a particular as matrimony, a hundred thousand circumstances must be considered, millions of obstacles must be removed, and an innumerable list of requisites must be adjusted.
Trad. Yes, my dear, you need not be afraid. Samuel will not be too hasty, I am sure.
Sam. No. Indeed I shall not.
Trad. But if in this case he should, it will be the first wise step he ever took in his life. The girl is bewitching. Her careless easy air must enchant every one.
Mrs. T. Très noble! A remark perfectly worthy of your low-born mercantile ideas. You seem, Mr. Tradely, as usual, to have forgotten the two most material points, the axis, upon which the whole moral world turns.
Trad. And those are—
Mrs. T. [275]   Birth and fortune.
Sam. Very true.
Trad. With regard to fortune, I must, to my sorrow, confess she is right.
Sam. Perfectly right.

[Page 10]
Trad. I, nevertheless, hope the girl will not be wanting in this respect. Her father lives privately, but well. He owes no one a farthing, and pays us our weekly rent at the very hour.
Lydia. He is very charitable, too.
Mrs. T. Mon dieu! Let us hear no more of your calculations, Mr. Tradely. You are ever reminding us you have been in trade—and have been it is indeed. Who in his senses ever reckoned regular payment a sign of wealth? The richest people are in debt to the whole world. But passe pour cela! If this be granted, the most essential point still remains undecided: or perhaps you think punctual payment a proof of an illustrious derivation too?
Trad. Not I, indeed; but I consider this point to be superfluous; and in the choice of a wife (I mean if I might chuse again) I should prefer a handsome good tempered girl to a hump-backed vixen with a dozen generations of ancestors.
Mrs. T. Mon fils! Have you a smelling bottle?
Sam. [300]   Oh, yes, honoured mamma!
                                         [Presents it. Mrs. T. Lydia, support me. I shall faint.
Trad. You need not take the trouble, my dear. I shall pay no regard to it.
Mrs. T. No wonder were it, if the spirits of my great forefathers hovered above me at this instant. “Such is her fate,” may they contemptuously exclaim, “who demeaned herself to be a merchant's wife. Such is her fate, for whose hand the nobles of the German empire sued, and who preferred to them a man sans education , sans savoir vivre, sans principes nobles , a bankrupt, a cripple, a beggar—
Trad. Lydia, help me to my chamber.
Mrs. T. What! Do you think I can't follow you? I'll be with you soon, I promise you.

[Page 11]
Trad. Then, Lydia, help me to my grave.
Mrs. T. But first a word or two with you, my son.                                          [Lydia pushes Tradely's chair off. True it is, Samuel, you have reached the age when you may think of matrimony.
Sam. And I do think of it.
Mrs. T. Yes, but you have been thinking for five years, and are advanced no further.
Sam. Caution is the mother of wisdom.
Mrs. T. Your caution is an ignis fatuus , which will lead you into a morass.
Sam. [325]   What a simile, honoured mamma! Can caution be an ignis fatuus? Answer: No. Is Gurli a morass! Answer: No. Rather may she be compared to a flower-garden, or a flowery meadow, or a floriferous lawn.
Mrs. T. Yes, but some flowers grow under hedges.
Sam. They are not on that account less fragrant.
Mrs. T. Fi done, mon fils! Do not thus disgrace my blood. A girl of no birth, an Indian, consequently a heathen, a giddy, light-headed creature, whose father is a dry old ape, known by nobody, and perhaps not worth a shilling!
Sam. As to her birth, you know, mother, we pay no great regard to that in England.
Mrs. T. Alas! no. A peer and a porter here enjoy equal privileges.
Sam. That she is a heathen—
Mrs. T. Well, well! That is not of such material consequence.
Sam. Giddy and light-headed? Answer: She is young. A steady man may convert her into a steady wife. Her father a dry old ape? To this I naturally answer: Mr. Samuel Tradely would marry the daughter, not the father. I can, therefore, have nothing to do with that. But the most essential point upon which my honoured mamma
[Page 12]
has touched is the fortune. In order to learn this, I [350]   have with proper caution and circumspection stationed spies at different posts.
Mrs. T. And were you to find her rich, could you be so ignoble as to form a resolution—?
Sam. Resolution! Hold, I beseech you, for you quite alarm me. I verily believe that if any one were, at this moment, to convince me that the girl was a princess, and her father worth whole tons of gold, I should, nevertheless, tremble at the bare idea of forming a resolution .
Mrs. T. You are a fool.
                                         [Exit. Sam. A fool! A fool!— (Walks to a looking-glass, and adjusts his cravet.) —Do I look like a fool? Answer: No.
Enter Gurli , in a careless English Dress. Her Hair flows rather wildly over her Shoulders. Gurli. —(Talking to some one as she enters.) —But I won't. Ha! Ha! Ha! How strange it is! The people never asked me, but have put a great round thing upon a tower, and when it grunts many times, Gurli must eat her breakfast; but Gurli is not hungry, and won't eat her breakfast.
Sam. —(Aside.) —Quite alone! What an admirable opportunity to sound her!—but with caution.— (Aloud.) —Beauteous Gurli, good morning to you!
Gurli. Good morning, silly man.
Sam. —(Starts.) —Silly man! What can she mean? Miss Gurli, give me leave to say you are rude.
Gurli. [375]   Oh! Don't mind that. Gurli means no harm; but she always laughs when she sees you.
Sam. Laugh at me! I must naturally ask why?

[Page 13]
Gurli. That I don't know myself. I think it is because you always look as if the welfare of Bengal rested on your shoulders; and are as long in stepping over a little ditch, as if it were the great Ganges.
Sam. I perceive that in the East Indies education is still very much neglected. Children talk of matters which they do not understand.
Gurli. But Gurli is not a child. She is soon to be married.
Sam. —(Alarmed.) —Married! Indeed!
Gurli. Yes. My father says so.
Sam. To whom?
Gurli. That I don't know.
Sam. Then your father has not fixed on any one?
Gurli. No. He says I am to fix on one myself.
Sam. Indeed! Is the choice left entirely to yourself? I could almost ask, beauteous Gurli, whether you have yet cast your eye upon any one?
Gurli. I often cast my eye here and there, but my heart moves no more than a bird in its nest.
Sam. Charming! Excellent! I could almost ask, most lovely Gurli, how you like me?
Gurli. [400]   You! I don't like you at all.
Sam. Not so hasty. Why need you tell a person to his face that you don't like him?
Gurli. Because you asked me.
Sam. I did, to be sure, but— (aside) —I think it will be right to advance a little—
Gurli. —(Yawning.) —Gurli has not slept enough—
Sam. —(Aside.) —But with caution, with caution.
Gurli. Or silly Samuel tires me.
Sam. —(Aside.) —How shall I begin, now?— (Aloud.) —Blessed, thrice blessed will be that man, whose happy lot it will be to pluck the sweetest flower which the odoriferous zephyrs ever opened from its bud.

[Page 14]
Gurli. —(Laughing.) —This is all Sanscrit to Gurli; and no one understands that, except our Bramins.
Sam. —(Peevishly.) —I spoke in the oriental style; but I perceive my language must be plain and simple.
Gurli. Yes. Gurli likes that best.
Sam. Pity it is that wisdom forbids such language.
Gurli. But wisdom does not forbid Gurli to run away when you tire her.
                                         [Going. Sam. Stay but one moment, beauteous Gurli. I would willingly speak plainly—express myself more plainly—address you in the plainest manner—did I but know whether your father—whether he stands in need of [425]   support.
Gurli. I don't understand you.
Sam. I mean—I only wish to imply that I would willingly render him any assistance—if he were unfortunate.
Gurli. —(With sudden gravity.) —Unfortunate!
Sam. —(Very inquisitively.) —Yes, unfortunate. I could almost ask whether it is so? Answer me?
Gurli. —(Weeping.) —Oh, yes! My poor father is unfortunate.
Sam. —(Aside.) —There we have it!
Gurli. And you would assist him? I must kiss you for that.
                                         [Kisses him. Sam. —(Much confused.) —Yes. I mean if it be in my power. It is right to assist a neighbour in distress; for no person can say how soon it may be his own lot to want it.
Gurli. Oh, you can't help him, and Gurli can't help him.
Sam. —(Aside.) —Thanks to caution! How nearly had I coupled myself with a beggar!— (Aloud.) —Yet I hope his circumstances are not in so desperate a state, but that he will be able to discharge the rent of his lodgings
[Page 15]
for the last week. Not on my own account—I would do any thing in my power for him—but my father is apt to be harsh on such occasions.
Gurli. The rent!
Sam. [450]   Yes, yes, the rent.
Gurli. Are you awake?
Sam. I believe so.
Gurli. Ha! Ha! Ha! I'll tell you what. If my father chose to do it, he could pay you the rent of his lodgings, and all the house, twenty times twenty times, foolish man.
                                         [Exit laughing. Sam. Quite a mystery, to be sure—but I will not relax my vigilance and caution. Foolish too! Twice today have I been called a fool, but both times by women. I therefore naturally ask: Ought a wise man to pay any attention thereto? No.
Enter Hurry . Hurry. Glad I've found you. Glad I've found you. I've run all the way as quick as thought.
Sam. Well, my dear Hurry, have you remembered my directions? Have you been sounding with the necessary care and caution?
Hurry. I have. I've been scampering swift as lightning into every street. I've dogged him as quick as thought into every corner, and have gathered not a little intelligence, I promise you.
Sam. In the first place, then, with regard to his rank?
Hurry. Of that I must own I can learn nothing. Not a soul knows one syllable respecting it. That he is an [475]   East Indian all agree, because he himself avows it; but whether from the coast of Malabar, or the coast of Coromandel, I have, in the utmost haste, not been able to
[Page 16]
learn. Thus much is certain, no vessel brought him hither; and it is the general opinion, that he came by land from Portsmouth.
Sam. In the next place with regard to his fortune?
Hurry. In that respect I shall have the honour as quick as thought to serve you with a clear and circumstantial account. Notwithstanding the humble clothing of this man, and of all his family; notwithstanding the solitary dish, which daily appears upon his table; notwithstanding the clear spring water, which is his only beverage, I pronounce him swift as lightning one of the richest inhabitants of this port.
Sam. I must now naturally ask why?
Hurry. Because he throws his money away as quick as thought.
Sam. How so?
Hurry. Allow me to relate the particulars without delay. Last week the house of Brown and Belton was on the point of stopping payment. It was generally rumoured upon 'Change, and, as usual on such occasions, one said he pitied them, another shrugged his shoulders, a third—
Sam. [500]   Well, well, to the point.
Hurry. Instantly Caberdar, whom I followed swift as lightning, went round, and made enquiries among the merchants. They told him that Brown and Belton were good honest people, who had been caught in a snare without deserving it. Quick as thought sits he down, and writes a note to Brown and Belton, containing these words: “If ten thousand pounds will save your credit, I will lend you this sum without interest for six months.” Brown and Belton, who never even saw the man, are astonished and transported, honour their drafts, transact their business swift as heretofore, and revere the East Indian as a saint.

[Page 17]
Sam. Heavens! what want of caution! He must have a son-in-law to manage his affairs; a careful, cautious, circumspect, considerate man. But proceed, my dear Hurry. You have, to be sure, proved that this Caberdar was once worth ten thousand pounds; but at the same time you have proved that he was so great a blockhead as to throw them away. The question therefore is—
Hurry. Whether he has enough left to deserve the attention of a steady man. In that respect I will as quick as thought have the honour to satisfy you. You know the fine estate called Glenmore Lodge, so capitally [525]   stocked with fish, flesh, fowl and fruit, and which also possesses the admirable qualification of being only half an hour's ride from the town. The young prodigal who lately succeeded to it, has been obliged to sell it, and swift as lightning has our East Indian bought it.
Sam. How! Are you sure of this?
Hurry. Ay, and quick as thought has he paid for it.
Sam. Hem! This deserves consideration. I must endeavour to gain further intelligence on the subject; and should the report prove true, Gurli will have a fortune which will cast a veil over her numerous imperfections. Upon 'Change I may hear more. Have you any thing further to communicate, Hurry?
Hurry. Nothing material. He speaks but little—he chews some Indian herb. He has so great a reverence for cows, that when he sees a herd of them, he bows thrice to the earth. He bathes daily. He distributes alms at new and full moon.
Sam. Yes, yes, he wants a son-in-low indeed. This mist of folly will then be dispersed by the sun of reason. I'll prove to him that a cow has no more right to be revered than an ass. I'll prove to him that neither at new nor at full moon does caution allow the distribution of
[Page 18]
alms. In short, if the purchase of Glenmore Lodge be true, my marriage with Gurli cannot be wrong. Meanwhile, [550]   my dear Hurry, farewell. Continue to be diligent, observant, unwearied, and, above all things, cautious. Let your five senses be ever on the watch. The gratitude of my disposition is known to you; and if it be at any time asked, whether I will with pleasure serve you in return, the answer will always be: Yes.
                                         [Exit. Hurry. And if it be at any time asked, whether I should like to kick you down stairs as quick as thought, the answer will always be: Yes. After all my trouble, to be fobbed off with a few empty words. But thus it is in this world. There is scarcely an honest man in service, that has not a person worse than himself above him. If it be a man's wish to eat his morsel of bread in peace, he must bow to empty heads, and swollen paunches, as Caberdar does to cows and oxen.— (Shrugging his shoulders.) —Well! He is my superior, and sometimes shuts an eye when I open a purse—so swift as lightning to serve him again!— (Creeps to Tradely's door, and puts his ear to the key-hole.) —I hear a noise at a distance.— (Pause.) —Ay, it is old Mrs. Tradely's eternal croak.— (Pause.) —Damn those canary birds! What a noise they make!—Quick! Quick!— (Runs to Caberdar's door.) —There all is as still as death.— (Pause.) —But no; Gurli is humming a tune.— (Pause.) —I dare say she sings very melodiously; but it will not [575]   satisfy my curiosity.— (Runs again to the opposite door.) —Here they are all as still as mice, for a wonder.— (Pause.) —Now Miss Lydia is beginning to talk.— (Pause.) —There again! The devil choke those canary birds! If a word be spoken, they are sure to— (Runs again to the other door, but scarcely has he placed his ear at the key-hole, when Ganem opens the door, and almost knocks him down.)

[Page 19]
Ganem. —(Always speaking with honest dryness.) —What is your will, good friend? Do you want me?
Hurry. Not exactly.
Ganem. Or my master?
Hurry. I can't say I do.
Ganem. Or the daughter of my master?
Hurry. Were I to say so, I should not speak the truth.
Ganem. Then must your visit have been intended to this wooden door, for in that room dwell only three persons—my master—the daughter of my master— and, I.
Hurry. —(Who recovers from his confusion by degrees.) —My real intention was, as quick as thought, to bid you good morning, and ask you how you do.
Ganem. Good morning.
Hurry. You are quite well, I hope?
Ganem. Quite well.
Hurry. In body and mind?
Ganem. In body and mind.
Hurry. Understand me properly, my worthy friend. A man may be in perfect health; but what, for instance, [600]   avails the wish for sleep, when cares for bare subsistence hang heavy on the soul? What avails the appetite of health, when there is no bread to satisfy it? But neither of these, I presume, is your case?
Ganem. Neither.
Hurry. You have more than you want?
Ganem. I have.
Hurry. Your master is very rich?
Ganem. Brama has been pleased to grant him much.
Hurry. —(Very inquisitively.) —Brama! Indeed! Pray, who is Mr. Brama? I never heard his name bofore. Is he so very generous?

[Page 20]
Ganem. To all good men, Brama is very generous.
Hurry. Indeed! Where does he live—that I may hasten quick as thought?
Ganem. He lives on the banks of the Ganges.
Hurry. That is at too great a distance. Your master is probably related to him.
Ganem. My master is sprung from his right shoulder.
Hurry. An odd relation, indeed!
Enter Caberdar . Cab. —(Somewhat harshly to Hurry.) —What do you want here?
Hurry. Nothing in the world, most honoured Sir. I was hastening past, and just stopped to enquire as quick as thought after Mr. Ganem's health.
Ganem. —(Very dryly.) [625]   —He placed his ear at the keyhole to enquire after my health.
Cab. Do you suspect me, or my daughter, or my friend Ganem, to be smugglers?
Hurry. Why, Sir, if you will not be offended, something very like it. Nobody knows who you are, what you are, where you are come from, and what you are come for. In short, you possess all the requisites of smugglers.
Cab. Were I in Spain, I might expect such language from a servant of the inquisition, but in England I know my privileges—Walk out!
Hurry. Walk out! By what right—?
Cab. I pay for these lodgings.
Hurry. Yes, but this room is common both to you and the family. I can come hither quick as thought whenever I please, to speak, answer, and relate, converse, consider, and debate, with my worthy comptroller Mr. Samuel Tradely, and no one shall hinder me—No—
[Page 21]
even if he be ten times as nearly related to old Brama as yourself.
Cab. If you do not intend that I should throw you out of the window, I advise you to go.
Hurry. —(Gradually retreating towards the door.) —What! Throw me out of the window! Me, the swiftest, alertest, quickest, and most expeditious man in the [650]   whole town! Me, who have devoted my life to the service of Old England, and am always promoting its interest as quick as thought! Throw such a man out of the window!
Cab. —(Looking at his watch.) —Yes, unless you disappear within three minutes.
Hurry. Zounds! That's as swift as lightning. I am sorry business requires my immediate departure, or we would have seen, great shoulder of Brama, whether—
(Caberdar runs towards him. He escapes, and exit.) Ganem. He, who was once ruler over thousands, that fruitful tree, beneath whose branches the princes of India reposed, alas, how is he fallen! A wretch like this dares to insult him. Oh, misery!
Cab. I feel not the insult, Ganem. Does anger seem to lower upon my brow?
Ganem. No, because anger without power would ill become thee. Thou art no longer Nabob of Mysore.
Cab. Still these lamentations! I own I am no longer Nabob of Mysore—nor do I wish to be so.
Ganem. Not wish it!
Cab. Tell me, my faithful friend, didst thou esteem me happy, when Englishmen and Frenchmen were courting my alliance, when I was involved against my inclination in their quarrels—when I served the one from choice, the other from constraint—when I, each moment,
[Page 22]
[675]   was in want of money to satisfy my murmuring troops—when the court of Delhi formed cabals against me, and I was compelled to stoop to little arts in order to support my dignity—when Europeans spread destruction through my realms—when, at last, my brothers revolted, and I, overpowered with cares, tossed on my couch so many a sleepless night? Tell me, was I then happy?
Ganem. No, but still the hope of future happiness consoled thee. What was lost thou mightst regain.
Cab. Can I not still?
Ganem. No. Unless Brama work a miracle, never wilt thou again be Nabob of Mysore.
Cab. Thinks Ganem, then, no joy is to be found upon this spacious earth, but the sceptre of Mysore?
Ganem. Canst thou reanimate the bodies of thy murdered wives and children?
Cab. Alas! No.
Ganem. Canst thou even find their bodies, that thou mayst sacrifice an heifer on their tombs?
Cab. Alas! No. Woe be on my brothers! Not a single son have they left me. All, all deprived of life, perhaps by cruel tortures! Away with the dreadful recollection! The sun of those days is set—here will I stand and wait its rising.
Ganem. [700]   For us it will never rise again.
Cab. Why not? If not on the banks of the Ganges, perhaps on the banks of the Thames. Much have I lost, yet much may still be gained. Content and peace were not among the blessings of Mysore. They are a treasure which the Gods have never yet bestowed upon the race of Raja. To you, sweet joys of mediocrity, I descend or ascend. I am not yet old. I may still have sons, the pleasure and the pride of my declining years. Faithful Ganem, I will chuse a wife, purchase more
[Page 23]
more estates with the treasures which I rescued, and willingly exchange the throne surrounded by ten thousand rebellious slaves for the peaceful society of a few friendly Europeans.
Ganem. Chuse a wife! Where wilt thou find in England a wife sprung from thy race?
Cab. Wretched prejudice! My native country has renounced me, and I am freed from all her customs. My eye has chosen, my heart has assented, and I wait but for the decision of my reason. Miss Lydia— (transported) —Her look is a sun-beam, through which the soul passes into paradise. The gentle wisdom of the Goddess Sawasuadi rests upon her lips; and virtue, sprung from the right breast of the God of Gods, is enthroned in her heart. Oh, Mamnadin, God of Love, take up thy [725]   abode there, too.
Ganem. Thou art in raptures. Beware! Thy heart is become a child, which will wantonly elude thy reason, while it creeps after thee in the form of a venerable sage.
Cab. Right, old man! I must not be too hasty. With thy unbiassed sight will I observe, with thy cool circumspection will I scrutinize; and if the event accord with my wishes, surely, surely thou wilt then think me happy.
Ganem. —(After a pause.) —No. Alas! there only, where the Ganges winds its course through fertile fields of rice, there only can happiness be found. Here, in a strange country, where I never meet a friend, to whom I can say, “Dost thou remember the happy days we spent together twenty years ago, at such a place?” here, where no one speaks my language, no one worships my Gods—Oh misery!
Cab. Ganem, thou dost hurt me much. Will the fountain of thy lamentations overflow for ever? Dost
[Page 24]
thou repent that thou hast shown such unusual fidelity? Dost thou repent that thou wert the only man who did not forsake his master, when desolating lightnings hissed around him?— (Seizes his hand.) —I never can repay thee for it. Affection can alone requite affection. In [750]   my heart only thou must look for thy reward.
Ganem. And have richly found it. Forgive my complaints. Till death I will remain with thee.
Cab. Hold! I hear Gurli.
Enter Gurli . Gurli. —(Yawning.) —Father, Gurli is tired.
Cab. Have I not shewn you various means to occupy your time? Sewing—netting—reading.
Gurli. Yes, father, and Gurli has tried them all, but Gurli is so stupid that she spoils every thing. When I sew, I either tear my thread, or break my needle; when I net, the meshes drop from my fingers; and when I read I fall asleep.
Cab. Then kill the time by talking.
Gurli. Talking! But I can't find any body to talk with. You are seldom at home—Ganem is dumb—the ugly old mother is always scolding—Samuel is silly; and Lydia—
Cab. —(Hastily interrupting her.) —Well! Lydia?
Gurli. Oh! I love Lydia as much as if she were my sister. She is a much better girl than Gurli. But she dare not talk much to Gurli.
Cab. Why not?
Gurli. Because her cross ugly old mother has forbidden it. But even if Gurli were to be all day with Lydia, Gurli would still want something.
Cab. [775]   What?
Gurli. Gurli does not know herself.
Cab. But describe it then.

[Page 25]
Gurli. Father, it can't be described. I have sometimes thought I wanted a parrot or a cat.
Cab. Why, you have both.
Gurli. Yes, Gurli has both; but sometimes I feel such anxiety that I take the parrot, and then the cat, and kiss them, and press them to my heart, and love them so dearly—yet still I always feel as if I wanted something. Father, you must buy Gurli another cat.
Cab. —(Smiling.) —Certainly.
Gurli. And yesterday, as I was walking in the little wood near the town, a bird sung so sweetly, so movingly! —Only think, father. Gurli could not refrain from tears. I felt so sad, so oppressed—I was continually looking round for something, till at last—I plucked a rose, and kissed it, and kissed it a thousand times, and bathed it with my tears. That was very odd—Was it not, father?
Cab. It was.
Gurli. Father, you must buy such a bird for Gurli.
Cab. Undoubtedly.
Gurli. Oh! Gurli does not know what she wants.
Cab. Be at ease. Your father has more experience, and understands what all this means. Now to another [800]   subject. Have you thought of what I lately mentioned.
Gurli. You know, father, I don't think much; but if you think it right, I'll marry.
Cab. Yes. Your father thinks it necessary that you should fix upon a husband, and the sooner, the better. Have you as yet seen nobody, whom you particularly like?
Gurli. No. There's Samuel. He talks a great deal of love, but his love does not please Gurli. Why must it exactly be a man? I'll marry his sister Lydia.
Cab. —(Astonished.) —How! His sister!
Gurli. Yes.

[Page 26]
Cab. Lydia!
Gurli. Yes, yes.
Cab. Why, she is a woman.
Gurli. What difference does that make?
Cab. —(Smiling.) —No, Gurli, that must not be. It is contrary to the laws of Brama. You are a girl, and must marry a man. Lydia is a girl too, and must also marry a man.
Gurli. Well, then, I'll marry Ganem.
Ganem. —(Who has, till now, been standing in deep meditation, arising from his late discourse with his master, recovers, and answers somewhat confused, but with his accustomed dryness.) —Me! Beauteous Gurli, that cannot be.
Gurli. —(Pettishly.) —Again! Why not? You are a man?
Ganem. [825]   That I grant.
Gurli. Well?
Ganem. I am an old man.
Gurli. What difference does that make?
Ganem. An old man must not marry a young woman.
Gurli. Why not?
Ganem. Because that were unmerciful to bury a rosebud in snow.
Mrs. T. —(Within.) —Ignoble every thought! Because you used to deal in soap and herrings, you are for ever instilling into the minds of your children the low-born notions of a tradesman.
Cab. Heaven have mercy on us! The dragon is approaching! I am so fond of this room— (pointing to the window) —on account of the sea-view from it, and this evil spirit always drives me to my lonely chamber. Come.
Gurli. Father, Gurli will stay here, and laugh at the old woman.

[Page 27]
Cab. As you like—But she is inquisitive. Beware lest you betray the secret of our rank. I wish not to be an object of curiosity or compassion.
                                         [Exeunt Caberdar and Ganem. Gurli. Oh, no! Gurli only wants to hear the old woman talk. She always talks so much nonsense.
Enter Mrs. Tradely . Mrs. T. —(Bawling to her husband as she enters.) —Gout! Pshaw! A noble spirit would despise the gout. [850]   All my ancestors had it in their twenty-fifth year, and none of them made half so much noise about it.— (Espying Gurli.) —Oh, Miss Gurli!— (Makes a deep curtsey. Gurli laughs in her face.) —Now, sur mon honneur such impertinence I never witnessed.
Gurli. Don't be angry, old mother.
Mrs. T. Old mother! Still better!
Gurli. Gurli likes to laugh. You must not take it amiss.
Mrs. T. Mon dieu! How I pity the pauvre creature's want of education! No. One of our family is exalted far above any affront.
Gurli. What family do you belong to?
Mrs. T. The illustrious race of Quirliquitch.
Gurli. Gurli never heard of that race. It must be a new one.
Mrs. T. —(Contemptuously.) —New! my good Madam; trace back whole centuries, and you will not have reached its origin. I should like to know where you had any opportunities of becoming acquainted with great families.
Gurli. I! I am sprung from one of the oldest in the whole world.
Mrs. T. —(Contemptuously.) —You! Ha! Ha! Ha!

[Page 28]
Gurli. Yes, yes, I. Gurli is sprung from the race of Raja.
Mrs. T. [875]   Raja! Raja! For the joke's sake, I will look in the books of heraldry whether these Rajas ever existed. The house is quite unknown to me.
Gurli. It is many thousand years old.
Mrs. T. Many thousand years! Ha! Ha! Ha! You have forgotten that the world is only one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine years old. Ha! Ha! Ha! I always thought the girl rather silly, but I now perceive she is quite deranged.— (Makes another disdainful curtsey, and exit at the middle door.)
Gurli. Ha! Ha! Ha! The foolish old woman! How she turns and twists her body, and draws up her head! Gurli must try to imitate her, for the joke's sake.— (Goes to the looking glass, and mimics Mrs. Tradely's gestures.) —Oh! I shall die with laughing. Gurli must let her father see it.
                                         [Exit.

END OF ACT I.

[Page 29]
ACT II. Scene Scene , as before. Enter Caberdar . Cab. My feet for ever bring me against my will into this room; and when in this room, my eyes are for ever riveted against my will upon that door. I must relieve my heart from this oppression; but should the trial fail —Oh, dreadful thought! Recollect, Caberdar, thou art not in India, where thou mayst imprison a wife, when she embitters thy domestic comfort; where, without thy permission, she is not even allowed to eat her meals at thy side. Thou art in Europe, where women are not debased to the rank of puppets, where they have themselves a will, and may even think —if they can. But on this girl the Gods bestowed a form, and Virtue a soul. Yet hold! Again in raptures! Do I know her? Have I long enough observed her? Is not her mother a woman begotten by Nirudi, king of the devils? And do roses ever grow on nettles? Ganem is right. The mildness of her eye may be hypocrisy: I must pry into her heart.
Enter Tom , with the gloves. Tom. I'll not run the soles off my shoes any longer. This is an unlucky day, and I shall not sell them, I'm sure.— (Seeing Caberdar.) —I'll make another trial, however. Sir, will you buy a pair of gloves?
Cab. No.
Tom. They were made by a pretty girl, I promise you.

[Page 30]
Cab. [25]   No matter.
Tom. Cheap too: only a crown.
Cab. Leave me in peace. I never wear gloves.
Tom. —(Peevishly throwing them on the table.) —Then he may wear them that will.— (As he is going.) —You lodge in this house, Sir. Give them to Miss Lydia when she comes.
Cab. Miss Lydia! Hold! What has Miss Lydia to do with these gloves?
Tom. They belong to her.
Cab. —(Astonished.) —To her!
Tom. —(Returning.) —Yes, Sir, she made them. Look at them. Did you ever see a prettier pair in your days? Buy them, buy them, Sir. They are as cheap as dirt at a crown; and if you will not betray me, I'll tell you a secret. Miss Lydia worked at them for five nights.
Cab. Why does she sell them then?
Tom. You ask strange questions, Sir. Because she has no money.
Cab. —(Hastily putting his hand into his pocket.) —How much, said you?
Tom. A crown, Sir; and for that you have as good a pair of gloves as the Prince of Wales can wear, and Heaven's blessing into the bargain.
Cab. There are three guineas.
Tom. I said a crown, Sir.
Cab. [50]   Those three guineas take to Miss Lydia; and here is a crown for yourself, on condition that you do not betray who was the purchaser of the gloves. Should she ask, say you sold them upon 'Change to a stranger, whom you never saw before.
Tom. —(Surveying the money, and turning it over with great delight.) —I understand you, Sir; I understand you, and thank you.

[Page 31]
Cab. —(Aside.) —This is noble in her. Amiable girl! Not to be ashamed of working for her daily bread.
Tom. I never saw so much money together in my life. God bless your honour!
Cab. Where are you going?
Tom. Away.
Cab. But the money?
Tom. That I have in my pocket.
Cab. Why do you not take it to Miss Lydia?
Tom. Because I have not finished my errand, Sir. Miss Lydia ordered me, as soon as I had sold the gloves, to buy a pint of Madeira.
Cab. How! Does she drink Madeira?
Tom. Not she, poor soul. I believe it is for her father. The poor old gentleman likes a drop in moderation now and then, but his wife and son won't let him have it.
Cab. —(Aside.) —Excellent, excellent girl!— (To the boy.) [75]   —Go then, go.                                          [Exit Tom. I am resolved. Such a heart must make me happy. Were she not beautiful, this filial affection would endow her with celestial charms. Though poor, she can work five nights for a sick father! I am resolved. Enter Lydia . Ha! She herself! Good morning, Miss Tradely.
Lydia. —(Moving to him as she passes.) —Good morning, Sir.— (Goes to the door, looks out; returns; walks to the window, and seems to be on every side in search of something.)
Cab. Miss Lydia probably expects some one.
Lydia. —(Turning.) —Yes, Sir, a boy, whom I sent on a little errand. I fancied a few minutes since that I saw him enter the house, but I must have been mistaken.—
[Page 32]
(She suddenly espies her gloves in the hands of Caberdar, and starts a little.)
Cab. —(As if unconscious of it.) —There has been a boy here; but probably not the one whom you expect. Look, Ma'am, I have just bought a pair of gloves. We men are often imposed upon in such articles. What is your opinion of them?
Lydia. —(Confused.) —They are very neat.
Cab. How much do you think them worth?
Lydia. A crown, probably.
Cab. Yes, Miss Lydia, they are indeed. Would I were possessed of a crown, that I might place it on the head of that incomparable girl! These gloves, according to the boy's account, have been made by a daughter at the expence of her nightly repose, to support a sick [100]   father.
Lydia. —(Much confused.) —Indeed!
Cab. How much do you now think them worth?
Lydia. As much as a child deserves who fulfils her duty.
Cab. Miss Tradely— (seizing her hand) —I am an honest man—Will you marry me?
Lydia. —(Surprised beyond all measure.) —Sir— Heavens!
Cab. —(Releasing her hand—in a gentle tone.) —Nay, compose yourself. Why are you alarmed? It was not my wish to alarm you. Your affections are, perhaps, engaged. Speak openly. It will grieve me, but I shall remain your friend. I shall, indeed, remain your friend.
Lydia. —(Who knows not what to say.) —Sir—I have a father and mother.
Cab. I must first speak to you—then to your parents. My dear Lydia, I am sorry to see you thus confused. Fancy us two friends, who are agreeing about a journey. The one asks, the other answers. Have you room for
[Page 33]
me? Are you not capricious, or ill-tempered? Are you not alarmed at a thunder-storm? Shall you wish for no other companion till you have reached the end of your journey? You know me, Miss Lydia. You have observed my actions. As I am to-day, I was yesterday; [125]   and as I was yesterday, I shall be to-morrow.
Lydia. But I shall not, Sir. The few charms which have perhaps to-day attracted you, will be to-morrow faded.
Cab. Miss Lydia, the hand which made these gloves will still be dear to me, when wrinkled and disabled it scarcely can support a crutch.
Lydia. You do not yet know me sufficiently; and allow me, Sir, to avail myself of your open candid style —I do not yet know you sufficiently.
Cab. 'Tis well. Examine me, observe me as often and as long as you please. I never yet shrunk from the eye of virtue.
Lydia. In the first place, I am even ignorant who you are.
Cab. Oh, I thank you, Miss Lydia, for demeaning yourself so far as to make the enquiry. This proves, at least, that the answer to my declaration is still doubtful. You shall learn who I am. As yet no heart in England has shared with me the secret of my rank and sufferings. I was born on the banks of the Ganges, in the lap of fortune, and educated by my uncle, the ruler of Mysore, a man of strict integrity, to whose throne and enemies I succeeded. I was then scarcely sixteen years of age. I had wives according to the customs of the country, [150]   and when little more than twenty years old, I was the father of five sons and a daughter. I was happy, for my subjects loved me. Englishmen and Frenchmen revered me; my enemies and neighbours feared me, and peace reigned throughout my realms. I was happy,
[Page 34]
for (thanks be to Providence) man is blind to futurity. That I was cherishing vipers in my bosom, that my own brothers were plotting against my crown and life, were sowing the seeds of rebellion among my subjects, my unsuspecting heart never augured. The conspiracy broke out. In an unhappy night the sceptre of Mysore was wrested from my hands; and oh! my wives and children fell a prey to my blood-thirsty conquerors. I, my daughter, and an old trusty servant, were lucky enough to reach the sea-shore. There lay two English vessels ready to sail, of which one received us, weighed anchor, and brought us to Lydia's native country, where, if she will restore to me what I have lost, this sigh for my past misfortunes is the last.
Lydia. —(With downcast eyes, after a pause.) —Then you are not a Christian?
Cab. —(Starts.) —There is but one way to Heaven— the way of virtue.
Lydia. That way leads through the Christian church.
Cab. Our Bramins tells us through the pagod. But [175]   be that as it may, I shall, with your hand, not refuse your wish. Well, Miss Lydia—any more objections? I like to hear, and like to answer them.
Lydia. —(Always with virgin bashfulness.) —Your wives, you say, fell victims to your enemies? They are, therefore, dead.
Cab. Most probably.
Lydia. You have no certain account of it?
Cab. No.
Lydia. But if they be still alive?
Cab. Still are they dead to me.
Lydia. How! Could you—
Cab. Do not, dear Lydia, judge my actions by European laws and customs. My wives were my slaves, whom I could cast from me when I liked. But granting
[Page 35]
that I loved them as—as I love you, what consolation will my affection and fidelity be to them, at the distance of several thousand miles? To me my native country is for ever lost. Never shall I again wander in the glad fields of India.
Lydia. Do you know, Sir, what inference I may deduce from this avowal?
Cab. Well?
Lydia. Were you hereafter to forsake England, you would marry another, under the pretext that your affection [200]   and fidelity could be of no more service to me.
Cab. You are right; but one circumstance you have forgotten. I shall vow fidelity to you, and shall never forsake England.
Lydia. Who will detain you?
Cab. Love.
Lydia. Oh, the poor weak child!
Cab. In our religion this child is a god.
Lydia. Your language is good, but not convincing.
Cab. I wish you would draw this conviction from my heart.
Lydia. Can my eye penetrate so far?
Cab. It is swimming in mine. But enough of this. Perhaps other circumstances will more powerfully convince you of my settled intention to end my days in England. All that I was able to rescue from my treasures on the unhappy night I have mentioned to you, was my diamonds—trifles for a prince, but a considerable property for a private man. I have here converted them into money, and bought estates. Do you know Glenmore Lodge?
Lydia. Glenmore Lodge was one of my favourite rides— (with a half-sigh) —when we had a coach.
Cab. It will remain with you alone to be there in future as often and as long as you please. You are the
[Page 36]
[225]   unlimited mistress of Glenmore Lodge. I settle it upon you as a jointure.
Lydia. No, Sir, that was far from my intention. Were we even to arrive so far—as we have not yet done, you never should persuade me to be so unjust towards your daughter.
Cab. Be at ease on that subject. My daughter will still possess a considerable dowry. I know my duty as a father, but I also know my duty towards myself. Well, Miss Lydia, have I removed all your scruples? May I place before your eyes the picture of a life spent in happy retirement—in the full enjoyment of every domestic comfort, at a delightful place like Glenmore Lodge, at the side of your husband, (who will certainly hereafter obtain your friendship and regard, if not your affection,) at the side of my good cheerful Gurli— (with downcast eyes) —in the circle of your children, and (what will perhaps be of more value to you than all) in the arms of your father, whom I will take into my house, whose latter days you will sweeten, who will revive at the contemplation of our happiness—
                                         [Breaks off suddenly, and silently surveys her. Lydia. —(Is much affected. With tears in her eyes, she turns from Caberdar, clasps her hands, looks towards Heaven, and remains some moments in this attitude. She then turns, and presents to him her hand.) —It is your's.
Cab. —(Seizes her hand with rapture, throws his arms round her neck, and kisses her.) —Best of daughters! Heaven bless our union! It is formed between two upright hearts.
Lydia. [250]   It is indeed.
Cab. —(Putting his ring on her finger.) —Farewell, dear Lydia; soon, very soon, to be my wife. My heart overflows with bliss. I must seek my old companion Ganem. He has shared with me my load of sorrow.
[Page 37]
To-day we will together quaff the cup of joy. Farewell. I shall wear these gloves upon my wedding-day.
                                         [Exit. Lydia. Have I, then, offered this sacrifice to filial affection, and could I so soon forget poor Fazir? Let me not indulge in romantic follies. Caberdar is a good man. How absurd were it to refuse him for the sake of a youth whose heart I only know by his eyes! Surely, of all the follies which a girl commits, her first attachment is the greatest. Enter Samuel . Brother, you may wish me joy.
Sam. Question: Of what?
Lydia. I shall shortly be married.
Sam. You!
Lydia. Yes, I. If you will not believe my words, believe your own eyes.
                                         [Holds the ring to his face. Sam. —(Seizes her hand with eagerness.) —Mercy on us! Let me look. To judge by the ring, your lover must be the first lord of the treasury. Zounds! sister, it is a mighty pretty ring. I really must kiss your hand.
Lydia. Well, it is for the first time in your life. [275]   What wonders can a sparkling diamond effect!
Sam. But—are you sure that your lover—that this ring—
Lydia. Is not stolen? The ring seems to you of greater consequence than the lover himself, for you have not even asked his name.
Sam. His name cannot possibly be of so much value as this ring. But now I naturally ask? What is his name?
Lydia. Caberdar.
Sam. —(Violently.) —Gurli's father!
Lydia. Yes.

[Page 38]
Sam. The blockhead, whose only object ought to be the acquisition of a cautious husband for his harumscarum daughter!
Lydia. In the first place, I beg leave, in the name of my future husband, to decline all titles of distinction. Next, with respect to your careful intentions as to Gurli, you need only give her step-mother a good word, should you wish—
Sam. I wish nothing till I have scrutinized.
Lydia. Still tormenting yourself with your ridiculous caution! The girl is good, pretty, and rich. What can you want further—except to be deserving of her?
Sam. Good. That question may, for the present, [300]   remain unanswered. Pretty? I Answer: Yes. Rich? There I naturally ask: How do you know that?
Lydia. Unaccountable mortal! I know it from Caberdar's own declaration, from his generosity towards me. Apropos , you used to course. I shall be glad to see you, if you feel disposed to kill a few hares at Glenmore Lodge next autumn.
Sam. You glad to see me at Glenmore Lodge!
Lydia. Exactly, brother. Let this be a proof to you of Caberdar's wealth. He, who can settle such an estate on his wife, will scarcely leave his daughter without a dowry.
Sam. There we have it! What a world is this? Here do I examine with the strictest caution, swallow all the news I can collect, place myself on my guard, secure myself on this side and that—come home, and find my incautious sister, who is cooped up like a goose, who never gathers a tittle of intelligence, sole mistress and inheritrix of Glenmore Lodge! On this occasion, I beg leave to ask: Fate, art thou just?
Lydia. Pshaw! This is nothing. Caberdar has brought such a store of diamonds with him, that Glenmore Lodge is a mere pebble to them.

[Page 39]
Sam. If this account be confirmed by more cautious and circumspect investigation, it will doubtless endow [325]   Gurli with new charms.
Lydia. It is most certainly true, brother. How happy shall we be in restoring plenty to our poor parents! How will my brother Robert rejoice, at his return from the West Indies!
Sam. Be not so hasty, sister. We are not yet arrived so far.
Lydia. You are not, to be sure, if Gurli will not have you.
Sam. —(In a tone of derision.) —Not have me! I could almost ask whether Lydia is in her senses?
Lydia. Hold! She is coming this way. Now you may at once lay siege to her heart. Shall I assist you?
Sam. I want no assistance.
Lydia. A corps de reserve may be of use.
Sam. I want no corps de reserve .
Enter Gurli . Gurli. My father says that Lydia wants to see me. Good morning, Lydia.
Lydia. Good morning. Did your father say nothing more?
Gurli. No.
Lydia. Nothing about my brother?
Gurli. That silly man there! Not a word. If he had told me that your brother was here, Gurli would not have come at all.
Sam. [350]   I could almost ask: Why?
Gurli. Go away. Gurli wants to talk with Lydia.
Lydia. —(To Samuel.) —Shall the corps de reserve advance?

[Page 40]
Sam. With caution.
Lydia. —(To Gurli.) —Your father says you are soon to be married.
Sam. Heavens! Lydia! How can you be so abrupt!
Gurli. —(Yawning.) —Yes. I am soon to be married.
Lydia. To whom?
Sam. Yes, to whom? Answer?
Gurli. Oh, dear Lydia, Gurli does not know that. My father thinks it right, and I think it right; but it seems to me exactly as if Gurli wanted a pomegranate, and no pomegranates grow in England. Gurli wanted to marry Lydia, but father said no. Gurli wanted to marry Ganem, but Ganem said no.
Lydia. Ganem is too old for you.
Gurli. Yes, yes, he said so.
Lydia. But there are many young men in the world.
(Samuel arranges his dress, &c.) Gurli. Yes, dear Lydia; but there is another very, very bad thing. My father says that if I marry, I must live with my husband; so that if my husband lives in Bengal, and my father in the country of the Mahrattas, Gurli must live with her husband in Bengal.
Lydia. Certainly.
Gurli. [375]   No. Gurli will never do that. Gurli loves her father so much.— (Weeps.) —No. Gurli can't leave her father. Gurli had rather not marry at all.
Lydia. Good girl!
Sam. But one question here naturally arises. Were a certain cautious man to be found, who lived in the same country—nay, even in the same town as your father—
Gurli. Ha! Ha! Ha! Yes. That would be delightful.
Sam. What think you, then, Miss Gurli? Could you love and marry me?

[Page 41]
Gurli. Love? No. That I could not; but I'll marry you, if it will oblige Lydia.
Lydia. Strange creature! Would you marry without love?
Gurli. Why not? Must I love the man who is to be my husband?
Lydia. You must respect him, at least.
Gurli. I must own, Lydia, that Gurli does not understand what marriage is.
Sam. That you will learn in due time. I shall have opportunities in future of giving you a few instructions in it. At present, nothing is requisite but a plain and simple answer to this plain and simple question: Will you marry me?
Gurli. —(To Lydia.) —Should you like it?
Lydia. [400]   Why—he is my brother.
Gurli. Well then, I'll marry you, silly man, on condition that you will always live where my father lives.
Sam. —(Aside.) —Shall I promise that? Why not? Just now I may consent to any thing.— (Aloud.) —The affection which will soon unite thee, lovely Gurli, to Mr. Samuel Tradely, is more powerful than filial tenderness. But one question remains to be answered: When are we to be married?
Gurli. When you like.— (To Lydia.) —Will it make you happy, if it be soon?
Lydia. I can have no objection.
Gurli. Then I'll marry you directly.
Sam. —(Astonished.) —Directly! No. I am by no means prepared for such an event.— (To Lydia.) —The good creature has caught fire, but we must proceed with proper circumspection.
Lydia. I think, brother, your wisest plan would be to leave circumspection out of the question, and take her at her word, lest she should change her mind.

[Page 42]
Sam. All that I can possibly do, is this. I'll go to a notary, then to another, and order them both to attend here this afternoon.
Lydia. Both! But why two?
Sam. One of them may be taken ill, break a leg, or [425]   drink too much at dinner. A thousand hindrances may occur.— (Lydia laughs.) —Laugh as you please. I have only to propose one question. Can these matters be managed too cautiously? Answer: No. I will go, and order both to bring a contract. I will then compare both, amend both, and, with the necessary caution, chuse one of the two. Meanwhile, lovely Gurli, I beg the favour of a salute.
Gurli. Oh! nasty man!
Sam. —(Astonished.) —How!
Gurli. —(To Lydia.) —Shall I kiss him?
Lydia. Undoubtedly.
Gurli. Well then, there!— (Kisses him, wipes her mouth, and calls after him.) —But I'll tell you what. If the notaries be handsomer than you, I'll marry them both.
                                         [Exit Samuel. Lydia. Well, dear Gurli, had you rather be my sister or my daughter?
Gurli. Gurli does not understand you.
Lydia. If you marry my brother, we shall be sisters.
Gurli. True. Gurli is glad of that.
Lydia. But if I marry your father, you will be my daughter.
Gurli. —(Looks for some time doubtfully at Lydia.) —Lydia is joking.
Lydia. Who knows? I shall probably be in earnest, if [450]   I could only learn who your father exactly is. What think you? Can you explain the enigma?
Gurli. Hist! Gurli must not mention that.
Lydia. Why not? To me you may.

[Page 43]
Gurli. Not to my parrot, not to my cat, not to the rose-tree in my chamber.
Lydia. But the reason?
Gurli. My father has forbidden it.
Lydia. Is your father's prohibition so sacred to you?
Gurli. He never forbad any thing before.
Lydia. —(Embraces her.) —Good, dear girl!
Gurli. Silly Lydia!
Lydia. As you are so mysterious, I must probably call my guardian spirit to my aid.
Gurli. —(Alarmed.) —Spirit! Have you one? Oh, Lydia! I am frightened.
Lydia. You need not be so; for he is the friend of all good people.
Gurli. Is he? But is Gurli really good?
Lydia. I am sure she is.
Gurli. Well! What says your guardian spirit?
Lydia. —(Appears to be listening to something.) —He says your father was once Nabob of Mysore.
Gurli. —(Creeps affrighted towards Lydia.) —Oh, Lydia! he is right.
Lydia. —(As above.) [475]   —He says Gurli will relate the rest.
Gurli. Does he? Then Gurli must.
Lydia. Be not alarmed, my dear girl.
Gurli. Send him away, and I'll tell you all.
Lydia. —(Waves her hand.) —There! He is gone.
Gurli. Are you quite sure of it?
Lydia. Quite sure.
Gurli. But Gurli does not understand how to describe any thing. She never knows how to begin, or how to end. My father was Nabob of Mysore. He was just and good. They called him the fountain of justice, for he used to punish the great men, if they were wicked, as well as the poor. He paid no regard to
[Page 44]
riches,— (weeping,) —and yet they drove him from his native country, and killed all his wives and his other children, and only left Gurli alive.
Lydia. Who drove him from his native country, and why?
Gurli. Well—my father had two brothers, a couple of ugly frightful men. Ha! Ha! Ha! One of them squinted, and had a long nose; and the other had a head like the great hollow things which the jugglers in our country put snakes into. Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, his head was full of snakes too. The bad man! Lydia, there are [500]   very bad men in the world.— (Clenching her fist and stamping.) —If I had him here, I would twist my nails into his bristly hair. He wanted to be Nabob of Mysore too, and so did he with the long nose. Well, there they plotted together, and gained several supporters, and fell upon us all one night. Oh, Lydia! what cries and shouts, and shrieks and noises there were! Hoo! I shudder when I think of that night. I sprung out of bed; but I had almost quite lost my senses. Ha! Ha! Ha! I fastened my gold necklace round my arm, and tied my apron round my head.— (Weeping.) —My poor father was forced to fly in the dark, and Gurli fled with him. Gurli sat in a palanquin, and Ganem helped to carry the palanquin,— (laughing;) —but as he was not used to it, he fell in the dirt. At last we reached the sea. My father was grave and sorrowful, and did not say a word,— (weeping,) —and Gurli cried very much for her mother, and her brothers. We went into an English ship. The English captain was a good-natured droll man,— (laughing.) —He used to make Gurli laugh very often. We sailed many days, and many weeks, one after another. At last Gurli was tired; and at last and at last we came here. Now I've told you all.

[Page 45]
Lydia. I thank you, and will return your confidence. But you have not yet answered my first question, whether [525]   you had rather be my sister or my daughter.
Gurli. Well, Gurli would rather be your sister.
Lydia. Why?
Gurli. Because Gurli once had a mother, a good good mother; Gurli can't wish for a better, but Gurli never had a sister.
Lydia. Then we will live together as sisters. Gurli, I shall shortly be married to your father.
Gurli. No. Lydia. Don't joke with Gurli in this way.
Lydia. I am not joking. He left me but just now, and Heaven was the witness of our mutual covenant.
Gurli. Indeed! Ha! Ha! Ha!— (Skips round the room, snaps her fingers and sings.) —Oh! I am glad to hear it! I am glad to hear it! How happy I am! Lydia, I must kiss you.— (Takes her head between both hands, and kisses her with violence.)
Lydia. Happy girl! Teach me to remain a child like thee.
Gurli. So my father knows you will marry him?
Lydia. —(Laughing.) —To be sure he does.
Gurli. That's a pity. I wish he had not known it, that Gurli might have been the first to tell him.
Lydia. But he does not know that you will marry my brother.
Gurli. Oh, that he will learn soon enough.
Enter Jack . Lydia. —(With a cry of astonishment and joy.) [550]   —Ha, Jack! Where is your master?
Jack. —(Always in a dry honest tone.) —Aboard. We have just steered into harbour.

[Page 46]
Lydia. —(Transported beyond herself.) —Gurli! Gurli! Rejoice with me. Brother Robert is come. Father! Mother! My brother Robert is come.
                                         [Exit. Gurli. —(Dancing and running up and down the room.) —Delightful! Delightful! Brother Robert is come. But tell me—Who is brother Robert?
Jack. Captain Robert and Miss Lydia were launched off the same stocks, so they are brother and sister.
Gurli. He is her brother, then. Delightful! Lydia is so happy; and Gurli is happy too, when Lydia is so. Come here, you ugly man. I must kiss you for the good news.— (Kisses the astonished sailor, turns, and, as she skips into the next room,) —Brother Robert is come! Brother Robert is come!
                                         [Exit. Jack. Damn me if I think that girl is overloaded with sense, however. I reckon no more on all these smooth womens' faces than on a rotten cable. I wish we were off at sea again, for I know no good that we shall do among these land lubbers. The old gentleman is well enough; but his timbers begin to fail. God knows how long he may drive before the wind. As for the old woman, she is a hurricane, and never blows from one point, [575]   but runs all round the compass.
(Lydia pushes Tradely's chair forward.) Trad. Welcome home, honest old Jack.
Jack. Thank you, Sir; thank you. How does your honour do?
Trad. Not very well, Jack.
Jack. Ay, ay, your old hull begins to crack, I see. You're obliged to be towed by Miss.
Trad. But just at present my transport overpowers my pain. How is my son?
Jack. Brave and hearty. He's just astern of me. He'll be here before a body can reef the mizen-top-sail.

[Page 47]
Trad. Well, honest Jack, give me some account of your voyage in the meantime. You and your messmates shall afterwards have some ale.
Jack. Thank your honour. We weighed anchor with clear weather, and a breeze at south-south-east. The wind has been rather hard against us now and then; but, thank God, we always weathered it handsomely.
Trad. You have not encountered these perils in vain, I hope. Your purses are well lined?
Jack. Not they, by my soul, Sir.
Trad. But you took a very pretty cargo from home with you.
Jack. So we did, Sir, and cleared a good freight by it too; but, damn me, if it is not all flown away!
Trad. [600]   Impossible! Can Robert, forgetful of his father's necessities, have squandered all?
Jack. Avast there! Say not a word against your son, Sir; for an honester fellow never chewed a quid. You must know that on our voyage home, as we were steering some two hundred leagues west of the Canaries, we one morning from the mast-head spied a bit of a thing like a sail. Presently after, we heard a couple of guns, and plainly saw some canvas. “Holla!” cries the captain; “those may be signals of distress,” says he; and by my soul, so they were too. We hauled in her top-gallant-sails, put her about, and sailed till we came nearer. I've seen cruel things in my time, Sir;— (wiping his eyes;) —but damn me if my bowsprit aloft here is not splashed with salt-water whenever I think of it. A little crazy boat—there lay twenty-three people, who for five days had never champed a bit of biscuit between their teeth. Their ship had taken fire at sea; and they had but just been able to save their lives in the boat, since which they had been driving before the wind, as fortune might direct them. In four-and-twenty hours
[Page 48]
more, it would have been over with the poor devils. The captain was a Dutchman. He had lost every thing, except his life, and a seaman's honour. Near him sat a young woman, with three little children, who had not a [625]   morsel to bite or break. When he looked at them, he pumped water out of both his holds. My master could not stand it. “Friend,” says he, “I have neither wife nor child. There's a few hundreds—take them,” says he.—So we landed the whole crew at the first place we came to.
Trad. Did he do this? Then Heaven bless him for it! I am glad he has brought nothing, and he shall share my last morsel.
Lydia. Good brother! Have I not always told you, Sir, that Robert would be the pride of your declining years?
Trad. The pride and joy of my declining years.
Lydia. Ha! There he is!
Enter Robert . (Lydia flies into his arms.) Robert. —(Pressing her to his heart.) —My dear Lydia!
Trad. —(Trying to push his chair forward.) —Confound this gout! Help me, Jack. Holla, boy! Your father is here.
Robert. —(Embracing him rather roughly.) —Best of fathers!
Trad. Oh! O—h! Zounds! Don't you know I have the gout? Well, well, it is over. Come hither. This shake of the hand is a proof of my joy at you return, and— (laying his hand upon him) —be this blessing the reward of your noble action.
Robert. [650]   What action, my father?
Lydia. Oh, we know all.

[Page 49]
Robert. —(In a tone of displeasure.) —Has Jack been playing the old woman?
Jack. Don't take it amiss, Sir; for I really could not help it. My tongue got afloat.
Trad. Go in, go in, both of you. Your mother is within, Robert, and will probably for once look pleased. — (Trying to move his chair.) —Away with you all! Help a poor sinner forward.
Jack. I'll drop astern, Sir.
                                         [Pushes off the chair. Manet Lydia . Lydia. How is this? Alas! how strange are my sensations! I had not courage to ask where he was. Is he returned, or has he remained in the West Indies? Or is he ill—or dead? Alas! how does this concern me? Why should I make these enquiries? Fate is resolved to try whether I was in earnest, when I made a sacrifice of my first attachment to filial duty. It seemed so easy to me. Alas! it is not so easy as I thought. Well, so much the more glorious is the conquest. But I may surely remain his friend. I should like to know what is become of him. Such a wish cannot be wrong. When Jack returns, I will enquire.
Enter Fazir . Fazir. —(Flies to Lydia, and seizes her hand.) —There she is! There she is! Oh, dear Miss Lydia! Fazir is [675]   returned, and is so happy, so happy! Good dear Miss Lydia, Fazir cannot express what he feels. Have you always been well? Have you always been happy? Have you sometimes bestowed a thought upon Fazir?
Lydia. —(Much confused.) —Very often—only not today.

[Page 50]
Fazir. My guardian angel knew it, and filled our canvas with a prosperous breeze. We are arrived; and now, dear Lydia, you must think of me. But you don't rejoice at my return. I did not expect you to rejoice so much as myself; but yet you might a little; a very little; for I am really your friend.
Lydia. —(Agitated, gives him her hand.) —I do indeed rejoice.
Fazir. —(Kissing her hand with ardour.) —I really have deserved that you should feel some little regard for me. I have always thought of you, and of nothing but you. When the sun rose from the ocean, I stretched forth my arms, and prayed. I thought to have prayed for myself, and prayed for Lydia. When the surface of the sea was smooth as a mirror, I sought in it the form of Lydia; and I found it too; for I found it wherever I sought it. Oh, I found it without seeking it.
Lydia. —(Turns away, and wipes her eyes.) —Thou image of my poor sick father, support me at this hour.
Fazir. And when at last the coast of England lay before [700]   us in the blue horizon, oh, Lydia, how great was the rapture of silly Fazir! It was in the evening of yesterday. I danced upon the deck throughout the night; and when the morning dawned, a bird flew from the shore, and perched upon our mast. I called to it; I beckoned to it; I whistled to it; I could have kissed it. Perhaps, thought I, Lydia was walking yesterday, and this bird sung to her.
Lydia. —(Aside.) —I must put an end to this. It is too much for my poor heart.— (Stammering.) —Do you know Fazir—that I—am shortly to be married?
Fazir. —(Violently alarmed.) —Indeed!— (A long pause. Lydia casts her eyes upon the earth. Fazir mournfully offers his hand.) —Farewell, dear Miss Lydia.
Lydia. Where are you going?

[Page 51]
Fazir. I—I will away—to sea—into the sea. Farewell, dear Miss Lydia.— (Holds her hand. Another pause.) —Yes, I will away—But I cannot—Indeed I cannot. Miss Lydia is really soon to be married?
Lydia. Really.
Fazir. And will she be happy?
Lydia. She hopes so.
Fazir. Well, Fazir will not be happy. But that is nothing, if Lydia be but happy. May I know the man who has gained Miss Lydia's affections? No, no, I do not wish to know him. I hate no one. He has done [725]   me no injury. Oh, yes, he has done me a very great injury.
Lydia. —(Deeply affected, giving him her hand.) —Remain my friend.
Fazir. Yes, dear Miss Lydia, Fazir would die for you. Alas! it is about six weeks since we encountered a dreadful storm. I was afraid of death; for I wanted so much to see Lydia again. Oh! I was a fool to be afraid of death—It would have been better if I had never seen Lydia again.
Lydia. Will you not ask my father and mother how they do?
Fazir. Oh, yes, Miss Lydia, if you desire it. I will do every thing which you desire.
Lydia. —(Taking his hand.) —Come, then, come. It is not proper that we should stay here discussing things which cannot now be altered. Friendship must heal the wounds which love inflicts.
                                         [She leads him away. Enter Mrs. Tradely, Robert , and Jack . Mrs. T. But, mon fils , it was by no means noble conduct thus to dissipate the property earned with so much labour.

[Page 52]
Robert. I beg your pardon, mother. It was, on the contrary, the noblest action of my life.
Mrs. T. By what will you now support your rank in the world?
Robert. By my principles.
Mrs. T. [750]   Right, mon fils . That is a noble sentiment. — (Espies Fazir.) — Bon jour, Monsieur Fazir. Je suis charmée de vous revoir en bonne santé .— (Turning again to Robert.) —But the dèhors must not be neglected. The sun, it is true, remains the sun, even if it be concealed by a thick fog; but it only dazzles our eyes when it appears in the full blaze of majesty. What do you think of this allegory?
Robert. I dare say it is a very pretty one, mother; but I am not a sun, and do not wish to dazzle the eyes of any body.
Mrs. T. I wish, then, you had at least borrowed some warmth from its beams. You are not ignorant that poverty reigns in this house, that we have awaited your return with anxiety.
Robert. —(Shrugging his shoulders.) —Upon my soul I am sorry for it; but had I, at that moment, been possessed of millions, it would have flown out of my pocket to the last shilling.
Lydia. Dear mother, our poverty will soon vanish, if you will not deny me your consent and blessing.
Mrs. T. My blessing you have at all times; but my consent—to what? If it be compatible with honour—
Lydia. I think it is. Our lodger has solicited my hand.
Mrs. T. —(In a lofty disdainful tone.) [775]   —Indeed!
Lydia. He is a worthy man.
Mrs. T. Indeed!
Lydia. Rich.
Mrs. T. Indeed!

[Page 53]
Robert. —(Shaking hands with Lydia.) —Sister, I wish you joy with all my heart.
Fazir. —(With a sigh.) —And I too, Miss Lydia.
Jack. —(With a scrape.) —Fair weather and pleasant breezes on the voyage, Miss.
Mrs. T. Be not so hasty, all of you, I beg.—Lydia, you know my sentiments.
Lydia. I do; but if I prove to you that his descent is irreproachable.
Mrs. T. That would give the affair another tournure .
Lydia. You will soon learn it from himself. He promised that he would wait on you in a few minutes.
Mrs. T. Did he? Then we must make a little-preparation for his reception. Come, Lydia, lest he should surprise us here. But I assure you I am a connoisseur in these matters. By the way in which he will conduct an affair of so much delicatesse , I shall easily know how to distinguish the homme de qualité .
                                         [Exeunt Mrs. Tradely and Lydia. Robert. She did not even allow me time to ask my sister the name of her future husband.
Jack. [800]   He will not be ashamed of his flag, I hope.
Fazir. He must be a good man, because Lydia loves him.
Robert. My brother Samuel, too, is going to thrust his cautious neck into the yoke of matrimony. Hem! shall I sail through the world alone, then? What think you, Jack?
Jack. I think, Sir, you had better keep yourself easy while you are so. He that takes a wife, anchors on damned bad ground, and can't weigh when he likes for the life of him. A girl nows and thens is well enough; but if you attempt to sail through life's voyage with a wife on board, damn me if you won't founder.
Robert. Do you think so too, Fazir?

[Page 54]
Fazir. I think it best to die.
Robert. To die! Are you mad? Jack, what's the matter with our young messmate?
Jack. I think he may perhaps have taken too much love on board.
Robert. Is it so, Fazir?
Fazir. It is indeed, good Robert.
Robert. How the deuce can this be? Why, we have not been in port more than a couple of hours. You are damned quick in catching fire.
Fazir. Oh, I loved before we left England.
Robert. [825]   And never said a word to me about it?
Fazir. I loved so secretly, so tenderly—you could not have understood me.
Robert. Hark ye, honest messmate: when we were lying on the deck in a calm, and enjoying the warm sun-beams, when our vessel seemed to be nailed to the spot, you might, I think, have told me what a tempest was raging in your heart. How is this? Has not Robert merited your confidence? Am I not the only one acquainted with the secret of your rank? Have I ever betrayed you?
Fazir. —(Falling on his neck.) —Forgive me, dearest friend. It is not ingratitude; it is not indeed. You snatched me from death. You rescued me, at the peril of your own life, from my barbarous pursuers. I never shall forget that. Indeed, indeed, I am not ungrateful.
Robert. Well, well, enough of this! I did not wish to force thanks from you. I only require the confidence of a friend. Who is your girl?
Fazir. My girl! Alas, no. The girl whom I love is Lydia.
Robert. Lydia! Zounds! My sister!
Fazir. Yes.
Robert. Poor fellow! Now I understand why you want to die. You have probably anticipated great happiness at
[Page 55]
your return, and find her on the point of being married [850]   to another. It is a bad business, I must own; but let us make the best of it. Matrimony is a wind, which is not favourable to either of us. Let us put to sea again; and, instead of love, take friendship for our compass. You shall be my foremast, and Jack my mizen. With such tackle I hope to weather many a gale; but if you forsake me, I must founder.
Jack. If I ever forsake you, call me a lubber.
Robert. —(To Fazir.) —Cheer up, my honest fellow. Away with all this whining and blubbering! Come! Here at home all is not so cheerful as I wish. Let us step into the next tavern, and crack a bottle to Lydia's health and happiness.
Fazir. Yes—to Lydia's health and happiness.
                                         [Exeunt

END OF ACT II.

[Page 56]
ACT III. Scene Scene , as before. Staff and Stuff are discovered exchanging Compliments at the Door. Stuff. Unexpected happiness!
Staff. Agreeable surprise!
Stuff. To meet Mr. Staff in my way.
Staff. To find Mr. Stuff here.
Stuff. Pray walk in.
Staff. It cannot be.
Stuff. Must indeed! Must indeed!
Staff. I am not so unpolite. I know very well that the first place among the gentlemen of our profession belongs to my worthy friend Mr. Stuff.
Stuff. You joke, you joke. But why this ceremony between two such intimate friends?
                                         [Draws him in. Staff. Ay, two such intimate friends.
                                         [They shake hands. Both. —(Aside, at the same time.) —The devil take him!
Stuff. How are all at home? Perfectly well, I hope?
Staff. Perfectly, I thank you. Whenever I appear there, I am always asked whether I have seen my respected friend Mr. Stuff. And how are all the good people at your house? How does my little godson Jacob go on?
Stuff. He is a droll little fellow, I assure you. I daily place before his eyes his worthy godfather as an example. — (Both bow to each other.) — (Aside.) —What an ass [25]   it is!

[Page 57]
Staff. —(Aside.) —What a porpoise it is!
Stuff. —(Aside.) —What can he want here?
Staff. —(Aside.) —What the devil has brought him hither?
Stuff. My learned colleague has probably business here?
Staff. Exactly. The same is probably the case with my learned friend Mr. Stuff?
Stuff. At your service. May one be so bold as to ask what kind of business?
Staff. A trifle. A marriage-contract.
Stuff. —(Whose anger is beginning to rise.) —Indeed! A marriage-contract! You can scarcely be in earnest. I am come hither on the same business.
Staff. Indeed! Then is this house blessed indeed. Mr. Samuel Tradely, the comptroller of the customs, appointed my attendance here.
Stuff. Indeed! The same gentleman appointed mine.
Staff. Indeed! Odd enough, and scarcely credible.
Stuff. —(Incensed.) —Credible or incredible, it is true.
Staff. You must be mistaken, Sir.
Stuff. I am never mistaken, Sir; and once for all, Sir, let me tell you, Sir, you are a man devoid of conscience, and go about for the purpose of snapping the [50]   bread from your neighbour's mouth.
Staff. What, Sir! dare you—
Stuff. Yes, Sir, I dare.
Staff. You shall repent it.
Stuff. That we will see.
Staff. You will do best, Sir, if you return to the place from whence you came.
Stuff. And you will do best, if you go to the place of execution—or to the devil.
Staff. Then I must go home with you.

[Page 58]
Stuff. I should be ashamed of appearing in the streets with such a pettifogging fellow.
Staff. The world would be astonished to see you for once in respectable company.
Stuff. I am always in respectable company when not in your's.
Staff. Sir, you are growing insolent.
Stuff. And you are so already.
Staff. If you do not think proper to keep your tongue within bounds, you shall feel the weight of this fist.
Stuff. As soon as you like. I have long wished to thresh such a hound.
Staff. Come on, then; though I shall gain no great honour by trampling on such a swine.
[Both cast off their coats and wigs, place themselves in the attitude of two pugilists, and are about to fight.] Enter Hurry . Hurry. —(Springs between them.) —Quick! Quick! [75]   What the deuce are you about? Why, gentlemen, I believe you wanted to knock each other's brains out as quick as thought.
Stuff. —(Pointing to Staff.) —You are that fellow's guardian angel.
Staff. —(Pointing to Stuff.) —That fellow is obliged to you for his life.
Stuff. But we shall meet again, Mr. Staff.
Staff. Yes, we shall meet again, Mr. Stuff.
Hurry. Will you have the goodness to inform me, why you were disposed to break each other's bones as quick as lightning?
(Staff and Stuff, both bawl together.) The One. He asserts that Mr. Samuel Tradely appointed him to come hither with a marriage contract, whereas he desired me to bring it.

[Page 59]
The Other. He declares that he received orders to prepare a marriage contract for Mr. Samuel Tradely, whereas that gentleman requested me to attend with it.
Hurry. —(Covering his ears.) —Hold, I beseech you, gentlemen. Zounds! I believe you'll break the drums of my ears.
Enter Samuel . Both. —(Running towards him.) —Here is the contract.
Sam. Be cautious, gentlemen; be cautious. You'll knock me down.
Stuff. Do I not appear here by your desire?
Sam. [100]   Certainly.
Staff. Did you not appoint me to come hither?
Sam. Certainly.
Stuff. Did you not order me to prepare a marriage-contract for you?
Sam. Certainly.
Staff. Was I not to bring a marriage-contract with me?
Sam. Certainly.
Stuff. Now, Mr. Staff!
Staff. Now, Mr. Stuff!
Stuff. But dare one ask, Sir, why you have employed two of the most learned and respected lawyers in the place, about a business which might easily have been managed by half of one?
Sam. Why? Might not some accident have happened to one of you, and hindered your appearance at the appointed time?
Staff. It was not wise to act thus, Sir. You had nearly been the cause of a bloody quarrel between me and my worthy colleague Mr. Stuff.
Stuff. It was very inconsiderate indeed, Sir, to cause a dispute on so trifling an occasion between two such intimate friends.

[Page 60]
Staff. If we had not so great a regard for each other—
Stuff. And so great a respect— (they shake hands) — [125]   Ha! Ha! Ha!
Staff. Ha! Ha! Ha! Our friendship is as firm as a rock.
Stuff. In spite of every storm.
Hurry. A brisk boxing-match, and a speedy reconciliation! This is swift as lightning indeed. Such haste is praise-worthy.
Sam. Where are the contracts?
Both. Here.
Sam. I request that you will read them deliberately and audibly.
Stuff. Read, Mr. Staff.
Staff. I beg you will read, Mr. Stuff.
Stuff. Heaven forbid! I know my duty.
Staff. And I mine.
Stuff. Why all this ceremony? Two such celebrated men can only have one method of drawing up a contract. It is, therefore, immaterial which of the two reads.
Staff. For that very reason—
Stuff. Well, as you are so very pressing.— (Puts on his spectacles, and reads.) —“Be it known unto all whom it may concern—”
Staff. —(Who consults his own manuscript.) —With permission, Sir, it ought to begin: “Know all men by these presents.”
Stuff. —(Incensed.) [150]   —Why so, Sir?
Staff. Because it is impossible to know every individual whom it may concern; but if all are informed by the contract, why you know, of course—all are informed.
Stuff. —(Contemptuously.) —A very correct definition.
Staff. —(The same.) —Not calculated for every understanding, to be sure.

[Page 61]
Stuff. You are an ignoramus, Sir.
Staff. How! What! I an ignoramus! Were I to divide my legal knowledge among ninety-nine people, they would each be as learned as Mr. Stuff.
Stuff. Yes, if they were so before.
Sam. I beg your pardon, Mr. Stuff; but I think Mr. Staff is right.
Stuff. How! He right!
Sam. Caution commands the use of the most explicit terms.
Stuff. You are a fool with your caution.
Staff, Sam. and Hurry. —(Together.) —A fool! A fool! Impertinent fellow! Out with him! Down stairs with him.— (They fall upon him, and drive him to the door.)
Stuff. —(As they drive him out.) —And I say it ought to be: “Be it known unto all whom it may concern.”
Sam. Now, Mr. Staff, we are quiet, and may examine the contract with the necessary caution. Read.
Staff. —(Puts on his spectacles and reads.) [175]   —“Know all men by these presents,”—
Stuff. —(Puts his head in at the door.) —“Be it known unto all whom it may concern.”
Hurry. —(Driving him away.) —Quick! Quick! Begone! Begone! Begone!
Enter Caberdar from his room. Cab. I can bear it no longer. May I ask, Sir, whether some evil spirit is let loose?
Hurry. We have this instant turned him out as quick as thought.
Cab. Whom? The evil spirit!
Staff. Yes, Sir, the evil spirit, I assure you; the spiritus infernalis , the cacodœmon .

[Page 62]
Sam. We are here assembled, Sir, to consult on the happiness of your daughter.
Cab. How can the happiness of my daughter concern you?
Sam. Very nearly, Sir. Miss Gurli feels that she is in want of a cautious companion, who weighs his words, and selects his steps upon the slippery path of life. Her wise, praise-worthy and irreproachable choice has fallen on me. One only question, therefore, remains: Has Gurli's father any objection?
Cab. —(Looks at him with a scrutinizing eye, shakes his head, turns, opens the door of his room, and calls) —Gurli!
Gurli. —(Within.) —Father!
Cab. [200]   Come hither.
Enter Gurli . Gurli What do you want, father?— (Espies the Notary.) —Ha! Ha! Ha!
Cab. Be serious, Gurli.
Gurli. —(Stroking his cheek.) —What does my father want?
Cab. —(Pointing to Samuel.) —Will you marry this man?
Gurli. I promised Lydia I would.
Cab. Do you love him?
Gurli. I love Lydia.
Cab. Lydia will not be your husband, but this man.
Gurli. But he is Lydia's brother.
Cab. —(Aside.) —That is his greatest merit.
Gurli. And he will always live where you do, father. Gurli will never leave you, and Lydia will live there too. Is not it so, silly Samuel?
Sam. Yes.
Cab. You hope, then, to be happy with him?

[Page 63]
Gurli. Not with him alone, but with him, with you, and with Lydia.
Cab. Well, Heaven bless you! I can have no objection.— (Embraces his daughter, and afterwards Samuel, who assumes an air of great solemnity.) —Sir, you become at once my son and my brother.
Sam. Two-fold honour, two-fold happiness, two-fold [225]   gratification! Is it agreeable to hear the contract read?
Cab. To me it is immaterial, as it can but concern me in one point—the dowry.
Staff. For that we have left room.
                                         [Shewing him the paper. Cab. Yes, and so much, that one might include in it the title of a great kingdom, with all the provinces, which it does and does not possess. Did you think me so rich?
Sam. Very rich, and very generous.
Cab. Indeed! Then I must be an uncommon man, for rarely have I seen riches and generosity combined. But every virtue may degenerate by being carried to excess; so may generosity. You know, Sir, I am myself on the point of matrimony, and it is very possible that a dozen more children may have the same claim as Gurli upon a father's generosity.
Sam. —(Confused.) —Yes, yes.
Hurry. So! So!
Staff. Hem! Hem!
Cab. How much, therefore, do you think necessary to enable you to live with my daughter neither in poverty nor affluence, neither penuriously nor prodigally?
Sam. Why, in such cases it is always better to calculate too high than to low.
Cab. Suppose, then, that in the middle path we were [250]   to stumble upon ten thousand pounds?
Sam. —(Much pleased.) —We should not let them lie.

[Page 64]
Hurry. —(Apart to Samuel.) —Quick! Conclude the bargain. Quick!
Staff. Shall I insert that sum here?
Sam. Moreover, I flatter myself with a favourable answer to the following question. Should Heaven be pleased to bless our union with children—
Gurli. Ha! Ha! Ha! Shall we have children, too?
Sam. I hope so.
Gurli. Oh! how Gurli will laugh! Gurli never had any children yet.
Staff. Hora ruit ; that is, time flies away. Is it agreeable to the contracting parties to give this deed by their respective signatures its authenticity, sufficiency, formality and legality?
Sam. Well said. Go, dear Hurry, and summon all my family. Every individual of it must be present on this solemn occasion.— (Exit Hurry.) —Have the goodness to allow another question. In what religion are the fruits of this marriage to be educated? Answer?
Cab. —(Rather warmly.) —Educate them to be virtuous members of society. In other respects, do what you like with them.
Enter Tradely , Mrs. Tradely, Lydia and Hurry . Hurry. Here they come! Here they come!
Mrs. T. —(After having made a careless curtsey to the company, walks directly to her son.) [275]   — Mon fils , you see your mother driven au desespoir . Will you be such a barbarian as to graft a crab upon a peach-tree?
Sam. —(Drawing her towards him.) —There are no roses without thorns.
                                         [They converse apart. Gurli. —(To Lydia.) —Well, sister, are you satisfied with Gurli?
Lydia. Gurli is a good girl.

[Page 65]
Trad. —(To Caberdar.) —Sir, you have made an old man confused in the philosophy of life. Had I been told that upon a road where thousands daily pass, I should find a treasure, I could sooner have believed it, than that I should meet with a rich man, who generously unites himself to a ruined family.
Cab. Oh, Sir, what a country is your Europe, if this be true! Our sultry climate does not breed such principles.
Trad. Your hand, Sir. I have long wished to grasp the hand of an honest man. You are my physician. You pour fresh strength and life into my feeble frame.
Cab. Still am I not disinterested. My reward is a pearl,— (with a tender look towards Lydia,) —which neither Ceylon nor Arabia Felix, Japan nor Margarita, can produce.
                                         [Converses with Lydia. Hurry. —(To Staff.) —All this is very well; but such things should be finished as quick as thought.
Staff. [300]   True; and, above all things, the formalities should be observed. Love, gratitude, happiness, and those little nick-nacks follow of course.
Sam. But, dear mother, at this rate we may go to bed hungry every night.
Mrs. T. Go, then. I abandon you. All the noble sentiments I have instilled into your mind are lost upon you.
Gurli. —(Who has crept behind them, puts her head between them.) —What are you talking about so secretly?
Mrs. T. Very polite behaviour, truly! How can I ever think of introducing such a creature into the brilliant circles of fashion!
Cab. —(Somewhat hurt.) —I hope, Madam, she will some day make a better figure in the circle of her children.
Mrs. T. —(Contemptuously.) —No doubt a good mother has merit, too.
Trad. Yes, in every rank of life. Of that our gracious queen is an illustrious example.
Sam. We are wasting time.

[Page 66]
Hurry. Very true! Very true!
Gurli. Well, then, let us go on.
Staff. The contract is ready to be signed.
Sam. Very well. Here are pen and ink.— (Laying the paper flat on the table.) —Here Miss Gurli will sign her name.
Gurli. You think Gurli can't write, perhaps. Give [325]   me the pen, silly man.
                                         [Takes it. Cab. —(Uneasily.) —Once more, my daughter, recollect that the happiness of your whole life depends upon a single word. When you have written it, your promise is irrevocable.
Gurli. Oh, dear father, Gurli will sign it. Only look, Lydia looks as if she wished it; and so does that old man. I like that old man—he looks so honest.
Cab. Well, it is your own choice. My blessing and the blessing of the Almighty be upon you!
                                         [Gurli is going to sign. Sam. Hold, beauteous Gurli. Stop a single moment. I feel at once so fearful, so alarmed—Is nothing forgotten? No explanatory clause?
Staff. Nothing whatever. I have provided against every contingency.
Trad. Samuel, this conduct betrays but little tenderness.
Mrs. T. Perhaps the spirits of his ancestors are whispering to him at this decisive moment.
Sam. Not they indeed, honoured mamma.— (To Caberdar.) —The ten thousand pounds, Sir, which you were so kind as to mention, will, I presume, be paid immediately after the solemnization of marriage?
Cab. —(Very coldly.) —On the very day, Sir.
Sam. Sign then, charming Gurli.— (She attempts to write.) —But stop. Let me have another moment's [350]   consideration. I really feel myself in a very singular situation. One cannot be too cautious. But one more
[Page 67]
question, Sir. Will the ten thousand pounds be paid in bills or cash?
Cab. —(Displeased.) —As you please, Sir, as you please.
Sam. In cash then, if agreeable to you, Sir.
Cab. It is perfectly agreeable.
Sam. Sign, then.
Gurli. —(As she is preparing to write.) —You silly man, you tire me.
Sam. Hold, hold, another moment.
Lydia. Brother, you are insufferable.
Cab. —(To Lydia.) —You are his guardian angel.
Sam. One material question still remains to be answered. Should my dear Gurli's father depart this life without any other issue—
Cab. Then Gurli will inherit all I possess.
Sam. —(Extremely delighted.) —Your most obedient servant. All doubts are at an end; and Mr. Samuel Tradely boldly enters on the holy state of matrimony. Sign, Gurli.
Gurli. Well, I will sign; but if you say hold or stop again, I'll throw the ink-stand at your head.
Trad. And you will treat him properly.
Sam. Sign, Gurli, sign.
(As Gurli dips her pen in the ink,) Enter Robert and Jack . Gurli lets her hand fall, and gazes intently at Robert. Robert. [375]   Zounds! A large assembly!
Jack. Not the right sort for us, Sir. Put about ship.
Robert. Blockhead, I am not a woman-hater.
Sam. Brother, you are just come in time to sign your name as a witness to my marriage-contract.
Robert. With all my heart! I wish you joy.
Trad. Robert, here stands a worthy man, who will soon belong to our family.

[Page 68]
Robert. I am glad to hear it. I am not fond of compliments. Your hand, Sir!— (Shakes it.) —If it be true that you are a worthy man, I am your friend.
Cab. Friendship is the blossom of a moment, and the fruit of time.
Robert. True, very true. What ripens before its proper season, is shaken down by the first breeze.
Gurli. —(Inquisitively to Lydia.) —Who is that man?
Lydia. That is my brother Robert.
Gurli. Brother Robert! I like brother Robert.
Robert. Is this the intended bride?— (Approaches her.) —Allow me a salute, Madam.
Gurli. A dozen if you like.
                                         [Kisses him. Sam. Now, Gurli, sign the deed.
Staff. The formalities are protracted to too great an extent.
Sam. —(Impatiently to Gurli.) —Is it agreeable to sign [400]   the deed?
(Gurli shakes her head.) Mrs. T. —(Half aside.) —This is the most tedious scene I ever witnessed.
Gurli. Lydia, I'll tell you what. I like brother Robert better than brother Samuel.
Lydia. Silly girl!
Cab. Gurli, this is childish.
Gurli. Don't be angry, dear father. Gurli may chuse whom she likes, mayn't she?
Cab. Undoubtedly.
Gurli. Well then, Lydia, is it the same to you whether Gurli marries brother Samuel or brother Robert?
Lydia. —(Laughing.) —To me it is, dear Gurli, but not to Samuel.
Gurli. Oh, the silly man! Who would ask him?— (Goes to Robert.) —Dear brother Robert, will you be so good as to marry me?

[Page 69]
Robert. —(Very much astonished.) —How! What?
Staff. A most singular case, this!
Mrs. T. C'est unique.
Hurry. Quick as thought!
Sam. I am petrified.
Trad. —(With a smile to Caberdar.) —One of my sons will be the happy man. To me it is immaterial which.
Cab. —(Significantly.) —To me it is not immaterial.
Gurli. [425]   Well, you don't answer me.
Robert. Zounds! What can I answer?
Gurli. Don't I please you?
Robert. Yes, that you do.
Gurli. Well, and you please me. You are such a droll man. I like your laughing eyes. Your eyes speak so, that I feel as if I wanted to answer, and can't tell what. Well!
Robert. Why, Ma'am, I don't know you at all. I never saw you in my life till to-day.
Gurli. Nor I you. But Gurli would like to see you always.
Lydia. Brother, you may venture at my risk.
Robert. Zounds! She really is a pretty girl, but I can't deceive her. Ma'am, I am a poor devil, worth nothing but a ship of twelve hundred tons. If I put to sea to-morrow, I may be at the bottom of it next day.
Gurli. You shall not put to sea. You shall stay with Gurli.
Robert. And starve with Gurli.
Cab. Sir, this circumstance is singular in its way, and must surprise you extremely. This girl is my daughter. She is a good open child of nature, and her fortune is ten thousand pounds. I have nothing further to say.
Robert. Sir, I think no more of ten thousand pounds than of a rotten plank, and should not like to subsist [450]   entirely on another's fortune.
Gurli. Oh, you dear man, marry me.— (Strokes his cheek.) —I'll love you so much.

[Page 70]
Robert. —(Laughing.) —This is a silly business. Well! With all my heart!
Gurli. —(Delighted.) —Thank you. Let me kiss you.
Sam. Robert, is it acting like a brother thus to deprive me of my happiness?
Robert. Damnation! No, No, Ma'am, I can't marry you.
Gurli. —(Sorrowfully.) —Why not?
Robert. My brother has previous pretensions to you.
Gurli. Your brother is a fool.
Sam. Softly, Miss Gurli. Have not you promised a hundred times that you would marry me?
Gurli. Whether exactly a hundred times I don't know, but I have promised.
Sam. Brother, you hear how the matter stands.
Robert. I do. No, Ma'am—I resign.
Gurli. But I won't have him; I won't have him; I won't have him. You silly Samuel, what do you want with Gurli? Gurli won't have you.
Robert. That is immaterial to me. You may do as you please; but I am his brother, and the devil take me if I can marry you.
Gurli. Tell me the truth. Do you like me?
Robert. [475]   By my soul I do.
Gurli. Well, then you must marry me. Lydia, tell him so.
Lydia. A sister can but advise and intreat, not command.
Gurli. Who can command him, then?— (To Tradely.) —You are his father, command him to marry me.
Trad. Does not Gurli know from her own father, that in such cases children are allowed to follow their inclinations?
Gurli. Then ask him to marry me. When my father asks me to do any thing, I always do it directly. Ask him, dear Sir, ask him.— (As she is dancing round him, and stroking his cheeks, she accidentally hits his gouty leg.)

[Page 71]
Trad. Oh! Oh! Oh! My leg! My leg! Oh!
Gurli. —(Alarmed, and grieved.) —Don't be angry. Gurli did not do it on purpose.
Trad. Lydia, help me from this crowd. I am surrounded by so many people, and nothing will come to a termination. Away with me!
Cab. —(To Lydia.) —Allow me to accompany you.
Lydia. With great pleasure.
                                         [They push the chair off. Gurli. —(Much afflicted.) —I hit the poor sick old man's leg. I'm sure Gurli did not do it on purpose.
Mrs. T. Ha! Ha! Ha! The denouement of the scene has amused me a little.
Staff. I never witnessed such sponsalia in the whole course of my practice.
Hurry. [500]   If other measures be not speedily and rapidly taken—
Robert. The whole affair will end in nothing.
Jack. —(To Robert.) —You have run foul of Mr. Samuel, and spoilt his voyage.
Sam. The blood is congealed in my veins. In what a labyrinth have I involved myself by mere caution!
Gurli. —(To Robert.) —Well, sulky man! Have you determined whether you will marry me?
Robert. You seem to be a good girl. You love Lydia as affectionately as if she were your sister—don't you?
Gurli. Yes, that I do.
Robert. Let us suppose, then, that Lydia wanted to marry a good honest man, could you take him from her?
Gurli. No, that I never could.
Robert. And yet you require that I should play my brother such a trick.
Gurli. Do you love silly Samuel as much as I love Lydia?
Robert. —(Hesitating a little.) —He is my own brother.
Gurli. Oh dear, that's a pity. Gurli must cry.
                                         [Weeps.
[Page 72]
Jack. There's bad weather brewing. The sea runs damned hollow.
Staff. From what has happened, it is natural to infer and conclude, that my presence here is unnecessary. I [525]   hasten, therefore—
Sam. Stay, stay, Mr. Staff.
Staff. For what reason? My time is of too much consequence to be lost. I shall place this attendance to your account; and have the honour to be the company's most obedient humble servant.
                                         [Exit. Mrs. T. Ha! Ha! Ha! Thus the affair ends, then. Such ever be the fruits of ignoble intentions.
                                         [Exit. Sam. —(After a pause.) —One question very naturally occurs on this occasion. What must I do? Answer: I don't know.
                                         [Exit. Jack. The deck clears apace, Sir.— (Pointing to Hurry, who is observing what passes very inquisitively.) —There's one yonder yet.
Robert. Point the great guns at him.
Jack. —(To Hurry.) —My good fellow, hoist sail, and steer out of this room.
Hurry. Hold your tongue, if you please. I am here on the duties of my office.
Robert. The duties of your office! How long has my father's house been the custom-house?
Hurry. Understand me properly, Sir. It belongs to the duties of my office to serve my worthy comptroller Mr. Samuel Tradely. As often as I can steal a quarter of an hour, or even a minute, or even a second, from the custom-house, quick, quick as thought I hasten hither.
Robert. [550]   And now I beg, Sir, that quick, quick as thought you will hasten thither, or to any other place you like.
Hurry. But if I might know why—
Jack. Because I happen to have a damned itching in my fingers' ends.

[Page 73]
Hurry. Then you will probably not be offended if I take my leave immediately?
Robert. Not in the least. The sooner the better.
                                         [Exit Hurry. Jack. Now, Sir, what say you? Won't it be better, if old Jack casts anchor without, and waits till you give him a signal?
Robert. No, you may stay.— (To Gurli, who during the late conversation has been standing in a corner, and weeping.) —What do you want, Ma'am?
Gurli. A husband.
Robert. Marry my brother Samuel, then.
Gurli. I don't like him. I'll have you.
Robert. But why exactly me?
Gurli. That I don't know myself. You are a bad man; for you make me cry; and yet I love you. For many weeks I have felt as if I wanted something, and my father said Gurli was to marry. Well, Gurli wanted to marry too; and then my father asked what man I would have. That was all the same to Gurli; but since Gurli saw you, it is not all the same to her.
Robert. [575]   And scarcely to me, I think.
Gurli. Oh, marry me. I'll love you more than my parrot or my cat. I'll play with you like my cat, and feed you like my parrot.
Robert. To be pleased and fed by you, dear Gurli, is indeed no bad peep into futurity.
Gurli. Oh! how happily we will live together, you and I, father and parrot, Lydia and cat!
Robert. Yes, yes, if but—Damnation! I feel as if I were not acting honourably. Your sweet prattle will lull my conscience to sleep. Hark you, Gurli! Can you tell a lie?
Gurli. Tell a lie! What's that?
Robert. To say one thing, and think another.
Gurli. Ha! Ha! Ha! No, Gurli can't do that. But if you like, I'll learn.

[Page 74]
Robert. Heaven forbid! Tell me honestly, if brother Robert be determined on no account whatever to marry you, will you take Samuel?
Gurli. No, never. Gurli won't marry silly Samuel. Gurli can't bear him now.
Robert. But—damn it—to undermine my brother is too bad. Jack, what think you? Can an honest fellow take this prize with a good conscience?
Jack. You must know best how much water your frigate draws. But as to your brother, Sir, I should make no more [600]   of him than of a mouldy biscuit. He struts on the main deck with a fine coat, and such like; but damn me if I would advise an honest lass to let him come on board.
Robert. I think so too, Jack. The poor innocent girl would have but a poor passage through life. Enough, Gurli, I'll marry you.
Gurli. —(Falls on his neck.) —Now you are my dear brother Robert. Now Gurli can laugh and skip and dance again.
Robert. Stop. You are now engaged to me, and I must give you a ring. It is only plain gold, and not worth much, but it signifies as much as the Pitt in our King's treasury.
Gurli. What am I to do with it?
Robert. Put it on your finger. There! that signifies I love you.
Gurli. Ha! Ha! Ha! You droll man! I'll fetch you a ring too, and that signifies I love you again.
                                         [Exit into her chamber. Robert. Jack, what think you? Am I safely moored, or am I among the rocks?
Jack. Cast the lead into your own heart.
Robert. But she's a fine girl, Jack, eh? How the devil did she contrive to bring me so soon under her stern?
Jack. That I can't tell, Sir. I was not at the helm, and have nought to do with the ship's course.

[Page 75]
Robert. [625]   Nevertheless, honest messmate, I should like to hear the length and breadth of your opinion. We have doubled many a cape, and weathered many a gale together. You know my inside and outside, as well as you know your hammock. You used to carry me in your arms before I could splice a cable. Tell me candidly what you think of this business. The girl is pretty, good, and has ten thousand pounds.
Jack. Why yes, she's a tight lass enough, that understands her compass, well rigged aloft, and well planked below, but—
Robert. But what? Out with it!
Jack. Why women (God help 'em) are as they are. If I were in your place, Sir, I should say: I see well enough where the land lies, but damn me if I won't sail past the point.
Robert. I can't, Jack. I have carried away my tackle.
Jack. That's a bad job.
Robert. I almost fear my keel will turn out of water.
Jack. That's a very bad job. Then you are sure to founder.
Robert. I trust not, Jack; I still hope to continue in calm water. The girl carries her soul in her eye, and in her eye is no guile. Her heart is in her words, and her words are as sweet as the cocoa-nut.
Jack. [650]   But a wife is no more to be trusted to than a hurricane. At first you may lead a life of fun; but sail once against her inclinations, and the storm will blow from north, south, east and west. Then, consider, Sir. Now you govern your own vessel as you like. You weigh anchor when you like, and steer where you like. Do you think, if you take a wife on board, that you will have as much cable as before?
Robert. Silence, honest Jack. I find I was not serious when I asked your advice; for, in spite of all your objections, I am resolved to pursue my own course.
Jack. Luck be with you!

[Page 76]
Enter Fazir . Robert. At last, messmate, we are allowed a sight of you again. Where the deuce have you hid yourself since we drank a glass together?
Fazir. I have been on board. I had resolved never to enter this house again, and yet I am here again. I know not how it happens.
Robert. You have been on board, have you? Is the crew merry?
Fazir. Too much so. Their merriment drove me away, for I could not join in it.
Robert. But why not?
Fazir. How can you ask, Robert? I have a silly story to tell you. I went and threw myself into my hammock, [675]   and tried to find repose; but the rope by which my hammock is suspended from the deck—now, don't laugh at me.
Robert. No, no. Go on.
Fazir. Well—the knot of the rope has formed an L. It looks like an L, I assure you.
Robert. Yes, yes. Love is able to make it look like the whole alphabet.
Fazir. How did I rejoice, at sea, when on waking I beheld this L! My thoughts wandered further than my eyes, and this L kept me many an hour in bed. Alas! to-day, for the first time, it has driven me from my bed.
Robert. Poor fellow! What think you, Jack? Is there any help for him?
Jack. He is too heavily laden. He must throw love overboard, or he'll sink.
Fazir. Robert, shall you sail again soon?
Robert. Why, I have not yet begun to deliver my rums and sugars, and afterwards I must procure another freight outwards.
Fazir. How long shall you stay here, then?

[Page 77]
Robert. Six weeks at least.
Fazir. Six weeks! Oh, Robert! long before that time Fazir will be dead. Why did I not remain in my native land? There I might at least have perished with my [700]   brothers: here I must die alone. There some good soul would have lamented my fate: here, no one will drop a tear upon my grave.
Robert. Fazir, you distress me. If it be any consolation to you that Lydia's future husband seems to be a very worthy man—
Fazir. That ought to be some consolation to me, but it is not. Am not I a worthy man?
Robert. But you are not rich.
Fazir. Robert, have I not often heard you say that honesty was better than wealth?
Robert. Most certainly it is; but honesty gnaws at the bones which wealth throws under the table.
Fazir. Yet still—still I feel as if I never should have starved at Lydia's side. Do you remember the negro slave whom we saw on our walk at Jamaica? He was working in a sugar-plantation. The sweat ran from his brow—a pitcher of water stood near him—and yet he was cheerfully singing. “Good friend,” said you to him, “that is hard work.” “It is,” he replied, and wiped away the sweat with his bare hand. We entered into conversation, and asked him, among other things, how in his severe situation he could smile with so much satisfaction. He pointed to a bush at the distance of about a hundred paces, under which sat a black woman, [725]   with three half-naked children. The youngest lay upon her breast. And when the negro slave pointed thither, he looked so truly happy—Such a smile never decked the countenance of a king! Oh, had Lydia been willing, Fazir would have toiled like that slave—and would have smiled like that slave.

[Page 78]
Robert. —(Much affected.) —Come! Come! Let us drink a bottle of wine together.
Fazir. No. I don't like either to eat or drink. I will starve myself to death.
Enter Gurli , with a diamond ring. Gurli. Well! here I am!— (Espies Fazir, stands rooted to the spot, and surveys him with speechless dread. Fazir is equally alarmed at the sight of her, and rivets his eye upon her with a look of astonishment and terror.)
Robert. Well! What means all this?
Gurli. —(Trembling.) —Brother Robert, do you see any thing standing there?
Robert. To be sure I do.
Gurli. Do you really see it?
Robert. Why, yes. I am not blind.
Fazir. Robert, do you see that spirit?
Robert. I see a fool, and you are he.
Fazir. Dear Robert, that body once belonged to my sister Gurli. Ask it what soul has taken possession of it since her death.
Robert. Your sister!
Gurli. Yes, yes, Robert. That spirit's name was formerly Fazir. He was my brother—Oh, my dear brother!
Robert. [750]   I comprehend this. Children, keep your five senses together. First such alarm, and now such joy! You are not spirits. Children, I beseech you, don't be ridiculous. Embrace each other! Brother Fazir and sister Gurli!
Fazir and Gurli. —(Together.) —Not spirits!
                                         [They approach each other with open arms. Fazir. Are you really alive, Gurli?
Gurli. Are you alive, dear Fazir?
Robert. —(Deeply affected.) —What think you, Jack?
Jack. —(Wiping away a tear.) —Land! Land!

[Page 79]
Robert. Right, Jack. Never have I felt this, when I first espied land after a long and dangerous voyage.
Fazir and Gurli. —(Suddenly breaking out into excessive transports.) —He lives! She lives! Sister Gurli! Brother Fazir!
[Here the author can give no instruction to the actors. They hop, dance, skip, sing, laugh and cry alternately. Joy is always difficult to be acted, but most especially the transports of two uncorrupted children of nature. Robert and Jack silently survey and feast upon the blissful scene.] Enter Ganem . Ganem. I hear your voice, Gurli—But—what—
Fazir. Ganem too!
Ganem. Fazir! Thou alive!— (Presses him with fervour to his breast.) —How is this? Were am I? My old head—Yes, yes, he is alive.— (Transported.) —We will rejoice, we will rejoice. We will boil rice and milk.— (Raising his clasped hands, and bowing thrice to the earth.) —Praise be unto Brama! Praise be unto Brama! Where is my master? Where is Caberdar? We will paint the horns of a cow, and decorate them with garlands.
Fazir. Caberdar! What says he? Gurli, is my father too alive?
Gurli. [775]   Alive and well! Alive and well! Father! Father!
Fazir. —(With eager affection.) —Where? Where?
Enter Mrs. Tradely, Caberdar , and Tradely , whose chair is pushed in by Samuel . Mrs. T. —(As she enters.) — Ciel & mon dieu! What a vulgar riot!
Cab. —(Espying his son.) —Almighty Powers! What do I see?
Fazir. —(Embracing his knees.) —My father!

[Page 80]
Gurli and Ganem. —(Dancing round them.) —He is alive! He is alive!
Cab. —(Embracing his son with ardent affection.) —Thou art alive! Oh, Brama, canst thou forgive my doubts and my complaints? My first-born is alive! I clasp him in my arms! I have my son again! What can a prince's wealth or a prince's diadem bestow, to be compared with this moment?
Ganem. —(Bowing to the earth.) —Praise be unto Brama!
Cab. —(Raising his hands and eyes towards Heaven.) —Accept my silent thanksgiving.
Trad. What a blissful moment! It allays my pain.
Mrs. T. A romance; a complete romance.
Sam. So it seems to me too. I am still very doubtful whether it be true.
Robert. Give yourself no trouble, brother; I will be surety for the truth of it.
Cab. Speak, my son. By what miracle didst thou escape our butchers?
Fazir. I wandered to and fro, but some good angel [800]   directed my steps. I knew not whither I was going, nor what would become of me. On every side I was pursued without knowing it. On every side I escaped without knowing it. Brama has preserved me.
Ganem. —(Bows to the earth.) —Praise be unto Brama!
Fazir. On the tenth day after my escape from the palace, when hunger and fatigue had almost overpowered me, I with difficulty climbed a hill, and suddenly beheld before me the immeasurable ocean. A vessel had just sailed, and was scarcely a cannon-shot from the shore. Alas, thought I, had I but arrived an hour sooner, this vessel would have rescued me from every danger. I hastily untied my turban, and waved the muslin in the air. I called as loud as I was able, but in vain. A fresh breeze carried the ship away, and left me to despair. Hunger led me to the shore, where I sought,
[Page 81]
shell-fish, heedless whether any one discovered me. Suddenly (what a joyful sight!) I espied behind a rock, another vessel lying at anchor, whose commander was this worthy man.— (Pointing to Robert.) —To him I am obliged for the preservation of my life, and for my subsistence to this hour.
Ganem. —(Bowing to the earth.) —Praise be unto Brama!
Gurli. —(Runs to Robert, and throws her arms round his neck.) —Oh, you good dear man!
Robert. Pshaw!
Cab. —(Shaking Robert's hand.) [825]   —Sir, should you ever be a father, you will then feel that for such a kindness the gratitude of a parent has no words.
Robert. By my soul, Sir, I am ashamed. When I received the young man, I neither thought of gratitude nor recompence. I followed the dictates of my heart, and found I had preserved a friend.
Trad. Embrace me, my son. Heaven bless you!
Mrs. T. —(Giving him her hand.) — Mon fils , I am enchanted with your noble sentiments.
Robert. Dear mother, my sentiments were at that moment so little noble, that I even fear envy and jealousy were among them. On the previous evening, three other fugitives had saved their lives in the vessel which lay near me, and by my soul I lamented that accident had led them to my neighbour.
Cab. Those three fugitives were we. That worthy man saved the father, the daughter, and the friend. This worthy man restores to me my son.
Gurli. And Gurli may marry this good man—mayn't she, father?
Cab. If he agree to it, with all my heart!
Gurli. Yes. You'll have me. Won't you, Robert?
Robert. —(To Samuel.) —Brother, you must not take it amiss. My generous resignation of her would be of no
[Page 82]
[850]   service to you, for she declares that at all events she will not marry you.
Gurli. No, that I won't, silly Samuel; so go away.
Sam. One question naturally occurs on this occasion: What must Mr. Samuel Tradely do? Hang himself— if caution would allow it. Who knows whether there be not some still greater happiness in store for him?
                                         [Exit. Cab. Every thing conspires to prove that I gained nothing when chance placed in my hand the sceptre of Mysore, and that I lost nothing when chance again wrested it from me. With good children, and worthy friends, what can be wanting to complete my happiness? A wife. That too I have found. Madam, your consent alone is wanting. I love your daughter. I know your sentiments, and your respect for ancient families. I hope all your demands in this respect will be satisfied, when I assure you that I was the reigning monarch of Mysore, and that my forefathers bore arms with honour when Alexander the Great subdued India.
Mrs. T. I am astonished. So old a house! I shall be proud of receiving you into the family with open arms.
Fazir. Alas, my father!
Cab. What now?
Fazir. My dear father!
Cab. What is the matter, my dear son?
Fazir. [875]   You have given me life, and are about to rob me of it.
Cab. I do not understand you.
Fazir. I love Lydia so sincerely.
Cab. Indeed! And Lydia?
Fazir. I have no repose by day or night.
Cab. Hear me, my dear boy. Lydia alone can decide this. True it is, you are but twenty years of age, and the fresh bloom of youth adorns your cheek. I, on the
[Page 83]
contrary, bear on my back the load of thirty-five. Yet, as far as I am able to judge of Lydia's mind, this will scarcely influence her choice. We will summon her, and if her heart decide for you, I willingly submit to my fate.
Robert. Jack, weigh anchor, and steer to Lydia's room. Tell her we will thank her to sail hither.
Jack. I will, Sir.
                                         [Exit. Gurli. Father, I can tell you which Lydia will marry.
Cab. Well?
Gurli. My brother Fazir.
Cab. How can you know that?
Gurli. He is prettier than you.
Cab. My dear girl, Lydia is not a child like you.
Robert. I fear, as far as relates to this point, women will be children all their lives.
Trad. Happen what may, I shall at least see two [900]   happy couples before my end.
Mrs. T. True, mon cher . This day reconciles me to fortune, and softly shall I hereafter slumber with my ancestors. I am only grieved for Samuel's fate.
Gurli. Poor silly Samuel! I am really sorry for him. What do you think, Robert? I'll marry him too.
Robert. Two husbands at once! No, Gurli, I must beg you not to do that.
Gurli. Well, as you like.
Enter Lydia and Jack . Robert. Sister, I wish you joy of your approaching marriage.
Lydia. —(Dejected.) —I thank you.
Robert. But to whom are you about to be married? That is still the question.
Lydia. To whom! To this gentleman.
                                         [Pointing to Caberdar.
[Page 84]
Robert. Hold! Hold! Not in such haste!
Cab. Miss Lydia, I release you from your promise. A father and his son stand before you.
Lydia. —(Astonished.) —Father and son!
Cab. Yes. This youth is my son. He loves you. I love you too. Make a free choice.
Gurli. Take Fazir. He is prettier than my father.
Cab. Your heart must decide.
Lydia. —(Much confused.) —My heart! Oh!
Fazir. —(With downcast eyes.) —Dear Miss Lydia—
Robert. [925]   Well, sister, what do you say?
Lydia. What can I say? I have already given my word.
Cab. Then if you had not given your word, you would— (Lydia is silent.) —I understand you— (Lays her hand in Fazir's.) —God bless you, children!
Fazir. —(Embracing Lydia.) —Dearest Lydia!
Ganem. —(Bowing to the earth.) —Praise be unto Brama!
Cab. —(Wipes away a tear.) —A single bitter drop! It is but just. The cup of joy was too sweet.
Robert. Well, Jack! What think you?
Jack. I think that I must tow my old battered hull round the world alone. Powder and shot are gone. The main-deck is carried away. What can I do?
Robert. You shall stay with me; and as long as I have a biscuit, the half of it is your's, till at length you reach the end of your voyage, and are received among the crew aloft.
Jack. I thank you, Sir; I thank you. Well! I wish you all good weather, and a fair wind on the passage.

SHAKSPEARE'S EARLY DAYS: AN HISTORICAL PLAY, In Two Acts, As performed at the THEATRES ROYAL, LONDON.
[Page 5]
Front matter
REMARKS. Shakspeare's Early Days. In those day-dreams of fancy which persons of a certain temperament are wont to indulge, we have pictured to our imagination Shakspeare and his times. His majestic countenance, from the contemplation of which Dryden caught inspiration, has been rudely, yet faithfully preserved; his mind is best seen in his works. On the few incidents recorded in his life, we dwell with fond enthusiasm. His boyhood, courtship, marriage— his wild exploits in the park of Sir Thomas Lucy, (the scene of “As you like it,”)—his bitter lampoon on the “Parliament Member,”—his retreat from Stratford; arrival in London; accidental encounter with the players,—his appearance as an actor and author,—and the first dawning of his mighty genius. That the muse had vouchsafed him her inspirations, and opened to his infant eyes the gates of immortality; that she had haunted his visions by day, and his dreams by night, is not the fiction of an idle brain, but an inference fully warranted by events:—

“Genius! too meanly priz'd on earth,
Immortal star of heavenly birth!
How dazzling shine thy morning beams;
What ardent hopes, what golden dreams,
And summer prospects, fondly cheer
Thy bright, eccentric, wild career!” 1 In disgrace and penury, the world before him, but its prospects gloomy and uncertain, Shakspeare quitted his native town, his family, and kindred. His feelings who shall imagine? who shall describe? We should say they partook of melancholy mingled with hope, relieved by the curiosity of a young and ardent adventurer strong in the emotions of genius; anticipating a wider field for the exercise of his talents; and not without some partial glimpses of “The All Hail Hereafter!” If such were his aspirations, never was vision more prophetic.
In aid of this illusion, his contemporaries pass in review
[Page 6]
before us—Elizabeth, “the expectancy and rose of the fair state;” the gallant Southampton, “the observ'd of all observers;” the rare Ben Jonson, and his Fellows , Alleyn, Armin, Burbage, Green, and that prince of clowns, Dick Tarlton, whose true effigies have passed to posterity, and enough of whose history remains to give us some insight into their characters. Their very places of resort, convivial and theatrical, though for the most part destroyed by time, are transmitted to us by the graver's art; and so minutely has description set forth each particular, that we pace the deserted chambers of the Falcon and the Devil—we hear the wisdom and the wit, and the loud laugh—we visit the Bear Garden, the Globe, and the Fortune—we listen to Tarlton, with his wondrous, plentiful, pleasant, extemporal humour, exchanging gibes with our merry ancestors:—

“Friend or foe, if thou wilt needs know, mark me well,—
With parting dogs and bears, then by the ears, this chance fell:
But what of that? Though my nose be flat, my credit to save,
Yet very well I can by the smell scent an honest man from a knave”— we behold Burbage , such a player “as no age must look to see the like,” in his original character of the crafty Richard—Maister Greene , than whom “there was not an actor of his nature, in his time, of better ability in performance of what he undertook, more applaudent by the audience, of greater grace at the court, or of more general love in the Citty,” in his crack part of Bubble, “Tu Quoque !”—the merry and frolicsome Bob Armin , in simple John, in the Hospitall —and

“ Alleyn , playing Faustus ,
With the cross upon his breast.” The age of Skakspeare was the age of romance—

“Of pomp, and feast, and revelry,
With mask and antique pageantry;
Such sights as youthful poets dream
On summer eves by haunted stream.” As yet, frigid philosophy had not reduced man's existence to one dull round of sad realities; but some magical drops were distilled in the cup, to make the bitter draught of life go down. Shakspeare had drank deep at this fountain of inspiration; hence the high-toned sentiment, the noble enthusiasm, the perfect humanity,
[Page 7]
that makes the heart tremble, and the tears start, in the works of this mighty enchanter. The age, too, was a joyous one,—the puritanical ravings of Gosson and Stubbes , and the snarling of Prynne , had not disinclined the people to their ancient sports and pastimes; and England, in her holydays and festivals, well deserved her characteristic appellation of “Merrie.” These national peculiarities were not lost on a mind so excursive as Shakspeare's:—his works abound in curious illustrations of the domestic habits and popular superstitions of our ancestors; and he who has attentively studied them may claim more credit for antiquarian knowledge, than is generally conceded to the readers of fiction and fancy.—From all that we can learn of his personal history, his disposition was bland, cheerful, and humane; by one who best knew him, and who has been most unjustly and invidiously brought forward as an adversary, he is styled the “gentle Shakspeare.” —He possessed that happy temperament so beautifully described in Hamlets character of Horatio:

                                         “For thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bless'd are those,
Whose blood and judgment are so well co-mingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please.” He loved the merry catch and the mirth-inspiring glee, —the wine and wassail, the cakes and ale, which warmed the hearts of that immortal trio, Sir Andrew, Sir Toby, and the Clown, and extracted from the taciturn Master Silence those precious relics of old ballad poetry that erst graced the collection, “fair wrapt up in parchement, and bound with a whipcord,” of that righte cunninge and primitive bibliographer, Captain Cox, of Coventry!—And how deeply has he struck the chords of melancholy!—yet, no marvel thereat; since there never was a true poet, who did not feel the presence of this sublime spirit—a spirit that dwelt in Shakspeare, in all its intensity:—

“To him the mighty mother did unveil
Her awful face; the dauntless child
Stretch'd forth his little arms and smil'd.
This pencil take (she said), whose colours clear,
Richly paint the vernal year:
[Page 8]

Thine, too, these golden keys, immortal boy!
This can unlock the gates of joy;
Of horror, that, and thrilling fears,
Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears.” Shakspeare did not wait for the sear, the yellow leaf, ere he bade a final adieu to the theatre of his glory. If ever pride became a virtue, it was that which glowed in the poet's bosom at this auspicious moment. Of fame he possessed a greater share than ever fell to the lot of human being.—A splendid retirement was before him;—

“And that which should accompany old age,
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends.” With what emotions must he have revisited that sacred pile, the last object where he might have fondly lingered, when he went forth a wanderer!—Too soon it was to become his mausoleum—the shrine of adoring votaries, through distant ages; who, led thither by the divine spirit of his muse, account it no idolatry to bow before the dust of Shakspeare.
The present age, so fertile in inventions, has exhibited Shakspeare in propriâ personâ on the scene where he was once illustrated in all his glory. The attempt was a bold one:—

“The daring youth that fir'd th' Ephesian dome
Outlives in fame th' ambitious fool that rear'd it.” The author has performed his task with reasonable success.—Shakspeare, for the most part, speaks his own language; the other personages are not offensively prominent,—they do not o'erstep the modesty of nature. The scenery is a rich antiquarian treat,—Shakspeare's house at Stratford—a view of the town, and the mansion and park, of Charlcotte—the Falcon Tavern at Bankside, and the Globe Theatre.—The illusion was perfect.—Shakspeare was represented by Mr. Charles Kemble; and to whom could The Immortal be assigned with greater propriety, than to this superb actor and accomplished gentleman? The other characters were well supported—Bartley in Sir Thomas Lucy, Blanchard in Dr. Orthodox, and J. Russell in Slyboots, deserve particular commendation.

[Page 9]
A word for the author,—Mr. Somerset is an indefatigable labourer in the dramatic field— but he has not received the encouragement that is due to his industry; and, we may justly add, to his genius. When we consider the very small modicum of talent that is necessary to constitute a successful playwright in the present day, we cannot but marvel that he should lack advancement;— is it, that he possesses not the accommodating spirit necessary to conciliate actors , or those splendid “ annuals,” lessees ?—We suspect that it is.—In our critical vocation, we have hardly met with a more deserving author (among the moderns ), than Mr. Somerset. He is, (we understand) what very few of his brethren are, a scholar ; he is, also, what most scholars ever have been —poor. This is a melancholy reflection, and we write it with bitterness. At ignorance and presumption, we delight to point a shaft—a good cloth-yard, and more; but merit pining in poverty and neglect demands our helping hand, and shall have it;—in such a case, we would desire to soften, if not to retract, our censure:—

“But if the muse, too cruel in her mirth,
With harsh reflections, wounds the man of worth,
Asham'd she marks the sentence with a blot,
And hates the line where candour was forgot.” D.—G.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. —Exterior of the House of John Shakspeare, wool-stapler, of Stratford upon Avon, in which our immortal bard was born. Enter John Shakspeare , followed by Mary , his wife, D. F. John S. Prithee now, dame, seek not to justify such loose behaviour—I tell thee, our boy Willy hath not been home all night.
Mary S. Mayhap not, goodman John; yet do I, though his mother, feel no uneasiness, being assured that none but the very best of company hath kept Willy from home; for he hath noble blood in his veins—that is, on his mother's side: ay, marry, that he hath!
John S. Tush! noble blood, forsooth! noble nonsense! An he mind not his lawful calling and be thrifty in the wool-market, thereby proving himself more expert in the getting of money than in the lavishing thereof, what will his noble blood avail him? Is he not a loose, wild, hair-brained young spendthrift,—I tell thee, dame, his manner liketh me not; no, no! I say again, and again, his manner liketh me not!
Mary S. But it liketh me well, goodman John, to see my boy herd not with boors and clodpoles, but the rather with young gentles of good degree and spirit; thereby giving proof of his noble descent: for doth he not proceed in a direct line,—that is, on his mother's side, from the ancient and honourable stock of the Ardens? 3
John S. He doth, dame, I grant you; but what of
[Page 14]
that? Will the noble blood of the Ardens put money [25]   into his purse, an he hath none? Clothe him, an he lack raiment? Feed him, if he want food? Marry, not it,— but his lawful calling will: an he stick to that, the wool our sheep now wear on their backs, he may, one day even, transformed into a golden fleece, wear upon his own. Ergo, dame, talk not to me of noble blood, which taketh nobles out of a man's pocket, but of an honest, lawful calling, which putteth nobles into it.—Go to! go to! with all thy gentleness of blood, thou art but a silly-spoken woman.
Enter Gilbert Shakspeare , cracking nuts, R. Gil. S. (R.) Speed ye well, father and mother; a blessed morning to you both.
John S. (L.) Thanks, boy, thanks. [To Mary.] There now standeth before thine eyes, dame, a goodly ensample of honest, homely wisdom—our son Gilbert, unlike that scapegrace, his brother Willy, is ever plodding and thrifty in the wool-market—that boy lacks but his father's beard to be his father.
Mary S. (C.) And his brother Willy's head, to be his brother Willy.
John S. But I say, my boy Gilbert hath brains enough and to spare, were it needful, both to his elders and his betters.
Mary S. Mayhap; but he's no poet, like my boy Willy —no, no, goodman John, he's no poet.
John S. [50]   Since thou seem'st bent upon the rule of contrary, dame, Gilbert shall testify most amply unto thee, that he is a poet. [To Gilbert.] Come, boy, sing or say unto thy mother a stave of thine own rhyming, my pretty bird—jump from thy brain at once, without all cogitation.
Gil. S. Marry will I, father: anon— [Considering.] — anon—now give ear:—
[Spoken or sung, ad libitum.]
When to the village wake I go,
The girls with one accord, I vow,
Call me the stupidest of Gilberts,
Because I threaten to tell father,
If they should kiss me; for I'd rather
Sit in a corner, cracking filberts. Mary S. [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha! thy boy Gilbert is a rare poet, goodman John.—Ha, ha, ha! a rare poet!

[Page 15]
John S. Wisely spoken, my boy! by the mass! most sapiently spoken,—prithee tell me, son of mine, hast seen nought of thy scapegrace brother, Willy, this morning?
Gil. S. Nought, father; but a cowherd did even now assure me, the graceless crew of whom brother Willy was one, hath been at no better sport all night than deer-stealing in the park of Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcotte.
John S. Deer-stealing! there's poesy for you, dame: —and in the justice's park, too! [Crosses, L.] But, come; let us go seek this night-bird—this wild young wanton [75]   Willy,—my manhood on't, we find him in his cups.
Mary S. My womanhood on't, we find him in noble company.
Gil. S. My best nut-crackers on't, we find him not in the wool-market.
Mary S. No; nor his brains a wool-gathering, like thine.
John S. Would that they were; for then were his brains more thrifty than his fingers. But, come, let us seek our wanton Willy, come!
                                         [Exeunt, L., Gilbert, cracking a nut and shaking his head, seems to think his brother Willy's case beyond all cure. SCENE II. —An extensive and beautifully romantic landscape, on the Banks of the River Avon, near Stratford, which town is seen in the distance, the windows of its houses brilliantly illuminated by the rays of the rising-sun —the opening Music imitates the singing of birds— milk-white swans are seen gliding on the limpid stream, and all nature appears decked out in her gayest holiday attire. William Shakspeare , at this period twenty-one years of age, is discovered asleep upon a bank of flowers, C.— Aerial Music is heard, as Oberon and Titania are seen descending from the clouds, C. INVOCATION CHORUS of Invisible Sprights, 4 as the clouds are descending.
At great Oberon's command,
Over sea, and over land,
[Page 16]

Over hillock, over mountain,
Over lake, and over fountain,
Over rock, and over glen,
Over marsh, and over fen,
Over forest, over mead,
Hither haste, ye elves, with speed.                                          [The clouds open, and Oberon and Titania advance. RECITATIVO.— Titania , pointing to William Shakspeare.
The son of Genius, who now slumbers there,
Hath from his youth been our especial care;
In him there dwells a great and mighty soul,
Which, to display itself without control,
Must quit these dull and rustic scenes of life,
And learn to glow, where, in the noble strife
Of emulation, he may be caress'd,
And the world's brightest genius stand confess'd! Enter Fairies , R. and L. Oberon. —Allegro vivace.
Elves and Fairies all attend,
And haunt the slumbers of your friend;
One who shall, in after ages,
In his genius-glowing pages,
Tell of you, your tricks and fancies,
Your amours, and your romances. Tit.
Even now, mine eye doth ken
The magic power of his pen,—
[25]   Doth peruse in his sweet lays
Oberon and Titania's praise! Obe.
To your task, ye fairy elves. Tit.
Aid your minstrel! aid yourselves!
And in a vision, ere he wake,
Let his soul of joy partake!                                          [Oberon sounds his horn, when suddenly the clouds open, and Shakspeare's vision commences, the following groups and figures passing slowly before him as he slumbers.—Appropriate Music. First. Falstaff. Second. Richard the Third , in his tent, just startled from his sleep by the Ghosts. Third. Juliet waking in her tomb
[Page 17]
Fourth. Hamlet and Ghost , blue fire, with ramparts of the Castle, by moonlight. Fifth. Prospero, Miranda, Ariel , and Caliban , with distant view of shipwreek—green fire. Sixth. Macbeth and Witches , in the caldron scene—red fire.                                          [The several groups of Fairies, as this vision is passing, express by appropriate dancing and pantomime the subject of each apparition:—Thus, when Falstaff passes, they trip it nimbly, puffing their cheeks to show both the vivacity and corpulence of that witty knave—when Richard is passing, they march a-la-militaire—when Juliet appears, they seem dissolved with grief—the moonlight interview of Hamlet with the Ghost of his father, fills them with terror, and they hide their faces —Prospero's appearance, however, again cheers their spirits, and to Macbeth and the Witches they dance in the manner of those beldams—the vision having passed as before, the clouds close again. Obe.
Now, ye fairy elves, advance,
While our minstrel's in a trance,
And, that he in you may find
The creations of his mind,
Round him march, and round him dance,—                                          [Shakspeare makes a motion to awake.
He wakes! now hence! yet still be near—
As you came, so disappear!                                          [Oberon and Titania re-ascend to the invocation Music, da capo—chorus as before, to which the Fairies dance off, waving their wands over the slumbering bard.                                          [ William Shakspeare starts from sleep, looks around, and rushes forward, amazed. Wil. S. (R.)
Where am I? What have I seen?
Antic shapes, which eye of man
Till this moment ne'er did scan—
Forms that fancy still retains,
Though not one of them remains;—
And as they, in goodly numbers,
Pass'd me in my golden slumbers,
Methought I heard them all exclaim
“In Oberon and Titania's name!
Shakspeare, arise to deathless fame!”                                          [He stands wrapt in thought.
[Page 18]
Enter John, Mary , and Gilbert Shakspeare, l. s. e. Gil. S. (R. C.) This way, father and mother; this is his favourite haunt—verily, I'm right! yonder he stands, [50]   lost in deep cogitation, like unto one who dreameth with his eyes open.
John S. [Crossing to William.] Why, thou scapegrace! thou wild Willy, boy! answer thy father; where, and how didst thou pass the night?
Wil. S. [In ecstasy.] In paradise! with gods, and kings, and queens!
Mary S. Gods, kings, and queens! said I not my boy Willy had been in right honourable company:—hear'st thou, goodman John? Kings and queens!
Gil. S. [Who has crossed behind, R.] Queens, forsooth! pray heaven, they be not queans of the wrong sort.
John S. Surely, the boy is crazed!
Wil. S.
I tell thee, father, I have supp'd with gods!
Ambrosia was the food—nectar, the wine,
Which angel hands did serve for our regalement. John S. [To Gilbert.] Hie thee for a leech, boy! thy brother is mad—I'll have him blooded—fly, for thy life! bring hither a leech, I say!
Gil. S. [Crossing, L.] Anon, father, anon.
Mary S. [Detaining Gilbert.] Not a drop of his gentle blood shall my dear Willy lose—not a drop!
John S. [To Gilbert.] Wilt thou begone, sirrah?
Gil. S. I run, I fly!—yet, good brother Willy, prithee now, come back again to thy sober senses, ere the leech [75]   rob thee of thine honourable blood—come, prithee come with me to the wool-market?
Wil. S. (R.)
To the wool-market, say'st thou? And shall I,
Who heard but now the music of the spheres,
Go listen to the bleating of old rams? Gil. S. An' thou likest to hear the music of the shears, brother Willy, thine ear may have abundance thereof, seeing we begin sheep-shearing this very day.
Enter Slyboots , and two Followers, L. U. E. Sly. [To his Men.] Yonder he stands—now may we lay hands on him; yet with all gentleness and courtesy,
[Page 19]
in respect to his worthy father. [Comes down, R. C.] Hem! [To William.] Young man! or, rather, young gentleman, an' like ye, I have a word for your private ear, from his worship, Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcotte.
Wil. S. Be brief, my friend; for I dislike preamble.
Sly. As I e'en now premised—you are hereby summoned to appear [Produces a warrant.] instanter, before his worship, Sir Thomas Lucy, in whose park you last night shot a buck, and—
Wil. S. I understand; and am prepared to follow.
John S. Oh, Willy, Willy! and was Charlcotte Park the paradise, and Sir Thomas Lucy's deer the angels and goddesses, thou spak'st of even now? Alack-a-day! thou art a sad wild Willy!
Mary S. Judge not rashly, goodman John, until thou [100]   hear his worship's accusation.
Sly. With your leave, good Master Willy Shakspeare—
Wil. S. Since sovereign law commands, I will attend, And render an account.—Lead on, my friend!
Gil. S. Ah! this comes of keeping company with one's betters—gods, and kings, and queens: oh, dear!
                                         [Exeunt, L. SCENE III. —A Chamber in the Mansion of Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcotte—Antique table, R. C., and chairs brought on with several old folio law-books, pens, ink, &c. Enter Sir Thomas Lucy (a second Sir John Falstaff, for corpulence), followed by Drawl , his clerk, R. Sir T. Hem, hem! the arrant knave! to kill one of my fattest bucks, and in mine own park, too! wherefore did not my foresters take him in the very act, and cage the rogue all night? Wherefore did they not? Expound, good Drawl—expound!
Drawl. [In a tone corresponding with his name.] They did not, an't please your worship, because they could not—seeing, the depredator, young Master Willy Shakspeare, of Stratford, to the cunning of the fox, addeth the fleetness of the hare—in brief, he escaped his pursuers, an't please your worship.
Sir T. [Mocking him.] Marry, but it pleaseth us not, Master Drawl, no more than thy long-tongued manner of speech. [In his natural voice.] An' thou mend not
[Page 20]
thine utterance, we shall be constrained to provide us with another and more comprehensible clerk; seeing that the fairest words of the queen's English are most grievously marred and mangled by thy vile delivery thereof.
Sly. [Without, L.] This way. His Worship, Sir Thomas, is above. This way.
Sir T. [Ah!—That's a most welcome voice. So, Slyboots is returned, and with him that young poacher, I will hope; or, by the rotundity of our person! he shall [25]   eat no more poached eggs and bacon at Charlcotte Hall. An' he bring me not this vile slayer of bucks, I'll cage him, or I'm but the fraction of a man. Now, Drawl, open me the books of law; for we are never compos mentis, until we have chapter and verse before us.
                                         [Drawl opens the law-books, and takes his seat upon a stool, R. of the table; while Sir Thomas Lucy seats himself, in his large official chair, L. of the table— Drawl, perched, as it were, on his stool, and wearing large old-fashioned spectacles, mounted in copper, contrasts admirably with Sir Thomas, who, with all the self-consequence of magisterial dignity, added to personal animosity, prepares to examine the delinquent. Enter Slyboots and Followers, with William Shakspeare, John, Mary , and Gilbert Shakspeare, l. Sly. Here is the young gentleman, an't please your worship.
Sir T. Young gentleman, forsooth!—young nightbird! scapegrace! poacher! thou wouldst say:—but he shall rue his wantonness, or I'm a baby's shadow. [To John Shakspeare.] Hark ye! Master John Shakspeare, on your parole of honour: your boy, Willy, slept not at home last night?
John S. It grieveth my heart; but the truth must be confessed—he slept not under my roof last night, your worship.
Mary S. Yet did he pass the night with gods, and kings, and queens.
Gil. S. Yes, your worship, where he heard the music of the shears.
Sir T. [Surprised.] Kings! queens! and the music of the shears! Verily, good Master Drawl, it seemeth unto us as though we had to deal with madmen.

[Page 21]
Drawl. So seemeth it, indeed, most worshipful Sir Thomas.
Sir T. [50]   Yet will we soon restore them to reason. [To William Shakspeare.] Hem! how durst thou shoot a buck in our park, last night?
Wil. S. 'Twas in the forest—not your park, Sir Thomas.
Sir T. Explain! but dost thou hear?—nought but the truth; or, by the rotundity of our person, we'll have thee thumb-screwed—speak, coxcomb, speak!
Wil. S. I will obey, most worshipful Colossus.
Sir T. Colossus! why, thou ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, saucy varlet! know'st thou to whom thou speakest? Our name is not Colossus, but Sir Thomas Lucy.
Wil. S.
Nor is mine coxcomb, sir; but William Shakspeare.
I met the buck i' the forest, running wild,
And shot him, not for pastime, but for food.
I know 'tis theft to take a horse, or sheep,
Or any other beast, domesticated;
But a wild animal, such as a deer, or hare,
Can have no owner; tell me then, I pray you,
Most sapient justice, out of your vast wisdom,
Where is the sin in killing such a creature,
More than in plucking from a bush or tree
A nut or sloe, unclaimed of any man? Sir T. [Aside.] A shrewd young knave:—good Drawl, we are at fault; expound, expound!
Drawl. [To William Shakspeare—taking one of the folios.] [75]   Young man, thus saith the law,—“Certain brute beasts, albeit they do run wild, are noble in their nature, and may not be hunted or destroyed by any commoner.”
Mary S. But my boy Willy is no commoner; but a gentleman, every inch of him—that is, on his mother's side.
John S. Peace, dame; or thou wilt mar all, with thy tongue.
Sir T. Hem, hem! attention all! [To William Shakspeare.] If we do condescend to enter into exposition with a daring poacher, it proceeds from the natural sweetness of our lamb-like disposition; there not being one drop of gall in the whole of our somewhat substantial composition: thy youth and inexperience will we therefore instruct, out of our superabundant stock of wisdom. [Turns to Drawl and makes signs to him to open his book,
[Page 22]
and be ready to prompt if occasion require it.] Know, then, thou young scapegrace, the laws which empower us to chastise thee, were enacted by— [Turns to Drawl for information, who communicates it in a whisper.] hem! were enacted by that puissant monarch, Guilielmus Primus, who having subdued England, was surnamed the Conqueror.
Wil. S. If he did make such laws, he conquered more Than England.
Sir T.
Prithee, youngster, what besides? Wil. S.
[100]   Reason and common sense! for, where just Heaven
Hath set no mark or sign, whereby to ken
Why this beast should be noble and that not,
Shall puny man dare make a difference,
And punish him who takes what bounteous Providence
Gave, free as air, to rich and poor alike? Sir T. A pert young coxcomb! we are at fault again: expound the law, good Drawl, expound!
Drawl. [Aside.] Now, by the mass! I am clean puzzled, too. [To William Shakspeare.] Young man, such is the law; let that suffice.
Sir T. Ay, such is the law; [To William Shakspeare.] and thou hast no excuse; for, seeing thou lackest nought, thou canst not plead poverty, in extenuation of thy wantonness.
Wil. S.
It was not for myself I shot the buck,
For I receive at home, from my dear parents,
Both food and raiment, better than I merit. Sir T. Not for thyself, say'st thou? For whom else, pray?
Wil. S.
I'll tell your worship:—in a little cottage
By the wood-side, there dwells an humble shepherd:
A man, whose life, though spent in industry,
Hath ever been one tissue of misfortunes;
Disease destroyed his flocks, and poverty
[125]   Hath, from a man of substance, brought him down
To abject wretchedness. 'Twas yester even,
As in my wanderings I passed his cottage,
I heard a moan—a second struck mine ear;
And, entering the poor man's humble dwelling,
I there beheld a scene of wretchedness,
Too great for tongue to tell! Sir T.
I marvel at thy speech! proceed, young man. Wil. S.
His wretched wise, his helpless babes, himself,
[Page 23]

On the bare earth lay stretched!—their pallid cheeks,
Their sunken eyes, proclaimed the ruthless war,
Which nature then was waging 'gainst disease,
Hunger, and cold! her mortal enemies!
“Have you no food?” quoth I—
“None, for the last two days,” was their reply;—
Like one pursued by fiends, forth from the cottage
I madly rushed, resolved to bring them food!
My home I could not reach—it was too far;
I therefore shot the buck I chanc'd to meet,
And on my shoulders bore it off in triumph,
To the poor shepherd's dwelling;—there arriv'd,
I lit a fire—prepared some savoury broth
For the poor sufferers—tended them myself—
And when I saw their eyes beam joy again,
And heard them speak sweet words of gratitude,
[150]   And view'd the smiling infants all around me,
I thought them angels from the realms of light!—
Their cottage, paradise! myself in heaven!                                          [Turning to his father.
Thus, my dear father, did I pass the night. Mary S. My boy Willy deserves to be a Parliament member, for such a speech.
John S. [Crossing to William Shakspeare.] Much more for such humanity! thy hand, my brave boy,—I did thee wrong in thinking ill of thee.
Gil. S. [Half crying, going to William Shakspeare.] Let me embrace thee, brother Willy. Prithee, describe unto me where about dwelleth the poor shepherd and his wretched family, and I will send them, straight out of mine own means, a present of fleecy hosiery.
                                         [He treads accidentally on Sir Thomas Lucy's toe, at which his worship is highly incensed, and strikes at him with his cane. Sir T. [To Gilbert, who crosses behind to L.] Thou careless knave! Hem! [To William Shakspeare.] Young man, attend—thou hast done both well and ill.
Wil. S. And can a man do ill in doing well?
Sir T. Ay, marry, can he, as we'll prove—thou didst well to feed the hungry, but thou didst ill to feed them with venison, which is no food for peasants, but for lords.
Wil. S. And is that justice, sir?
Sir T. Such is the law.
Wil. S. Should law from justice e'er be separated?

[Page 24]
Sir T. Make an end, good Drawl, make an end, or this young coxcomb will clean confound us at last. If [175]   ever I beheld his equal, I'll be a baby's shadow.
Drawl. (R.) [Taking one of the folios.] Young man, attend: for the good which thou didst in feeding of the hungry, thou meritest commendation, but for the evil thou didst in shooting a buck—moreover, a buck appertaining unto his worship, Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcotte Hall—the law doth inflict the penalty of fifty crowns, or twelve months' imprisonment.
Sir T. The which sentence we do confirm.
John S. [Producing his purse.] Not a moment shall my brave boy pine in a dungeon's gloom. [Goes to the table, and gives a bag of money.] Here is the money.
Gil. S. [Going to the table, and paying money.] If, peradventure, thou hast not gotten money enough, father, I have three silver groats in the corner of my pocket— [Embracing William Shakspeare.] Anything for dear brother Willy.
                                         [Drawl receives the money, carefully examining the coin, and, finally depositing it in a canvass bag, puts it into his pocket. Wil. S. [To his father.] I promise ne'er again thus to offend.
John S. (R. C.) Every day, boy, an thou wilt: deeds of mercy and charity are at all times in season; but leave the shooting of bucks, in future, Willy, and if thou wilt at any time save a poor family from starving, take one of thy father's sheep to them—thou art heartily welcome.
Gil. S. Ay, marry, to the fattest of the whole flock, [200]   wool and all.
Wil S.
Thanks, my good brother; yet his worship here,
“Dress'd in a little brief authority,”
Hath punish'd me for pure humanity.
“In law, no plea so tainted and corrupt
“But, being season'd with a specious voice,
“Obscures the show of evil.”
Come, father, let us hence; the air is here
By far too foul for honest lungs to breathe.                                          [Exeunt the Shakspeare family, L.—Sir Thomas Lucy rises—the table, chair of justice, and Drawl's stool are removed by the two followers of Slyboots, R. Sir T. (C.) A saucy varlet, that: by the rotundity of
[Page 25]
our person, a most impertinent young coxcomb; but we will be more rigid with such night-birds in future. [In turning, he encounters Drawl, who stands beside him.] And now, good Master Drawl, drawl thyself hence— thou art an useful drudge enough, but much too tardy; though that is a defect which not thou, but Nature, who bungled thee in the making, must to the gods account for.
Drawl. (R.) I will strive to amend, most worshipful Sir Thomas. Yea, verily, I will essay to a-mend.
                                         [Drawling the latter word worse than before—exit, R. Sir T. [Imitating him.] A—men! cry I to thy amendment, the which, an thou accomplish it not speedily, though thou be'st a good pack-horse, I'm a grass-hopper but I'll send thee packing—Slyboots, come hither, knave!
Sly. [Advancing, R., bowing obsequiously.] Most worshipful [225]   Sir Thomas—
Sir T. (L.) Thou art an expert knave in thine office, therefore will we advance thee—thou shalt have Drawl's place, an thou be scholar sufficient—what say'st thou?
Sly. (R.) Thankfulness, most worshipful sir, hath made me tongue-tied; and in this moment to clothe my feelings in words were neither more nor less than on one and the same day to breakfast on earth, dine in the moon, and sup with Apollo in the centre of the sun. In a word, a thing clean impossible, your worship
Sir T. [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha! thou art a merry wag. I love wit as dearly as I love venison and sack. By the rotundity of our person, that was a quaint conceit of thine, Master Slyboots—to sup with Apollo in the centre o' the sun—that must needs be a hot supper, eh?— [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha! That's a good one, isn't it?—Why dost not laugh?
Sly. (R.) [Laughing vulgarly.] Ha, ha, ha!
Sir T. [Raising his cane.] That's enough—thou see'st thou art not the only wit in the world. [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha!
Sly. Of that I am duly sensible; my puny wit, compared to that of your worship, is but as a gnat compared to an elephant.
Sir T. Good again! excellent! Marry but we will [250]   drink a cup of sack together after dinner, for we perceive thou hast both learning and discretion, and thy advancement is sure—yet must we have proof positive
[Page 26]
of thy ability. [Crossing to R.] Go thou, therefore, and draw up, in good set terms, a proclamation against deer-stealing; the which we will have affixed to the gate of our park; ay, hung up as a rod to scare offenders—remember, Master Slyboots, a proclamation—hear'st thou? A thundering proclamation!
                                         [Exit, R. Sly. Marry, though I were to sit me down, and cogitate for a month, yet could I not do his worship's bidding; seeing, I can neither read nor write;—yet am I herein no ways inferior to his worship, who is himself so great an ignoramus, that he knoweth not a primer from a prayer-book, unless it be by the pictures: yet doth he justice it exceedingly well, by deputy; and wherefore may not I?—My plot is ripe!—Slyboots, thy fortune is made!—and now for my thundering proclamation!
                                         [Exit, L. SCENE IV. —Interior of John Shakspeare's House—the room in which our immortal bard was born—chairs and table, C., with pen, ink, and paper. Enter William Shakspeare and Gilbert, r. Gil. S. And wilt thou not come with me to the wool-market, brother Willy
Wil. S. (L.)
Go thou, good brother Gilbert; prove thyself
A thrifty merchant, and thou wilt be prized:—
If honour set her seal to all thy bargains,
Most highly, amongst honourable men:—
But, as for me, I was not born to trudge
In the low valleys of life's tedious journey;—
No! to the mountains doth my soul aspire!
Where, unobscured by clouds, the day-god pours
His radiant fire! 'Tis there my spirit soars! Gil. S. (R.) The eagle, on strong pinions, mounteth aloft, and getteth nought but fresh air for his breakfast; while the poor goose contenteth herself with waddling about the barn-door, or playeth her gambols in a dirty pond—certain she of barley for dinner, and fish for
[Page 27]
supper;—now, prithee, tell me, brother Willy, which is the better of the two: an air-fed eagle, or a barley-fed goose?
Wil. S. (L.) [Affectionately taking his brother's hand.] Scoff not at what thou canst not comprehend.
Gil. S. [Crossing to L.] Well, e'en as thou wilt, brother Willy: I must away to hear the music of the shears,—so fare thee well!
                                         [Going, L. Enter Slyboots, l. Gil. S. [25]   Ah! give ye good-day, Master Slyboots.
Sly. Save you, good Master Gilbert. [Exit Gilbert, L., exchanging compliments.] Save you, good Master Willy Shakspeare.
                                         [Bowing. Wil. S. Thou here, again? What wouldst thou with me now?
Sly. Crave a favour—a mighty favour, good Master Willy Shakspeare, at thy hands. His worship, Sir Thomas Lucy, weary of the tardiness of his clerk, Theophilus Drawl, hath most bountifully proffer'd me the office—provided I show proof competent of mine ability.
Wil. S. [Impatiently, R.] Prithee, be brief!—straight to the point, at once.
Sly. (L.) The proof demanded, is the draught of a proclamation against deer-stealing—a thundering proclamation! to be publicly exhibited at the gate of Charlcotte Park. Now, seeing that I am illiterate, I would intreat of you, good Master Willy Shakspeare— you being an expert penman, to draw up the said proclamation in my stead, in good set terms; and I will most gladly pay thee for thy pains, whatsoever thou mayst require.
Wil. S.
And wouldst thou dispossess thy fellow servant
Of place and profit, by an act of fraud?
[50]   Shame, shame! moreover, ignorant as thou art,
How canst perform the duties of thy charge? Sly. By deputy, an like ye, kind Master Willy—by deputy;—even as Sir Thomas himself dischargeth his duty; for he, though a knight of the shire, is as ignorant as your humble servant.
Wil. S. [Aside.]
Oh, Jupiter! and is it at the nod
Of such dull asses thou wouldst have us tremble?                                          [To Slyboots.
A thundering proclamation, saidst thou not?
[Page 28]
Sly.
So spake his worship. Wil. S.
It shall be done, anon:—prithee, be silent.                                          [Sits down, R., at the table, and writes rapidly. Sly. [Apart, delighted.] Master Willy Shakspeare is, unquestionably, the ablest penman in all Stratford;— he'll draw up the proclamation in good set terms, I warrant me; and then, [In Drawl's manner.] out goes stupid old Drawl, [In his natural voice.] and in comes clever Master Slyboots. Oh, it's a capital plot! a glorious plot!
Wil. S. [Rising and coming down, L.] Here, take thy proclamation.
                                         [Gives a large paper. Sly. (R.) Good, kind, sweet Master Willy Shakspeare! and thy reward?
                                         [Offering money. Wil. S. The pleasure of exposing knaves and fools; no more.
Sly. Thanks! innumerable thanks for thy generosity, [75]   good, sweet Master Willy. Now to his worship, with my thundering proclamation!
                                         [Exit, L. Wil. S. [Soliloquy.]
I'm weary of this dull and rustic life,
And for a time will quit my father's roof:
But whither wend my steps? I do remember,
Some few years since, a troop of merry players,
Who came to Stratford, jovial boon companions:
If I err not, the troop is now in London.
What, if I join them—sure, 'twere no offence,
For, moralizing—“all the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;—
They have their exits, and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts”—
Then, why not I? Oh, for a sphere of action!
Where the mind's vigour hath unbounded range!
Nature and Fate both point me out the way;
Shakspeare, it is thy duty to obey.                                          [Looking off, R.
Father, farewell! dear mother, do not grieve;
Farewell, ye dear companions of my youth!
William will ne'er forget your love and truth:
It grieves his soul to fill your souls with sorrow,
Yet evening storms oft bring a sunny morrow—
In heaven's name then, Shakspeare, on to London!                                          [Exit, L.
[Page 29]
SCENE V. —The Gates of Charlcotte Park. Enter a Crier, followed by a numerous train of Townsfolk and Peasantry of both sexes, L. U. E. Crier. [Ringing his bell.] Oyez, oyez, oyez! know, all men, women, and children, that his worship, Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcotte, intendeth to exhibit, as a wholesome warning, a most thundering proclamation against the stealing of deer! and dear will he have to pay for it, who shall in future be found guilty of the offence! God save the Queen!
Omnes. Hurrah!
Enter Gilbert Shakspeare, r. , cracking nuts—as soon as he appears, the girls all run, teazing him. Gil. S. Now, I pray ye, girls, do let a bashful young man alone—I seek not your familiarity—an ye show not more modesty of deportment, you'll constrain me to lodge a complaint against ye, before his worship, Sir Thomas; so, you had best keep your distance, for see, here he comes.
Enter Sir Thomas Lucy , followed by Drawl , centre gates —all present unbonnet and bow to his worship, as he passes. Sir T. We have thought fit to summon ye hither, by sound of bell, that you may hear our will and pleasure. Know, then, we have reason to be exceeding wrath! our anger burns within us, like a fiery oven! and we are determined instantly to hang up— [The Peasantry, alarmed, feel their necks.] a proclamation; [They all cry, “Oh!”] to deter all such idle knaves and sluts, as may, in future, happen to long for a haunch of venison for their dinner: and here comes Master Slyboots, with our decree.
Enter Slyboots , with his paper, L. Sly. (L.) Here it is, your worship! such a thundering [25]   composition! every word of it mine own, too—there, your worship, only read it. [Aside.] I know he can't; but that matters not. [To Sir Thomas.] Read it, Sir Thomas, and confess that Vulcan never forged such thunder in his life,—no, never! The bolts of Jove were but parched peas, in comparison.

[Page 30]
Sir T. [Pretending to read the proclamation.] Exquisite! capital! sublime! better and better!] Slyboots is highly pleased.] The proclamation pleaseth us exceedingly: and now, good, clever Master Slyboots, prithee read it aloud, for the edification of the multitude.
                                         [Gives the paper to Slyboots. Sly. [Suddenly perplexed—aside.] How the plague shall I excuse mine own ignorance? [To Sir Thomas Lucy, returning the paper] Impossible, Sir Thomas—I know my duty better:—pray, read it yourself; the proclamation would come with tenfold weight from the eloquent mouth of your most worshipful worship.
Sir T. [Taking the paper—aside.] The people dare not know we cannot read the vulgar English tongue. [To Slyboots.] True, most true, Master Slyboots, thou art right; but we do not happen to have our eye-glasses about us, just now, and therefore—
Drawl. (R. C.) [Taking off his large spectacles.] Mine are very much at your worship's service.
Sir T. (L. C.) Psha! thine, indeed! away with such [50]   rubbish! they are mounted in copper!—think'st thou, Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcotte, would disgrace his right honourable nose, by wearing glasses mounted in copper? Go to! thou hast a dull brain, Master Drawl— a most dull brain!—We therefore do repeat our command, —Slyboots, read thou the proclamation.
Sly. [In despair, pretending that the gnats have flown into his eyes.] Oh, oh!
Sir T. Why, what's the matter, now!
Sly. (L.) [Dancing about, as in much pain.] Oh! curse the gnats! they have clean blinded me, your worship.
Sir T. Mirabile dicta! what, both eyes at once?
Sly. (L.) Both, as I'm a sinner. Oh!
Sir T. (L. C.) Then must Drawl perform the task. Come hither, Master Longface, and read aloud the proclamation, with due emphasis and discretion.
Drawl. (R. C.) [Takes the paper, puts on his glasses, and starts, amazed.] And am I to read the contents of this paper, most worshipful Sir Thomas?
Sir T. Most assuredly, thou art. Is it not an excellent proclamation, written in good set terms?
Sly. (L.) Ay, marry! a capital proclamation.
Drawl. Oh, Jupiter! I dare not read it; an I do, your worship will have me whip-ped, ca-ged—nay, even
[Page 31]
suspended, not only in mine office, but by the neck until I die.
Sir T. [75]   Dolt! idiot! read the proclamation, we command thee!
Drawl. An I must, I must. [Turning to the Peasantry.] but you are all witnesses, it is no fault of mine.
Omnes. Certainly not.
Drawl. [Reads aloud.] “Copy of verses on Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcotte.”
                                         [Sir Thomas stares, and Slyboots is confounded. Gil. S. (R.) [Looking over Drawl's shoulder.] 'Tis even so; Drawl readeth it correctly.
Drawl. (R. C.) [Reading.] “Verses on Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlcotte.
                                         [Slyboots trebles, L.
“A Parliament member; a justice of peace;
At home a poor scarecrow; in London an ass.”— Omnes. [Laughing.]
Ha, ha, ha!                                          [Slyboots scampers off, L. Sir T. [In a violent passion, L. C.] Hold! seize that scoundrel, Slyboots! [He is dragged in again, by two Bailiffs.] Into the stocks with him!
Sly. Hear me, your worship; hear me!
Sir T. Not a word: into the stocks with him, I say! and let two of our bailiffs stand over the godless knave, and knock his brains out if he offer to speak a word. [Two Peasants bring forward the stocks and seat to R. S. E. —the Bailiffs put Slyboots into the stocks, and, as he attempts to speak in his defence, silence him by raising their cudgels—the mob cross over to L.—Sir Thomas affecting calmness.] And now, with all the dignity of true philosophy, will we patiently listen to the whole of this most slanderous libel; in order that we may have sufficient [100]   proof to hang up the author thereof, that scoundrel, Slyboots, without either judge or jury.
Sly. Oh! your worship!
                                         [The Bailiffs silence him. Sir T. [Suppressing his anger.] Proceed, good Master Drawl, proceed.
Drawl. [Reads.]
“At home a poor scarecrow; in London, an ass—
A haughty, proud, insolent knight of the shire,
Whom nobody loves; though there's many him fear.
To the sessions he went, and did sorely complain,
His park had been robb'd, and his deer had been slain.
If a juvenile frolic he cannot forgive,
We'll sing stupid Lucy as long as we live.”
[Page 32]
                                         [The Peasantry burst out into a loud laugh, when his worship strikes at them with his cane, and snatching the paper from his clerk, tramples on it. Sir T. [In a violent rage.] Go, fetch a rope! and let it be a long one! [Slyboots attempts to speak.] Not a word, thou monster of ingratitude! not a syllable, till thou art hanged on yonder tree. [A Bailiff brings a rope on, L.] Now, up with him!
Sly. Oh!
                                         [He is silenced by the Bailiffs. Drawl. Justice commandeth me to lift up my voice in behalf of poor Solomon Slyboots—he is not guilty of this libel, for, to my certain knowledge, he can neither read nor write.
                                         [Bailiffs begin to release him. Sir T. Not guilty! and if Slyboots be innocent of the libel, who is the author of it?
Drawl. I know the hand-writing full well—it is that [125]   of Master Willy Shakspeare.
Sly. [Falling at Sir Thomas Lucy's feet, C.] Yes, your worship, it is most truly William Shakspeare's—
Sir T. That daring poacher! go, run! fly! some twenty of you, and bring him hither, tied neck and heels. We'll have the young scoundrel whipped, caged, thumb-screwed, hanged, drawn, and quartered. Fly, I say, and bring the scoundrel hither
                                         [Peasantry cross over to R.—the Bailiffs are running off, L. Gil. S. Stay where you are—it's no use, for brother Willy, so please your worship, is just gone off to London.
Omnes. [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha! Hurrah!
Sir T. [In a rage.] What, ho! saddle me my dappled stallion—I'll follow the saucy scoundrel to the world's end, but I'll have satisfaction. To horse! to horse, I say! Revenge! revenge!
                                         [Amidst the rage of Sir Thomas, the laughter of the Peasantry, the ringing of the Crier's bell, and the amazement of poor Drawl, the scene closes.

END OF ACT I.

[Page 33]
ACT II. SCENE I —London—the Exterior of the Falcon Tavern, the favourite resort of the Globe Company of Comedians, in Shakspeare's time. Enter Richard Burbage and Tarleton , 5 from the tavern, L. D. F., the latter somewhat inebriated, with a cup of sack in his hand. Bur. (R.) Prithee, now, Tarleton, come with me, while thou canst walk erect, for, ere long, an' thou goest on thus, thou'lt crawl on all fours like a beast.
Tar. (L.) An' I do, Burbage, I'll be a merry brute, that's certain; for never did I feel more jovially inclined—
                                         [Sings.
Though poor as Job, I nothing lack,
While thus I quaff my cup of sack.                                          [Drinks. Bur. Yet, bethink thee, Tarleton, it is now very near the play hour; and have we not to enact before the Lord Southampton, and divers other personages of high degree? —Therefore, I pray thee, good Tarleton, be moderate in thy potations.
Tar. So I am, Burby; perfectly moderate, and wise, too, for a fool: the which both nature and practice, will I, nill I, did conspire to make of me: an thou look for wise actions from fools, thou art no better than a fool for thy pains.
Bur. Come, prithee, now, be rational for once. Thou know'st the multitude do highly prize thee for thy extravagance in season, which prompteth thee to be no less extravagant out of season: yet recollect wit, like strong diet, is not for every day.
Tar. True; nor dull homilies but for time of Lent. Preach thou, therefore, good Burby, an thou wilt; for [25]   my part, I'll drink sack till I am clean sacked of every penny; so one more cup in honour of Queen Elizabeth, and then straight away to the Globe—what ho, hostess!
Enter Hostess , from the tavern, L. D. F. Hos. Always at hand, gentlemen; always at hand.
Tar. Good mine hostess, one cup more. [She takes the cup, but Burbage winks to her to bring no more.] I
[Page 34]
love Queen Elizabeth, for she loves us players, heaven bless her.
                                         [Exit Hostess, L. D. F. Bur. But suppose we toast the Queen after the play— what sayst thou, Tarleton, after the play?
Tar. Agreed.
Bur. But, talking of the Queen, thou hast doubtless heard of the prize her majesty intends giving—her own picture set in diamonds, for the best poem on a matter commanded by herself.
Tar. Marry, not I; for, not being a poet, it concerneth me not: yet what doth the subject touch upon?
Bur. The merits of our art—the royal theme proposed is, which deserves the palm, tragedy or comedy?
Tar. Comedy, say I.
Bur. And tragedy, say I—thus we differ—I look for great contention; a very joust and tournament amongst the wits of the court, on this matter, rely upon it: so honourable is the prize, that many a pen—not lance, indeed, will be shivered in the contest.
Tar. [50]   Ay, marry, and many a knight errant, no doubt, be most unceremoniously unhorsed from his Pegasus. But say, who are the candidates?
Bur. Why, in the first place, there's the mighty Doctor Orthodox, the Master of the Revels—
Tar. Quantum suff.—an he enter the lists, none other hath even a shadow of good fortune on his side, for Doctor Orthodox is a very Colossus of learning,—his brain must be a perfect Bibliotheca.
Bur. And yet I know of one, who, though a youth, would prove a David to this huge Goliah, were he but here.
Tar.
His name, Burby, his name? Bur.
Is William Shakspeare, of the town of Stratford, 6
A youth of parts so rare, that, summ'd together,
They make up such a total as the world
Ne'er boasted of, till he beheld the light.
Trust me, I measure not his noble qualities
With friendship's fond and magnifying eye—
Yet stake my life, were time and place befitting,
Shakspeare would bear away the royal prize,
And stand confess'd The Wonder of the World ! Tar. Send for him, Burby; prithee, send for him: an it were but fairly to unhorse old Doctor Orthodox—I
[Page 35]
hate him; for though I twist my mouth into the drollest [75]   of all possible contortions, his sapience never once vouchsafeth to laugh at me;—therefore I pray thee, send for Willy Shakspeare; now do, good Burby, do.
Bur. I will, I will, Tarleton, on the instant; but now to the Globe, [Crosses to L., and looks off.] for see! the company are flocking to the play—thou must lend me a sword, Tarleton, for mine is at the cutler's—I know thou'lt not say nay.
Tar. Not for the Queen's crown to thee, Burby; I never say nay to a friend, for then were I no Christian man, but a horse—so come along, thou shalt have my best sword, my well-tempered toledo. Come!
                                         [Exeunt, L. Enter William Shakspeare , dejectedly, R. Wil. S.
Here am I, then, in London; all alone,
In this vast world, so full of company,
Where each man stares his fellow i' the face,
Then passes on, without “God save thee, friend”—
Why did I leave my father's friendly roof,
To wander thus an exile through the world,
Expos'd to suffer what's far worse than death—
Neglect, contempt! [Heroically.] The brave man need not suffer!
“For who would bear the whips and scorn o' the time,
“The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely:
“The insolence of office, and the spurns
“That patient merit of th' unworthy takes—
“When he with ease might his quietus make
[100]   “With a bare bodkin?”                                          [Regarding the tavern.
Mayhap the host of yonder tavern knows
Where my good townsman, Burbage, dwells in London—
I'll knock and see, if to a guest so poor,
They deem it worth their while to ope' the door.                                          [Knocks. Enter Hostess, l. d. f. Hos. (L.)
Well, youngster, what now? Wil. S. (R.)
Give ye good morrow, dame. Hos. (L.) Thank ye, young man; what is thy pleasure? —A whole flask, or only a cup of sack?
Wil. S. [Sighing.]
Neither, good dame, for empty is my purse:
I merely would inquire— Hos. [Sharply.] No sack! neither a flask, nor even a cup! Why, thou saucy varlet! think'st thou an honest
[Page 36]
woman hath no better occupation, than to open her door, walk forth, and stand question to every idle loon that chooseth to knock?
Wil. S. Nay, good dame—I prithee be not wrath—
Hos. 'Twere enough to make one, methinks. This, sirrah, is the Falcon Tavern; I am the hostess thereof; and whoever knocks here must have good cross and coin in his pocket—ay, marry, must he, good silver or gold.
                                         [Exit into the tavern, L. D. F. Wil. S. [Soliloquy.]
Oh, for the rustic's hospitality!
Who, though his meal be but a scanty pittance,
Most gladly shares it with the passing stranger:
[125]   Begs him to rest his weary limbs awhile,
Then to his guest points out the doubtful way,
And, parting, cries, “God speed thee on thy journey!”
But here, with Midas, all would feed on gold.
Gold! gold! the rich man's boast, the poor man's hope,
The miser's god and devil, both in one.
Oh, Shakspeare! here in London thou art lost;
Merit thou canst not have, for thou lack'st gold.                                          [Exit, L. Enter Sir Thomas Lucy, r. , followed by Drawl , both in travelling attire. Sir T. (L.) Here we are, then, in London, good Master Drawl; and, by the rotundity of our person, we swear we'll have revenge! As knight of the shire, we can readily gain audience of the Queen; and if that vile young scapegrace, Willy Shakspeare, be in London, the law shall reach him. Thou hast the libel in safe keeping, good Master Drawl?
Drawl. (R.) [Pulling it slowly out of his pocket.] It is here, most worshipful Sir Thomas.
Sir T. Right, Master Drawl; and thou art my witness. Ah! I pant for revenge! An the young villain had the nine lives of a cat, by St. George, and the dragon to boot, he should lose every one of them! To kill one of my fattest bucks! question my wisdom! and call me—
Drawl. An ass! [Pointing to the paper] that was the very word, an't please you, right worshipful Sir Thomas.
Sir T. [Angrily.] [150]   Psha! it pleaseth me not; and thou art an ass for thy pains. How dar'st thou repeat the beastly phrase in our hearing?
Drawl. I thought your worship was at fault, and wished me to expound, most sapient Sir Thomas.

[Page 37]
Sir T. Expound, forsooth! an I were in Stratford, I'd have thee pounded for thine expounding. But now to the royal palace, to demand justice—ay, justice and revenge! Master Drawl, draw thyself after me—dost hear?—Follow thou the steps of wisdom.
Drawl. [Slowly following him.] I will, most sapient Sir Thomas.
                                         [Exeunt, L. SCENE II. —Exterior of the Globe Theatre, Bankside, with distant view of old St. Paul's, &c.—The Globe is an hexagonal wooden building, covered with reeds—a long pole, with a flag, is erected, to notify, as was the custom, that the entertainments are going on—over the principal entrance is a sign, on which is represented the figure of Atlas supporting the globe—underneath is written, “Totus mundus agit histrionem”—“All the world acts a play.” Enter William Shakspeare, r. Wil. S. [Soliloquy.]
There stands the Globe, the house of entertainment:
And yet, methinks, the players of the day
Seek more to gratify the vulgar crew
With idle foolery, than to mend the heart,
By acting Nature's self in colours true!                                          [Loud cries heard without, R. S. E.
What cry was that? See, on the river's brink
There rides a noble knight—his foaming steed,
Refusing to be curbed by bit or rein,
Now plunges wildly: some adventurous arm
Must seize the bridle, else the rider's lost!                                          [Rushes off, R. S. E.—After a momentary pause, loud shouts of acclamation are heard without. Enter Lord Southampton , as if slightly hurt, leaning on William Shakspeare's shoulder—two Pages following, R. S. E.—One Page immediately goes into the theatre, but soon rejoins his companion at the back. Lord S. [To Shakspeare.]
Young man, thou surely art my guardian angel!
Hadst thou not seiz'd my horse, 7 I must have fallen
Into the angry flood. Pr'ithee, thy name— Wil. S. (R.)
Is William Shakspeare, my good sir.
[Page 38]
Lord S. (L.)
Know, thou hast saved the life of Lord Southampton. Wil. S.
I joy to hear it: yet believe me, sir,
Humanity, whose humble child I am,
Did not allow me leisure to inquire
Whether the sufferer I would snatch from death
Was a poor peasant or a noble lord! Lord S.
I like thy answer well; and, for thy pains,
Accept my purse and friendship.                                          [Offering a purse. Wil. S. [Modestly declining the money.]
The latter were by far the richer boon. Enter Burbage and Tarleton , from the Theatre, L. S. E. Bur.
I trust no harm hath reached your noble lordship. Lord S.
[25]   None! thanks to this young man, my brave deliverer.                                          [Pointing to Shakspeare. Bur.
Why! may I trust my eyes? 'tis William Shakspeare!                                          [Crosses to Shakspeare.
Welcome, my boy, to London.                                          [Shakes hands with him. Wil. S.
Thanks, honest Burbage! Tar.
Shakspeare here! Bravo! Now, old Doctor
Orthodox, mayst thou shake in thy shoes. Bur. [Introducing Shakspeare to Lord Southampton.]
My lord, permit me to present to you
A young adventurous poet, who shall pluck
The laurel-wreath from pedantry and pride—
Making them sink to nothing in the dust
Of abjectness before him! Lord S.
What, a poet!
Then shall he under our protection stand,
As candidate to-morrow for the prize
Our gracious Queen, in presence of her court,
Means to bestow upon victorious merit.                                          [To Shakspeare.
Take thou this ring—accept it as a token
Of our future friendship and regard.                                          [Shakspeare crosses to Lord Southampton.
What nobler exercise for wealth than this—
To raise the flower that hides its humble head,
And place it i' the sun? to foster Genius,
And from the caverns of the deep bring forth
The pearl, that gives the diadem its worth? 8
[Page 39]
Wil. S.
My lord, your kindness is a spur to action;
And should success my humble efforts crown,
[50]   “The harvest,” noble sir, “is all your own.” Lord S.
When merit is with modesty combin'd,
The happy union speaks a noble mind.                                          [Exit into the Theatre, attended to the door, L. S. E., by Burbage, Tarleton, and Shakspeare, who then return. Bur. (R.)
[To Shakspeare.] Now, William, my boy, to work, to work!
For there's a grievous lack of entertainment:
It seems as though the playwrights of the day
Had neither fire, nor fancy, nor ambition.
From the French kitchen to cook up a dish
Of anything, no matter how averse
To English taste, is all their emulation;
But William Shakspeare shall convince the world,
Toys please not us, though they be gilded o'er—
For Nature is the goddess we adore! Wil. S. [Producing a manuscript.]
Here is a tragedy.                                          [Gives Burbage a MS. Bur. [Delighted.]
A tragedy! Tar. [To Shakspeare.] Pr'ithee, say, is there a good clown's 9 part in it for me?
Bur. [Looking over the MS.]
Hamlet! Methinks I've somewhere read the story.
It shall be played; but first you must procure
A warrant from old Doctor Orthodox.
Hath he a copy of the tragedy? Wil. S. (C.)
He hath. Tar. (L.) Seek thou the warrant when thou wilt, thou canst not fail to find him at home, mounted on his Pegasus.
Bur. (R.)
[Holding up Shakspeare's MS.] There though he ride for ever and a day,
[75]   In his whole life he'll not write such a play. Tar. (L.) Bravo, Willy Shakspeare! You are the boy who will soon bear away the palm of victory, in spite of all the Doctor Orthodoxes in the nation. But hark ye, Willy Shakspeare: whatever you write, be careful of one thing—don't forget me, d'ye hear, Willy?
Wil. S. (C.)
Not for the world, my friend; but let us hence.
[Page 40]

“The winter of my discontent” is past,
And fortune's sunshine smiles on me at last.                                          [Exeunt, arm-in-arm, into the Theatre, L. S. E. SCENE III. —An antique Apartment in the House of Doctor Orthodox—a bookcase, R. Enter Doctor Orthodox , with a long scroll of parchment, followed by his man Peter , very thin, R. Doc. (L.) Finis coronat opus! the poem is perfected which shall fill the world with wonder and amazement. From the days of Aristotle even down to the present moment, have I here given copious quotations from every tragedy and comedy which fourteen centuries have produced; then, with a masterly hand, have I from such ample premises drawn mine own incontrovertible conclusions, finally deciding in favour of tragedy. The royal prize is mine: already do I behold her majesty's picture, emblazoned with diamonds, hanging around my neck.
Peter. (R.) Where, an't please your sapience? where?
Doc. In fancy, dolt! marry, in imagination! Hadst thou a soul, things invisible to sense would yet be apparent to thy mental eye: but thou hast no sublimity in thee—gluttony is all thy thought; and venter non habet aures!
Peter. In mine eyes, and to my yearning stomach, the sublimest object in nature is a good dinner.
                                         [Knocking heard without, L. Doc. Some one knocks: therefore, shut thy mouth and open the door.
Peter.
Yes, master.                                          [Opens the door, L. Enter William Shakspeare , L. D. Wil. S.
I come, most sapient sir, to crave your warrant
For my new tragedy: 'tis for the Globe. Doc. [Eyeing Shakspeare suspiciously.]
[25]   Thou write a tragedy! Who art thou, youngster?
Say, of what college art thou a graduate? Wil. S.
I cannot boast of learning: all I know
Was taught me by a worthy schoolmistress. Doc. A schoolmistress! Some old village grandam, no doubt.
Wil. S [With dignity.]
Not so:
[Page 41]

Creation's boundless temple was my school—
Mankind my study! 'Tis a royal college,
Endowed most nobly by the King of kings!
There Nature in one hour teaches more
Than in an age your Greek and Latin lore! Doc. Profane idea! An thou art not erudite, young man, how canst thou ever hope to be a poet?
Wil. S.
Be my work good or ill, I crave your warrant,
And wait upon your leisure. Doc. [Contemptuously.]
Where is this tragedy of yours? Wil. S.
You have it, sir—'tis entitled Hamlet. Peter. (R.)
'Tis here, most sapient sir.                                          [Opening a book-case and handing the Doctor a MS. Doc. I recollect—hem! Hamlet: 10 [Looking over the MS. and a precious Hamlet it is, too—here we have a ghost—a youth who seigns madness, and a young maiden truly out of her wits—then come a couple of grave-diggers,—now, really young man, prithee tell me, art thou not often, at the full of the moon, somewhat [50]   deranged? Out of pure friendship do I counsel thee to return home, with all convenient speed; and drive a cart, hew wood, carry water, or follow the plough—but attempt not to write tragedies, for, without Greek and Latin, how canst thou possibly hope to thrive?
Wil. S. (L.) I pray you, sir, judge not too hastily.
Doc. Moreover, here is one Laertes, whom you, in your first act, send from Denmark to Paris, already returned again in the fourth—marry, now, but thou must be a most unconscionable play-wright! Prithee, tell me, doth thy father keep post-horses with wings, that thou requirest thy spectators to travel with this same Master Laertes no less than six hundred leagues in somewhat less than two hundred minutes? Hast thou never heard of Aristotle and his three grand unities of action, time, and place?
Wil. S. Never, most sapient sir.
Doc. So it appeareth, most assuredly. Go, youngster, and follow the plough: six hundred leagues in two hundred minutes! oh! monstrous violation of all rule! oh, immortal Aristotle! what wouldst thou say to this?

[Page 42]
Wil. S. [With dignity.]
Let Aristotle say what he thinks fit—
Shakspeare replies:—What is so quick as thought?
“Not e'en the lightning, which doth cease to be,
Ere we can say it lightens!”
[75]   The glowing fancy soars aloft to heaven,
And, in the twinkling of an eye, descends
From thence, into the fathomles abyss
Of earth's deep centre, or the ocean's bed!
From east to west, from pole to pole, she flies,
Far swifter than Apollo's golden rays
Can give the hills their early morning kiss!
Dull souls may fail in the gigantic race,
But nobler spirits know nor time nor space! Doc. Prithee, tell me, from whom didst thou learn that speech, young man?
Wil. S. From good Dame Nature, sir; my schoolmistress.
Doc. [With a sarcastic smile.] 'Tis evident thou art not compos mentis, youngster; and therefore—
Wil. S. [Impatiently.] The warrant, sapient sir—I crave your warrant.
Doc. My duty compelleth me to refuse it; seeing this, thy tragedy of Hamlet is replete with absurdity, ignorance, and profanity!
Wil. S. [Confounded, yet speedily recollecting himself.] Know you this ring, sir?
Doc. [Regarding it.] It is the signet-ring of my Lord Southampton.
Wil. S. His lordship is my patron
Doc Indeed! [Bows most obsequiously.] Oh! that's quite another case—young gentleman, you shall have [100]   our warrant, instantly. Peter! a pen here— [Peter brings one, and a portfolio, from bookcase—the doctor signs the warrant.] 'tis done. [Hands it to Shakspeare.] Here, young gentleman, is our warrant, and most heartily do we wish you every success. Our own superior discernment leads us to discover, that you have talent—much talent; and, under the high auspices of my Lord Southampton, you may, provided you study Aristotle, one day become as great a poet as the renowned Dr. Orthodox, who stands before you
Wil. S. [Pointedly.]
He who is great in his own estimation,
Is like a man standing upon a mountain—
[Page 43]

All men seem little to him, from above;
And he, heaven knows, looks little from below.                                          [Exit, L. Doc.
Peter, follow me.                                          [Exit, with a pompous air, followed by Peter in humble distance, R. SCENE IV. The Palace of Queen Elizabeth—Grand Council-Chamber. Her Majesty discovered seated on the throne, surrounded by Lord Southampton , the Earl of Leicester , and other Nobles, Guards, and Attendants—grand flourish. Queen E.
To the assembled nobles of our court,
Do we in this eventful moment look,
For faithful counsel. The inveterate foes
Of England's peace are now in arms against us—
War, roused from slumber, shakes his gory locks,
Glares fearfully around him, and in haste
Girds on his sword; and, with a horrid smile
Of joy malevolent, anticipates
The ruthless slaughter's sanguinary bliss!
Philip of Spain, urged by the fiery zeal
Which stamps him bigot, insolently dares
To dictate to your queen! shall this be borne? Earl L.
Never! Queen E. (C.)
Since fate decrees, the world in us shall see
A second Joan of Arc. At heaven's command,
We, for the sceptre, laid the distaff by;
Yet shall they feel Queen Bess can wield a sword,
And die or conquer for her native land! Earl L.
Our gracious Queen may answer taunt with taunt,
For with our lives will we support her cause;
If all agree with me, your voices raise,
And with loud acclamations bid defiance
To Philip and his slaves! long live the Queen! Lord S.
Long live the Queen Queen E.
[25]   Surrounded as we are by noble hearts
That pant for liberty—by warriors bold,
Ready to shed their blood in our defence,
And conscious that kind heaven is smiling o'er us,
We can have nought to fear. Earl L.
'Tis not unlikely but our hearts of oak
May gain the laurels!
[Page 44]

And, ah! may England never see the day,
When cold neglect shall from his native shore
Banish to distant climes the honest tar;
For then her glory sets, to rise no more! Queen E.
The wooden walls of England are our pride;
And we to them have left the chief defence
Of our beloved island; yet it joys
Each heart, to see such goodly preparation
To meet the Spaniard, should he dare to land. Lord S. (C.)
Ay: now the slumb'ring god
Of peace doth yield to busy, bustling war,
My native element; for in a camp
I first beheld heaven's light! Oh, how I love
To hear the clang of arms! the charger's neigh!
The trump's shrill clarion! the enlivening shout!
To see the array of battle rolling on,
Till spear meets spear, and blade encounters blade!
When for our sacred fatherland 11 we fight,
[50]   And England's Queen, the victory is won! Enter Officer, l. Offi. [Kneeling to the Queen.]
Long live the Queen! and may her enemies
Be ever thus confounded. Queen E.
Your news? your news? Offi.
The grand armada doth exist no more:
After a hard-fought battle, England gained
A glorious victory! Queen E. [Rising.]
To heaven above be praise!                                          [Comes forward, attended by Lord Southampton and the Earl of Leicester, two Pages holding her train, while others place a smaller throne or chair of state with a footstool farther forward than the grand throne. Queen E.
Now, to the discord of harsh, clanging war
Let harmony, heavenly harmony, succeed;
And innocence, join'd hand in hand with sport,
Grace with their festive smiles our happy court
Alike desirous to promote the good
Of arts and arms, we publicly award
This day the prize to poetry: the theme
Of our choice is, which deserves the palm
Of merit—tragedy or comedy?                                          [Crosses, L.
[Page 45]
Enter Tarleton with his wand of office, R. Queen E.
Good merry Tarleton, whom we have appointed
Chief usher of the motley festive scene, stand forth!
And Richard Burbage, too.                                          [The Queen sits, C. Enter Richard Burbage, r. Queen E. [To Tarleton.]
And now, without delay, good master usher,
Admit the candidates. Tar.
Most mighty Doctor Orthodox, stand forth! Enter Doctor Orthodox , with a long scroll of parchment, R. Tar.
The second candidate is William Shakspeare. Enter William Shakspeare , with a MS. rolled up, R. —he bows respectfully. Tar. These two, an't please your majesty, are all; [75]   for not one, save this young Hercules, [To Shakspeare.] had mettle enough to enter the lists against the mighty Doctor Orthodox.
                                         [Dr. Orthodox regards Shakspeare with a look of sovereign contempt. Queen E. [To William Shakspeare.] Young man, who art thou?
Wil. S.
An humble minstrel, whose untutored lays
Do dare contend with wisdom for the prize;
For, where the gracious Queen of England sits as judge,
A first attempt with royal smiles to cheer,
The poorest candidate hath nought to fear.                                          [Crosses to C., kneels and hands his MS. to the Queen. Lord S. [To the Queen.]
Beneath the sunshine of your highness' favour,
This rural flower cannot fail to thrive. Queen E. [Looking over the MS. with evident delight.]
He shall not lack a fostering hand to rear him,                                          [Regarding Shakspeare.
For in his eye there glows intelligence;
Which heaven alone, and not scholastic lore,
Could have inspired.                                          [Shakspeare rises, and crosses behind to R. Doc. [Pompously.] I, Doctor Orthodox, do now stand forth, and defy the whole world to produce aught equal to this, my epic poem, touching the merits of tragedy and comedy—which epic poem—
                                         [Presenting it to the Queen.
[Page 46]
Queen E. [With a smile, turning from it.] Is much too long, e'en for a lawyer's bill.
                                         [Tarleton signifies to the Doctor he may draw back, striking Orthodox's parchment scroll contemptuously with his wand. Tar. [Bowing to the Queen.] So please your gracious majesty, think you the pillars which support this royal chamber of audience, are sufficiently strong to bear a [100]   very considerable portion of additional weight?
Queen E. Wherefore this question, thou most merry wag?
Tar. Marry, because Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlcotte, is now without, and craves an audience of your majesty and you will allow he is a man of weight.
Queen E.
Admit him.                                          [Exit Officer, L. Enter Sir Thomas Lucy, l. Queen E.
Welcome, Sir Thomas Lucy.                                          [He is about to kneel.
Nay, now, prithee, kneel not,
For when the mighty fall—to rise again
They find no easy task. What is your suit? Sir T. Justice, most gracious queen! justice to one of the greatest men in your majesty's dominions. [Seeing Shakspeare, he starts amazed.] Why, how is this?—Am I dreaming?—That poacher here at court!—Ay, marry, the selfsame young scoundrel, Willy Shakspeare, the villain who—
Queen E.
Silence, sir!—Oh, oh!                                          [Pronounced in the Queen's peculiar manner.
Such language may suit Stratford well,
But not our presence. We've heard the whole affair
From Lord Southampton. 'Twas a youthful frolic,
And no offence of such vast magnitude—
You must forgive him. Sir T.
I never can, your majesty. Queen E. [Rising imperiously]
But we command you. 'Sdeath! shall we chastise
[125]   For a mere venal fault, where heaven, approving,
Hath showered down choicest gifts. With our good sword,
Twenty Sir Thomas Lucy's could we make
In half an hour, but not one William Shakspeare.
Give him your hand, Sir Thomas—give him your hand, sir. Sir T. I obey, my liege, I obey. [Wheels round most
[Page 47]
ludicrously to where Shakspeare is standing, without turning his face from the Queen, to whom he keeps bowing all the while.] Thy hand, Master Willy Shakspeare. [With as much reluctance as he dares evince, or rather, as Mr. Bartley so excellently acted this part, with hatred in one eye, and friendship in the other.] Thou art a merry wag, a right merry wag, Master Willy. That humorous prank of thine, the killing one of our fattest bucks, and drawing up that thundering proclamation, shall be buried in oblivion; for at the time those follies were committed—
Wil. S. I was both poor and friendless, and am now Exalted to great honours.
Sir T. The which do justify the killing of bucks, and numerous other irregularities.
Wil. S.
Most truly spoken—'tis the way o' the world—
That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier were foul blasphemy. Queen E.
Ere we decide, we'll have another proof;
Putting the wits of all now present here,
To a sharp test.
Each shall express the wish he most desires,
In a short verse extempore: we will name
The order of the speakers; and the time
[150]   Our merry Tarleton takes in counting three
Is all we do allow for meditation.
Now to begin—Tarleton, what is thy wish? Tar. [Without the least reflection.]
Money! that I ne'er may lack,
   When I'm dry, a cup of sack. Queen E.
Now, Richard Burbage, your's. Tar. [Deliberately.]
One, two, three! Bur. Health to our queen, obedience to her laws; And what I prize most dearly—her applause.
Queen E. Now, Doctor Orthodox, express your wish.
Tar. [Having a spite against the Doctor, counts as rapidly as possible.] One, two, three!
Doc. [Confused.] All that is—all—all that is rare—all All that is rare of Greek and Latin books— Confound his one, two, three.
                                         [He cannot proceed. Sir T. An thou art puzzled for a rhyme, doctor—I'll help thee—

A sumptuous dinner dress'd by clever cooks. Queen E. Now, William Shakspeare, what's thy heart's desire?

[Page 48]
Tar. [Deliberately as before.]
One, two, three. Wil. S. [To the Queen.]
When born, thou wept'st while all around were smiling, 12
To see pure joy thy mother's woes beguiling:
Heaven grant, that when in death thou sink'st to sleep,
Thou mayst serenely smile, though all around thee weep. Queen E. [Rises.]
That was the crown of all; a heavenly wish,
[175]   And worthy of the tongue that gave it utterance.
Now let the trumpet tell the listening world,
That we to England's noblest bard decree
Our royal picture as his just reward.                                          [The picture, with a gold chain, is handed to the Queen by one of the ladies of honour, L. Queen E.
Shakspeare, approach! [The Bard kneels to the Queen, R., who hangs the picture around his neck. GRAND CHORUS —FINALE.
Loudly to th' immortal praise
Of our bard, from Avon's stream,
Do we tune our cheerful lays;
Do we sing this grateful theme.
Shakspeare! Shakspeare! none beside!
Shakspeare is his nation's pride! [The curtain falls.

The above beautiful idea is not my own—I read it once, somewhere in a foreign poet, but cannot call to mind where: all the merit I can claim is, having given it a tolerably decent English dress.
N. B.—The very judicious and elegant improvement in the above lines, of substituting the second personal pronoun for the first, is Mr. Charles Kemble's, and is a great proof of his judgment and good taste.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. —Walter's Cottage, surrounded by a neat Shrubbery, L.; a table and seats at the door, with fruits and other refreshments prepared for the wedding guests. —View of Lord Raymond's Castle, and surrounding Country, in the background—Little Robinette discovered arranging the collation at the table. Enter Walter from the cottage, L. Wal. (L.) Come, bustle, bustle, my dear. Our guests will shortly be here to the wedding. [Regarding the table.] That's right, you young rogue; I declare you're a very handy little servant, and so you had need be; for you mustn't expect any assistance from your sister Jane. Girls, on their wedding-day, have too much else to think of, to attend to company.
Rob. (R.) Oh, father, I'd give the world if I were but big enough to be married—I'm so fond of fine clothes and sweetmeats.
                                         [Retires up to the table. Wal. Psha! you little simpleton. When the time comes, you'll find that there are bitters as well as sweets in matrimony; though, for my part, I had no reason to complain; for my poor wife, Margery, who is now gone to her long home—Heaven's peace be with her! was one of the best creatures that ever lived. Well, well, she's better off now, that's one comfort. But what's this? [Wipes a tear from his eye.] I'll not grieve—no, I'm determined I'll not be sorrowful on my dear daughter's wedding-day. [To Robinette.] But say, my little darling, where is Henry?
Rob. [Coming forward, R.] Gone to tell the parson to get ready to marry him; and how he did skip along, to be sure! I always thought Billy, our goat, could jump [25]   better than anybody else, but he's no match for Henry, after all. Yet who knows how Master Billy would skip and jump if it was his wedding-day?
Wal. Ha! ha! ha!—You little rogue!—Come and give your old father a kiss.

[Page 10]
Enter Jane from the cottage, dressed as a bride. Jane. (C.) Good morrow to my dear father, and my little darling, Robinette.
                                         [Kisses her sister, who retires up to look out for Henry. Wal. (L.) Heaven bless thee, my child, on this eventful morning of thy life! 'Tis an important step thou art about to take.
Jane. But one which I feel confident I never shall have reason to repent of.
Wal. With Heaven's blessing! I know that both prudence and inclination dictate thy choice; Henry is a worthy youth, and with him thou wilt be happy.
Jane.
If bounteous Heaven smiles on innocence,—
If duty to our parents can call down
The blessings of that God, who did command
Children to honour those who gave them being,—
I trust your Jane has herein done her duty. Wal.
Thou art, indeed, my own, my dearest Jane!
Make but thy husband happy as thy father,
And he will never rue the day that bound him
In wedlock's chains: he'll find them cords of love,
Not fetters of restraint. Jane.
[50]   Fear not, my father. Love shall weave his chains
Of softest silk; he shall not feel their weight. Wal.
Now, my dear girl, take from thy aged father
The wholesome lessons of experience.
Thy future husband is thy lover now:
Be it thy care to keep him still the same
When he's thy husband. Be a thrifty wife;
Make his home comfortable; let him find,
When he returns from labour faint and weary,
A hearty welcome, and a smiling face.
If cares have ruffled him, do thou with love,—
Not curiosity to know the cause,—
Chase trouble from him, like a misty cloud
Before the radiant sun. Ever through life
Mark well my words, and take thy father's counsel
As a rich dowry. Jane.
Deep in this heart your counsel is engrav'd,
And I will guard it as a sacred treasure.
Yet, should I need a model in my state
Of happy wedlock, where could one be found
More perfect than the parents whom I honour'd?
I need but love my husband as my mother
[Page 11]

Lov'd you; and he must be a wretch indeed
Who could requite such love with aught but love. Rob. [Runs forward, clapping her hands.]
Father, here's
[75]   Henry coming!—He's coming! he's coming! Enter Henry , dressed as a bridegroom, R. U. E. Hen. (L. C.) [Embracing Jane.]
All is in readiness, my dearest Jane;
Our friends assembled, and the priest prepar'd
To call down Heaven's blessing on our loves. Jane. (R.)
Why tarry, then, so long, my dearest Henry? Hen.
I had return'd before, but on my way
I chanc'd to meet an ancient wither'd woman:
The path was narrow, and, as I tripp'd along,
Light as young Cupid on the wings of love,
I struck against the dame, and was the cause
That she did kiss the earth against her will.
Joy and high expectation spurr'd me on,
While charity commanded me to stay,
And help the poor old creature up again.
Returning, I obey'd, and found the beldam
Grinning with spite, and muttering maledictions.
“Your pardon, dame,” quoth I. “Peace, lout!” she cried;
“I know thee well—this is thy wedding-day;
But may it prove to thee a time of sorrow!
May jealousy torment thee day and night!
May thy wife prove a shrew—a thriftless wanton!
Thy children beg of callous hearts their bread
From door to door!—And may thy ev'ry joy
Be blasted ere it reach maturity!”
Thus the hag mutter'd,
[100]   While her malicious palsied head kept time
To the terrific music of her tongue.
Her maledictions struck my soul with horror,—
My ear revolted at her hellish prayer!
And, ere the foul fiend seal'd it with her Amen,
I fled from curses to these loving arms,
Where blessings—heavenly blessings, are my lot!                                          [Embraces Jane. Jane.
Heed not the powers of darkness, dearest Henry:
'Twere ill with virtue, if her Friend above
Were not more mighty than her enemies. Wal. (L.)
Heaven bless you both, my children!
Ha! those sounds                                          [Rustic music heard without.
[Page 12]

Proclaim the coming of our worthy neighbours
To greet the happy pair, and share our joy. Enter Villagers, dancing to pipes and tabors, led on by young Edwin and Amy , L. U. E. Wal. (R.) Welcome, kind neighbours, all. This is the happiest day of my life!
                                         [Going to meet the Villagers. Edw. (L. C.) What, happier than your own wedding-day, father Walter?
Wal. No, I do not exactly mean that; but—no matter. So you are going to be married, too, Master Edwin? Well, I wish you joy with all my heart;—the more weddings the better.
Amy. (L.) [Courtesying.] Yes, neighbour Walter; my dear Edwin is going to be married to me, and I to him, if you've no objection.
Edw. [125]   Yes, we're both going to be married together, if you've no objection.
Wal. None in the world. [Drinks.] And here's success to you, and all of us. Come, Henry and Jane, my dears, don't let our worthy guests want for refreshments; hand round the nutbrown ale.
Rob. (R. C.) Yes, and I'll wait upon the company, too, father; because I shall want waiting upon myself one of these days, when I get married.
Wal. You get married, indeed, you little gipsy!— But, Jane, my love, have you seen Lord Raymond lately?
Jane. (C.) Not since the day on which you sent me with a letter to the castle.
Hen. (R. C.)
Go not again. Lord Raymond is a man
Whom, of all others, ev'ry honest female
Should shun. He is a lawless libertine. Wal. Hush, thoughtless youth, and teach thy tongue discretion!
Enter Buckram , the village Tailor, in a holyday suit, L. S. E. Buc. (C.) Ah, my honest friend, Walter, how dost do? Most obedient, neighbours all. Much joy to the happy couple. Henry, my boy, how d'ye like your wedding clothes? [Turns him round and round.] There's a suit for you!—a dress fit for a lord! Pearl buttons—plush lining—every stitch sewed with silk, by your most obedient [150]   very humble servant, Billy Buckram, professor of
[Page 13]
the noble art of cutting up and contriving, at your service. Hem! Apropos, have you heard the news?
                                         [Henry, Jane, and Guests, retire to take refreshments. Wal. [Aside.] Mercy on us, what a tongue!
Buc. Most wonderful news. Do you know they talk of a war between— [Crosses to R.] —Your coat, waistcoat, and small-clothes, do set remarkably well, neighbour Walter,—another proof of my genius! Apropos, of course you know what an accident has befallen old Justice Stubblefield?
Wal. I think you'd better partake of our hospitality than waste the precious time in gossipping. Come, what say you to a cup of ale?—Choice home-brewed beverage?
Buc. With all my heart; and, while we quaff the enlivening potion, I'll tell you all the news.
                                         [They retire to the table. Hen. [Coming forward.]
At length the happy hour is arriv'd,—
That blissful hour, which in anticipation
So often prov'd the solace of my soul,
In times of gloom and sadness!                                          [Glancing at Jane.
How beautiful—how heavenly she looks!
Her eyes do seem to beam ethereal mildness,
Transporting my fond soul, as in a trance,
To realms of bliss too rich for mortal man!
To call an angel mine—for ever mine!
[175]   Oh, Henry!—happy Henry!
What is an emperor's bliss compar'd with thine? Enter Old Francis , R. U. E. Fra. (R.) God save ye, my worthy neighbours all!— Ah, is that you, young Master Henry? So, I see you are all merry-making here, and in your best holyday suits. I say, friend Walter, I've something from Lord Raymond for your private ear. We must be left alone.
Wal. (C.) Welcome, my honest Francis! Henry, and my friends, retire a moment.
Hen. (L. C.)
You'll not be long. Perhaps you know not, Francis,
This day will be recorded in my memory
To the last hour of life's eventful scene,
As that on which I sipp'd the sweetest honey
Which ever hung upon a woman's lips.
It is my wedding-day.
[Page 14]
Fra. Is it possible? Ah, you cunning rogue! your's is the time of life for weddings. I wish you joy with all my heart! [Aside.] I thought 'twas rather mysterious, and I'm glad I've got at the bottom of it.
Jane. (L.) Dear father, waste not in business those precious moments which love claims as its due.
                                         [Exit with Henry and Guests into the cottage. Buc. (L.) [To Old Francis.] Apropos, Master Francis, I think 'tis almost time you had new liveries at the castle; this you've got on begins to look rather threadbare.
Fra. We wish to be alone, good neighbour Buckram.
Buc. [200]   Oh, by all means; but, whenever you've need of my services, you have only to command me. Any and every thing, from a court-dress to a smock-frock, is perfectly in my way. Pearl buttons—plush lining— every stitch sewed with silk, by your most obedient very humble servant, Billy Buckram.
                                         [Exit into the cottage, bowing. Wal. (L. C.) That fellow's tongue is a match for all the old gossips in the village. But what says Lord Raymond?
Fra. (R. C.) He greets you, and expects you at the castle on business of importance.
Wal. I pray you, Francis, excuse me to his lordship.
Fra. Impossible; you know his lordship's violent temper well. Moreover, recollect you are considerably in arrears for rent, and therefore in his power; so do not delay to obey his lordship's summons on the instant. 'Tis a very mysterious affair altogether, if one could but get at the bottom of it.
Wal. I am his lordship's debtor, it is true; and therefore must obey this most unwelcome summons.
Fra. On the instant, d'ye hear?                                          [Going, but returning.] And—What an old headpiece I have got! I had well nigh forgotten the main point—the very quintescence of my errand. Your fair daughter Jane, she is to accompany you. I will report your coming to his [225]   lordship, [Aside] and then I'll hide me in the closet, and listen to their discourse; no doubt I shall very soon get at the bottom of it.
                                         [Exit, R. U. E. Wal.
My Jane go with me!—This is very strange.
Lord Raymond is so fond of love intrigues,—
I feel alarm'd—yet shall I not be with her?
And who dares offer insult to my darling?                                          [The village clock strikes twelve.
[Page 15]
Enter Jane, Henry, Edwin, Amy , and the Guests, except Buckram, from the cottage. Hen. (L. C.) There, said I not so? 'Tis past twelve o'clock, nor can we now be married till to-morrow.
Jane. (L. C.) This is, indeed, unkind of you, my father.
Edw. (L.) Ay, and see what we've got by waiting for you; I'm disappointed as well.
Amy. (C.) Yes, and I too. Oh, I shall cry my eyes out!
Edw. No don't, lovey; they are far too pretty for that.
Wal. (R.) The fault's not mine, my friends. Lord Raymond has commanded Jane instantly to repair to his castle.
Hen.
What! my dear Jane, alone and unprotected? Wal.
No, my dear boy; her father goes with her. Hen.
Ay, and I too, by Heaven!
You might as well send a poor innocent lamb
Into the den of a gaunt hungry wolf,
As a young female, lovely and alone,
To this Lord Raymond's castle. Wal.
[250]   Fear not, my boy; we'll stand or fall together. Jane.
Come, my dear Henry. What need we fear?
Lord Raymond is a great and powerful man;
Yet, should he offer violence, he'll find
That England's laws are mightier far than he.                                          [Exeunt, R. U. E. SCENE II. —Gothic Chamber in Lord Raymond's Castle, with window, L.—Chairs brought on. Enter Lord Raymond , followed by a Servant, R. D. Lord R. (L.)
You say old Francis is not yet returned. Ser. (R.)
Not yet, my lord. Lord R.
When he arrives, fail not to send him hither.                                          [Servant bows, and exit, L. D.
Rich, noble, powerful, who would refuse
Alliance with Lord Raymond?
My father's death hath freed me from restraint,
And I no longer, like a truant boy,
Need fear the rod of discipline. I now
Will taste the joys of sensuality:
The richest luxuries the earth can yield,
The fairest flowers from beauty's lovely garden,—
[Page 16]

The most mellifluent strains of harmony,
Shall court my ev'ry sense with new delights.
I'll quaff the cup of pleasure to the dregs;
Live, like the flutt'ring insect of a day,
Basking in sunshine, reckless of the future,
And die in ecstacy! [Starts.] No—die—I cannot!
That single word freezes my ardent blood!
What means this palpitation of the heart,—
This ague-fit that seizes on my limbs?
It is that bugbear, Conscience. Hence, intruder!
Go, lecture beardless boys and toothless dotards!
Lord Raymond is a man—he heeds thee not. Enter Lady Jane Raymond , R. S. E. Lady J. (R.)
Good-morrow, my dear brother. Lord R. (L.)
[25]   Kind thanks, dear Jane; you rose betimes to-day. Lady J.
The morning was so lovely, that to waste it
In the dull arms of sleep would have been folly.
Besides, to speak the truth, there is a something,
Which, like a load of lead, weighs down my spirits,
And kills my peace of mind.                                          [Sighs. Lord R.
The cause, dear Jane; no secrets from your brother. Lady J.
Reserve were wrong, where confidence is due;
And therefore will I, to a loving brother,
Relate the simple story of my grief.
'Twas but last evening, as I wander'd forth
To view the glories of the setting sun,
Just as I reach'd the borders of the forest,
Two black, determin'd, savage-looking men,
With threat'ning gestures and uplifted daggers,
Appear'd before me.
“Hold!” in a thund'ring voice, one of them cried,
While his companion seiz'd me in his arms.
I scream'd aloud—resistance was in vain.
Attracted by my cries, swift as an arrow
My guardian angel came,—a comely youth,
Who, with the fury of an angry lion,
Rush'd on the villains. One he straight disarm'd,
And with his weapon slew the other ruffian,
Who dared insult an unprotected woman. Lord R.
[50]   He must have been a brave and hardy youth. Lady J.
Ay, and as lovely, too, as he was brave.
[Page 17]

Oh, my dear brother, spite of shame, I own
That he who sav'd my honour won my heart. Lord R.
Be cautious, Jane. Yet say, who was the youth? Lady J.
Alas! I know not. As soon as he beheld
Me safe, he fled, light as the sportive fawn,
Across the plain, and scarcely took my thanks. Lord R.
A strange adventure, this. Lady J.
Could I but once again behold the youth,
And prove my gratitude by deeds, not words,
I should be happy!                                          [Crosses to the window, L.
What do I see? 'Tis he!—
My brave deliverer coming up the lawn!
A maiden, too, link'd with him arm-in-arm.
I hope she is his sister: no, she's not!
That look was far too tender—sisters gaze not thus.
Now they advance—he fondly grasps her hand,
And, as they, light as fairies, trip along,
She reads heaven's language in his lovely eyes,
And hears its music flowing from his tongue.
Oh, happy maid! how do I envy thee!                                          [Sinks on a chair. Lord R.
Romantic nonsense! [Crossing to the window.] Why, 'tis young Henry.
Sister, arise, and be not folly's dupe.
You would not surely throw away your hand
[75]   Upon a peasant boy?                                          [He raises her from the chair. Lady J.
Forgive me, my dear brother;
I feel my error, and will strive to conquer
This ill-judg'd passion.
Yet, should the struggle break this loving heart,
I claim a brother's pity!                                          [Exit, R. Lord R.
I cannot pity thee, for pity is
A stranger to my nature. If, good sister,
Thou needs wilt play the fool, do so—I care not;
It concerns not me. Enter Old Francis , L. D. Fra. My lord, your tenant Walter is without.
Lord R. (R.) And his fair daughter, Jane, is she with him?
Fra. She is, my lord. I found them all merry-making and right jovially inclined—going to get married, forsooth, in full gallop, as one might say. It seemed rather mysterious, but I very soon got at the bottom of it.
Lord R. Send Walter hither.

[Page 18]
Fra. I will, my gracious lord. [Aside.] And then for my hiding-place in the closet; for I'm determined to get at the bottom of it.
                                         [Exit, L. D. Lord R.
Why blame my sister? Do I act more wisely?
What is this girl who hath bewitch'd my senses?
A peasant's child—no more. But what of that?
We men may have our follies and amours,
[100]   And go unpunish'd by the partial world;
But woman's steps are watch'd with Argus' eyes,
And, if she act imprudently but once,
She forfeits honour, and is lost for ever. Enter Walter , L. D. Wal. (L.)
Obedient to your summons I am come,
To learn your lordship's pleasure. Lord R. (R.)
You are aware, no doubt, that there's a debt
Of some five hundred crowns between us, Walter? Wal.
There is, my lord. Lord R.
Are you prepar'd to pay it? Wal.
Not at present. Lord R.
I'm sorry for it; for I hold it wrong
That those who are in debt should feast and riot
At other people's charge. Wal.
My lord, we are not given to excess.
This is a joyful day, and I— Lord R.
I understand—some holyday, perhaps.
You have a daughter. Wal.
I have, indeed, my lord; a dear good child. Lord R.
Ay, and as beautiful as she is good.
I've news for thee—such news, my honest graybeard,
As will delight the dull cold ear of age,
And make thy oozing wimpering eyes once more
Sparkle with youthful lustre. Know, then, since
By my late father's death, as well as birthright,
[125]   Being now possess'd of power and wealth, I mean
To do you honour, and take your daughter Jane
Under my kind protection. Wal.
My lord, my daughter Jane needs no protection
While her old father lives, and England's laws
Remain the poor man's shield against oppression. Lord R.
Old man, you do not seem to understand me.
I love your daughter Jane, and feel inclin'd— Wal.
To marry her, my lord?
[Page 19]
Lord R. [Smiling.]
No, not exactly that. Wal. [Going abruptly.]
Good day, my lord. Lord R. [Stamping violently.]
Stay, dotard!—I command thee,
On pain of ling'ring till thou rott'st in gaol!
Yet I'll dissemble with the drivelling fool,                                          [Aside.
And if, by a mock marriage, I can gain
My ends, and lull his scruples, 'twere as well.
Suppose I were inclin'd to wed your Jane.                                          [To Walter. Wal.
My Jane, my lord!—What, a poor peasant girl! Lord R.
Her beauty is her dowry. If I chuse
To make the girl my wife, who shall gainsay me? Wal.
No one, most surely. Yet—you'll pardon me,
My Jane is promis'd, and her banns proclaim'd. Lord R.
Psha! driveller! Is she promis'd to a lord?
Hast thou no feeling of ambition in thee?
Does not the name of honour warm thy heart? Wal. [150]   Not the mere name of honour, my lord, but the thing itself; and if your lordship means, by an honourable heart, an honest one, dam'me but I'd show hearts with the proudest nobleman in the kingdom!
Lord R.
Thou art a strange old-fashion'd simpleton,
And blind to thine own interest. Where's your daughter?
Think you her love will stand the test of gold?
Go send her hither—you have naught to fear:
I fain would try if I, by a fair offer,
Can win the maiden's heart. Wal. My lord, I do obey. Confiding in your honour, I'll send my darling hither, that she may be in all things free to act. [Aside—going.] I know my child too well— her love is true—gold will not dazzle her.
                                         [Exit, L. D. Lord R.
'Twere scarcely worth the trouble; had not nature,
In a plebeian mood, to vex the rich,
Sent this poor peasant girl into the world,
Deck'd out with all the mastery of her art,
Lavishing on her such a world of charms,
That men, in gazing on perfection's model,
Forget themselves. It is not love that prompts,—
Her beauty dazzles me; and I will have her,
E'en at the hazard of my soul. She comes. Enter Jane , L. D. Jane. (L.) [Timidly.]
What is your lordship's pleasure?
[Page 20]
Lord R. (R.)
To see thee, Jane, and live but in thy smiles. Jane. [Embarrassed.]
[175]   My lord! Lord R.
Nay, be not coy; throw off this cold reserve,
And let those eyes smile on me. It is true,
I have been wont to stray from flow'r to flow'r,
Inconstant as the gaudy butterfly,
But thou hast fix'd my heart to one dear object,—
It is thyself. I mean to wed thee, Jane:
What say you? Wilt thou have me for a husband? Jane.
My lord, I cannot think you serious;
And yet to jest, where jesting wounds the heart,
Is cruel. Lord R.
I have been told a love-tale touching you;
Such a romantic ditty as we read of
In books, the offspring of some madman's brain.
Thus ran the story—listen, pretty Jane:
Being poor yourself, you needs must fall in love
With a poor youth, comely and brave, no doubt;
And then you wander through the silent grove,                                          [Takes her arm.
Thus arm-in-arm, sighing your souls away;
Or sit by moonlight in some fragrant bower,
While the melodious nightingale pours forth
Her dulcet harmony. All this, of course;
'Twere not romantic else.
Now I deal not in fancy's flimsy wares,—
Reality for me. I offer you,
[200]   For shadow, substance: what is your reply? Jane.
My lord, I pray you, seek not to destroy
That humble bliss which is my happy lot,
Yet makes me richer than the proudest monarch. Lord R.
I'll hold the balance of thy future fortune
Up to thy view. In one scale will I weigh
My own pretensions, whilst thou, in the other,
Mayst throw the merits of this poor peasant, Henry,
Whom thou so dearly lov'st. Now to begin.
Lord Raymond is a rich and powerful nobleman.                                          [Pointedly. Jane. [Quickly responding.]
Henry, a happy and contented peasant. Lord R.
I keep a stately chariot, to convey me
From place to place. Jane.
Henry has youth and strength to carry him
Where'er he wants to go.
[Page 21]
Lord R.
I possess gold. Jane.
And Henry, honesty!                                          [Crosses to R. Lord R.
Psha!
That's worse than nothing, as the world goes now.
Do you refuse my offer? Jane.
Nay, good my lord, that were too harsh a term:
I do decline the honour you intend me. Lord R. [Aside.]
Perdition on this Henry! [Crosses to R.] He hath gain'd
Possession of the loveliest heart on earth!
But I will trample on my peasant rival,
[225]   And crush the worm to atoms!
Yet shall dissimulation be my mantle,
Until my schemes are ripe. [To Jane.] I do admire,
Fair maid, the constancy of thy attachment,
And rest thy friend, though not thy loving husband. Jane.
My lord, your kindness overpowers me. [Aside, and going.]
Thank heaven, the trial's pass'd, and love has triumph'd!                                          [Exit, L. D. Lord R.
Prefer a paltry peasant to Lord Raymond!
This insult calls for deadly, black revenge!
Spirit of darkness, I invoke thy aid!
And, if there be within thy fiery realm
One demon more malicious than the rest,
Send him to take possession of this heart!
Let Nero be to me in cruelty
A very babe!—Let me not shrink to see
The blood of innocence this hand may shed;
And let the cries of widows and of orphans
Be in mine ears the most melodious music!
Success!—My prayer is heard!                                          [Laying his hand on his heart.
The demon I invok'd is here already! Enter Old Francis , with a letter, L. D. Fra. (L.) An't please your lordship— [Aside.] —Mercy on us! how ghastly he looks!—'Tis vastly strange!—I should like to get at the bottom of it!
Lord R. (R.) [Not noticing Old Francis.] Yes! yes!— I feel it plainly: the devil's here!
Fra. [Falling on his knees, and clasping his hands.] [250]   Mercy on us!—The devil here!—Where—where, my l-o-r-d?
Lord R. Peace, simpleton! What hast thou in thy hand?
Fra. Not the de-v-il, my lord, but a letter.
                                         [Rises, and gives the letter.
[Page 22]
Lord R. [Reads.] “My Lord,—You are hereby directed, as Lord Lieutenant of the county of Westmoreland, to call out the armed yeomanry, and instantly march to attack the rebels, who have crossed the borders.— Harcourt , Secretary of State.”

'Tis well. This letter comes most opportunely:
This privilege to murder is most kind;
For scenes of blood are suited to my mind.                                          [Exit, R. D. Fra. Mysterious—vastly mysterious! What could his lordship mean by saying, just as I entered the room, the devil's here? Mercy on us! it makes me tremble all over! [Looking fearfully around.] I don't see him any where, and heaven forbid I should! I trust the saints will defend us, and keep the devil at home. [Pointing below.] Ah, that's a place I don't wish to get at the bottom of.
                                         [Exit, L. Enter Henry hastily, L. S. E., in search of Jane. Hen.
Jane—my dear Jane!—where art thou? Enter Lady Jane , in equal haste, R. S. E., meeting Henry. Lady J. (R.)
I am here. [Recollects herself, and endeavours to conceal her confusion. Hen. (L.) [Bowing respectfully.]
My lady, pardon this intrusion. I—
The lady whom I rescued from the robbers!                                          [Aside. Lady J.
Young man, I'm under obligations to you,
Which are a burden I would fain discharge. Hen.
[275]   Lady, you owe me nothing: what I did
Was but my duty—there's no merit in it.
That man must be a wretch, unfit to live,
Or bear the human form, who would not gladly
Hazard e'en life itself to save from insult
An unprotected woman. Lady J.
Generous youth! Is, then, my debt discharg'd?
I would that all who languish now in prison,
The victims of misfortune or oppression,
Had creditors as merciful. Hen.
Good my lady,
Your approbation is the sole reward
I crave; and so most humbly take my leave.                                          [Going. Lady J.
One word yet, gen'rous youth, before we part.
The maiden who accompanied you hither,—
She is your sister, is she not?
[Page 23]
Hen.
Not so, my lady. She is— Lady J.
A cousin, then, perhaps, or— Hen.
Oh, no, my lady; she is my own dear Jane!
I would not for the world she were my sister,
Or anything but what she soon will be,—
My loving wife! Oh, happy—happy thought!                                          [Lady Jané reclines on a chair.
My lady, why this tremor? Are you ill?
Shall I go call assistance? Lady J.
This weakness is unpardonable in me.                                          [Aside.
[300]   'Twas but a faintness—it will soon be over.
Here, generous youth, accept this as a token
Of my esteem.                                          [Offers a purse. Hen.
If I decline your offer, 'tis because
I'm young and strong to labour for subsistence;
While there are thousands who are old and feeble,
To whom your charity would give new life.                                          [Going to the window, L.
'Tis she!—My Jane!—She beckons me to come,
Impatience in her looks! I must away;
'Tis treason, when love calls, to disobey.                                          [Bows respectfully, and exit, L. D. Lady J. [Crossing to window, L.]
Henry has already reach'd the lawn;
His Jane receives him with a fond embrace;
Now, on the wings of love, they fly along!
Oh, happy pair!—May troubles ne'er annoy,
Nor clouds obscure the sunshine of your joy!                                          [Exit, R. SCENE III. —Exterior of Walter's Cottage. Robinette and Buckram discovered at the table eating and drinking. Rob. (R.) Come, Mr. Buckram, I think you've had enough now for a tailor.
Buc. (L.) Only another cup of ale, my dear, and then I shall do remarkably well.
Rob. [Archly.] About a thimble full, I suppose.
Buc. A pert young hussy! A thimble full, indeed!
Rob. [Pours out some ale, offers it to Buckram, but first drinks herself.] Here's your very good health, Master Snippy; and I wish you a plentiful crop of cabbage, with all my heart!
Buc. [Taking the cup.] Saucy young minx! Why, my dear, this cup is not a quarter full.

[Page 24]
Rob. No matter; it's more than enough for the ninth part of a man. Ha! ha! ha!
                                         [Runs from the table. Buc. Pert little devil! [Rises in a pet.] The ninth part of a man! 'Tis ridiculous in me to mind such stuff, but, somehow or other, such insolence always throws me into a pucker. [Running after Robinette.] Why, you audacious little baggage!—you insignificant little hop-o'-my-thumb!—how dare you call me the ninth part of a man? If I catch you, I'll—
Enter Walter, Jane, Henry , and Villagers, R. U. E. Wal. (C.) Lord Raymond's proposal really astonished me. I always thought him partial to my Jane; but never dreamt that he intended honourable marriage.
Hen. (L.)
Nor does he—I would stake my life upon it.
[25]   'Tis but a scheme to rob me of my happiness. Wal. Nay, Henry, judge not rashly. When his lordship heard Jane's resolve, he proffered her his friendship.
Hen.
That offer fills my mind with apprehensions. Jane. (L. C.)
Fear not a lord, my Henry: thou'rt to me
More than an emperor—ay, though he were
The monarch of the world. Buc. (R.) Well, honest Walter, so you're returned again. What measures have you taken, eh? Any news stirring at the castle? Do tell us all about it; hav'nt heard a syllable of news since ten o'clock this morning.
Wal.
I have no news that's pleasing, neighbour Buckram.                                          [Trumpet sounds to arms without.
What means that martial sound? Buc. A declaration of peace, or a proclamation of war, I dare say. I long to hear the particulars.
Enter Edwin , running, R. U. E. Edw. (C.) Oh, dear! oh, dear!—Here's a pretty business! —Instead of our getting married, they're going to take us all for soldiers.
Buc. What, tailors and all?
Edw. Ay, every soul of us. We are all to march directly to fight the rebels. But here comes Lord Raymond.
                                         [Grand flourish.
[Page 25]
Enter Lord Raymond in armour, with troops and attendants, R. U. E. Lord R.
We march directly: all, without exception,
Who are not aged or infirm, will join
The yeomanry. It is the queen's command.                                          [Retires up. Buc. [Begins coughing violently, and suddenly pretends to be lame.] [50]   I'm one that's not fit for a soldier, however.— This church-yard cough and poor lame leg of mine will be the death of me. Good bye, neighbours.
                                         [Hobbles off, R.—Eugene, a yeomanry officer, follows him. Lord R. (C.) [Advancing to Jane.]
It grieves me, lovely Jane, that I'm compell'd
To tear your Henry from you. We all go;
And Henry, in the field of bloody strife,
May prove him worthy of so good a wife.                                          [Trumpets and drums sound to arms. Hen.
Fear not, my love; though duty calls me hence,
We soon shall meet again. Jane.
I will go with thee. Though but a weak maiden,
I fear not death. No!—In the battle-field,
This eye shall be thy sword—this heart thy shield!
Away!                                          [Crossing to R., is met by Lord Raymond. Lord R.
It cannot be, fair maid; yet, thy dear Henry
Can write thee love-epistles from the camp,
And thus beguile the time till he returns. Jane.
Kind thanks, my lord; and I've a messenger
To bring the tender tidings. For a moment
I crave your patience. [ Music .—Exit into cottage, then re-enters with a cage, in which are two doves; she takes out one of them, and gives it to Henry.
Here, Henry, is the messenger I spoke of;
And, trust me, he'll not loiter on his way:
For here's his mate. [Pointing to the other dove in the cage.] They are a loving pair,
And separation would be death to both.
Fate tears him from his love, and thee from me;
In that there's much resemblance between us.
[75]   When thou hast written what thy heart dictates,
Then tie thy letter, with a silken cord,
Under his downy pinions, and he'll fly,
Swift as an arrow on the wings of love,
To her his heart holds dear. His tender mate
[Page 26]

I'll keep within my bosom; she'll need comfort
Till her true love returns. Enter Old Francis , L. U. E. Fra. (C.) An't please ye, where is the brave youth who saved my lady's life? [Seeing Henry.] Ah, now I see him. [To Henry.] Here, young man, her ladyship greets you, and sends you this picture of herself, in token of her gratitude.
[Henry kneels—Francis hangs the picture around his neck, where Jane's picture hangs already. Lord R. (L.) [Aside.]
Her gratitude! Her love, she should have said.
Ah, sister, thou art caught! Wal.
Come, Francis, take a cup of ale with us. Fra. Ay, marry will I; a cup of good ale is what I like, and, never fear, I shall very soon get at the bottom of it.
Lord R.
We can delay no longer; time is precious. Hen.
Dearest Jane, farewell!                                          [Embraces. Jane. [Sobs.]
Farewell, dear Henry! Lord R. [Aside.]
E'en take thy last embrace, fond doting pair!
Henry, thy doom is fix'd!—Be that my care.
March! [The Yeomanry march off across the hills—Henry, holding up the dove, exchanges love salutations with Jane—Edwin and Amy do the same—Lord Raymond expresses his satisfaction in a demoniac smile—Buckram is dragged on by Eugene, and forced to follow the troops.

END OF ACT I.
ACT II. SCENE I. —The open Country. Enter Ethelbert and Hardolf , cautiously, R. S. E. Eth. (L.) Hush!—Methought I heard the trampling of horses; if so, we must be on the alert. Where is Fernwold?
Har. (R.) Gone foraging for provisions. 'Tis high time, I'm sure, we had something in the shape of a dinner, or the crows will very shortly make a meal of us.
Eth. Very true, Hardolf; we are, indeed, a set of poor miserable wretches.

[Page 27]
Har. How so, captain?
Eth. Why, look ye: first of all, the tyranny of the great, who rule the land with an iron sceptre, forced us to take up arms in our own defence; that they call rebellion, and send their soldiers to cut us down like grass. Now, we are reduced by defeat and ill-success to wander about the country, and take whatever we can find, to satisfy the cravings of nature—that they call robbery; so that, look which way we will, death stares us in the face; for none but a fool would expect mercy from Lord Raymond.
Har. Why, then, stand thus shillishalli? Since tyranny has reduced us to such extremity, why not declare war against the whole human race at once? I only wish my comrades had chosen me for their leader; I'll wager they'd have been a devilish deal better off than they are now.
Eth. [25]   Thou art no flatterer, Hardolf, to tell me this to my face. However, if our comrades repent their choice, they can easily fix upon some one else; but this I am resolved on—as long as I am their commander, our swords shall never be drawn against the defenceless.
Har. What! not if we are starving?
Eth. No, not even then. Better to die by inches than have innocent blood to answer for.
                                         [Crosses to L. Har. (R.) Ha! ha! ha! Do the tyrants who oppress us think so? Where is there a more cruel and merciless villain than Lord Raymond?
Eth. Let him look to himself—I'll not imitate him. Yet live we must; and, whenever we happen to meet with a haughty lord, a purse-proud citizen, an overfed parson, or a lawyer laden with plunder, I'll be the very first to attack and ease them of their superfluous pelf; but never let me catch a man under my command offering the least violence to the poor. If I do, death shall be his portion.
Har. Well, don't be angry, captain. [Aside.] A stupid fool!—I wish I was leader! But, see, here comes Fernwold.
Enter Fernwold , and others of the Rebel Party, L. Fer. (L.) The queen's troops, headed by that remorseless tyrant, Lord Raymond, have discovered our retreat, and are hastening hither to rob us of all we have left in
[Page 28]
[50]   the world—our lives. Away!—We have not a moment to lose.
Eth. Now, then, my gallant comrades, be firm. If we shrink from danger, we know our doom. The mountain pass is the only way now left us to life and liberty. Away!
                                         [Exeunt, R. S. E. Enter Lord Raymond, Henry, Edwin , Officers, and troops, L. S. E.—Grand Flourish. Lord R. (C.)
If our information be correct,
The remnant of the rebels are now lurking
About these parts; not daring openly
To face us in the field, but plundering,
Assassin like, the poor defenceless traveller.
To your posts; and show no mercy to the wretches.
Rush on, and cut them down!—For, when the poor
Rebel, they are but whetstones to our swords.
Murmur they may—ay, and petition too,
And humbly beg redress on bended knee;
But, if impatiently they fly to arms,
To fight for what we prudently deny them,
We then let loose our bloodhounds, to destroy
Their lives and hopes at once. 'Tis policy.                                          [Trumpet without. Enter an Officer, L. Offi. My lord, a party of the rebels have been observed making in haste towards the mountain pass.
Lord R.
We'll intercept them by a nearer path.
Some men, when cross'd in love, lose charity,                                          [To Henry.
And hate their rivals; yet we will be friends,
[75]   Though we do both adore one lovely object,
A maiden worthy of a monarch's throne.
You she prefers, despising all advantage
Of fortune. Honour, therefore, now compels me
To think no more of her. Yet, favour'd youth,
I feel an earnest interest in your welfare,
And will, if you deserve it, which I doubt not,
Do all I can to further your promotion. Hen. (R.)
My lord, your kindness is a spur to action.
Give me a post of honour and of danger;
And, if I shrink from death, hold me a wretch,
Unworthy of Jane's love and your protection.                                          [Bows. Lord R.
'Tis well. Then hasten to the narrow pass,
[Page 29]

Through which the rebels mean to cut their way.
Their numbers are but few, yet desperation
Will make them fight like lions. Hen.
And lions they shall find to combat with.
Away!                                          [Exeunt all but Lord Raymond, R. Lord R.
Enthusiastic idiot! Go, fight on!
If thou escape, then to more desp'rate means
I'll have recourse. Assassination—ay,
Or poison! Anything to rid me of thee.
Fate, I am thine! If thou propitious prove,
Let Henry ne'er return to joy and love!                                          [Exit, R. Enter Eugene , L., driving Buckram on before. Eug. (L.) Come, move on, sirrah. I'll soon make a [100]   soldier of you. [Puts a helmet on Buckram's head, knocking it over his eyes.] Now, hang on your sword. [Buckram awkwardly obeys.] Why, I declare you look quite a different man altogether now.
Buc. (R.) [Coughing.] Now, pray, Mr. Officer, do consider—what use should I be in the field of battle, with this poor lame leg, and terrible churchyard cough?
                                         [Coughing. Eug. No hesitation, sir, or—
                                         [Raising his sword. Buc. Come, come, I say; take care what you're about with that great bodkin.
Eug. Will you march, I say? We shall be too late.
Buc. What, to get our throats cut? Plenty of time for that, believe me. But you will let me just stop to tie my shoe-string, won't you?
Eug. Not a moment. March, I say!
Buc. Oh, dear! what a terrible stitch that was in my side! Oh! I'm extremely ill! This is cruel usage for a poor, weak, lame, consumptive creature, like me!— Oh, dear! oh, dear!
                                         [Exit, driven off by Eugene, R. SCENE II. —A Romantic Pass in the Mountains—Alpine Bridge, &c. Enter Henry, Edwin , and Troops, L. U. E. Hen. (R. C.) This is the pass; yon bridge must be defended, cost what it will.
Edw. (L.) But, I say, Henry, if anything serious should happen to us, what would become of the poor girls at home? When do you intend to send off Mr. Pigeon, the postman, with a letter, eh?

[Page 30]
Hen. Soon as we know the issue of the combat. Where did you leave the pretty bird?
Edw. At our head-quarters, the village alehouse; and I told the hostess to be sure and give him plenty to eat.
Hen. Alas! poor thing; I fear he will not eat.
Edw. Why not? Because he is in love? So am I, too, over head and ears; yet my appetite's as good as ever it was. No, no: if I were to starve myself to death, I might as well be shot dead at once; and then what would poor Amy do? Our sweethearts are really to be pitied, poor girls; for, if they were to lose us, they might search the world through before they'd find two such nice, charming, agreeable young men, as you and I, Henry.
Hen.
Fear not, my friend.
Heaven will protect the man who does his duty;
And cowards are not worth a fair maid's love.                                          [Horn sounds without.
[25]   Hark!—The appointed signal. To the bridge!                                          [All advance to the bridge. Enter Eugene , driving Buckram along as before, L. Eug. (L.) Now to show your courage. This is the field of battle.
Buc. (R.) And a cursed ugly-looking field it is, too. Not a morsel of cabbage growing in it. Suppose, now, I were to climb up this tree; I could give you warning of danger, you know.
                                         [Offers to climb—Eugene pulls him down. Eug. No skulking, sir. To your post—follow me.
                                         [Retires to the bridge. Buc. To my post! I wish I was a post myself, or anything but what I am. Egad! I've a mind to put my best leg foremost, and—
[Is about to run off, R., when he is alarmed by the report of a musket; he then runs to L., and is driven back by a second shot; he scampers about, confused and terrified, and at length climbs up a tree for protection. Enter Ethelbert, Hardolf, Fernwold , and Rebels, R. Eth. (R.) Now, my brave companions in misfortune, to force the mountain pass, or perish in the attempt!—It is our only way to life and liberty.
                                         [Advances with his men to the bridge.
[Page 31]
Hen. [From the bridge.] Halt, rebels!—Yield, or die!
Eth. Never!
[A general combat; the rebels retreat, and draw the yeomanry from their position; they are at length compelled to retire, pursued by the rebels, R. Buc. [Peeping out.] There's precious work for you! The coast is clear, however, at last; so I'll descend, and make the best of my way home. [Comes down from the tree.] What folly it is to go to war!—As if there was any pleasure in a man's getting his throat cut, or a great button-hole made in his body! [Gun fired without.] Oh, dear! oh, dear!—There it goes again! Now, legs, be true as gold, and swift as lightning!
                                         [Runs off, L. Loud Alarum. Re-enter Hardolf, Fernwold , and several Rebels, with Henry , a prisoner, bound, R. S. E. Fer. (R.) So, you are compelled to yield at last, my [50]   fine fellow?
Hen. (C.) Since you are brave, be merciful as well; not for my sake, but the dear girl I love.
Har. (L.) Oh, you're in love, are you? Ha! ha! ha! But, come, let's see what you've got about you. [Observing Jane's and Lady Jane's pictures round Henry's neck.] A picture!—And here's another. [Tears them off his neck, and hangs them round his own.] Two devilish fine girls, upon my soul! You seem to have been a mighty favourite with the soft sex. How many sweethearts have you got in all, eh?
Hen. [Struggling.]
Unfeeling monsters!—Strip me—leave me nothing,
But that dear picture! Fer. So, one of them is your favourite, I suppose.— Poor girl, I pity her with all my heart! But say, youngster, have you got any money about you?
Hen. None—I am poor; yet, surely, poverty is not a sin.
Har. So great a sin, that you've no hope of mercy; so here goes.
                                         [Offers to despatch Henry. Enter Ethelbert , rushing between, with several followers, R. Eth. Hold!—Who dares harm that youth? He has fought bravely, and therefore should be by the brave respected. He is our prisoner—let that suffice. Convey him hence, well guarded. Away!

[Page 32]
Hen. Oh, for a sword, that I might cut my way, Through a whole host of foes, to her I love!
                                         [Exit Henry, guarded, R. Edw. [From the bridge.] [75]   This way, my lord. They were too many for us before; but now I think we are more than a match for them.
                                         [Grand flourish and alarum. Enter Lord Raymond , with Yeomanry, from the bridge.— The Rebels, after a short resistance, are subdued and bound. Lord R. (C.) Convey the miscreants hence, and guard them well.
Edw. (L.) [Looking round.] But where is Henry?
Har. (R. C.) If you mean that milk-faced lady-looking youth, who gave us so much trouble, he's safe enough.
Edw. What, a prisoner? Come, some of ye [To the Yeomen] ; we'll rescue him if he were in the clutches of the devil himself.
Lord R.
Stay, Edwin. I lament poor Henry's fate;
Yet, recollect we've prisoners to guard;
'Twere hazardous to leave them. Edw. What! let Henry remain in the hands of such cruel bloodthirsty monsters! No, never! To save my friend, damme but I'd disobey the queen herself, and take the consequences. So, come along, some of ye, to Henry's rescue. What! not a soul offers to stir! Well, no matter; give me but another sword for Henry, and here goes, single-handed, to save my dear friend's life, or perish in the attempt!
                                         [Exit, R. Lord R.
Hence with your prisoners,                                          [To the Yeomanry.
And wait for further orders at the inn,
[100]   Where we have fix'd our quarters.                                          [Pointing to Hardolf, who is still bound.
This miscreant I will myself examine.                                          [Exeunt all the Rebels but Hardolf, L., guarded by Yeomanry.
Come hither, fellow. If the countenance
Be, as some say, an index to the mind,
Thy heart must be one foul and loathsome mass
Of black deformity: thy scowling brow
Betrays the tempest of a troubled soul,
And stamps thee reprobate. What wouldst thou do
For life and liberty? Har. (L.)
Anything, my lord. Lord R.
These baubles I shall keep. [Taking the two miniatures from Hardolf's neck.] Yet I'll not rob thee,
[Page 33]

Though thou art a robber. There's ten times the value
Of such a paltry booty.                                          [Throws him a purse. Har. Your lordship's very gracious; but, unless my hands be untied, the purse may lie there till doomsday, ere I can take it up.
                                         [Tries in vain. Lord R.
If thou for gold wilt do a desperate deed,
I will unbind thee.                                          [Unbinds his hands. Har.
I'll do anything, my lord, for liberty— [Eagerly snatching up the purse.] —and money. Lord R.
Thou shalt have both. Now mark well what I say:
Shouldst thou betray me, thou, as rebel, diest
With thy companions. It would not avail thee
To say thou wert my hireling: thy oath
Would never gain belief 'gainst the mere word
Of Raymond. You beheld that youth—young Henry? Har.
[125]   I did, my lord. Lord R.
He is my bitterest enemy;
Yet from no private motive—that were wrong.
I fear he may prove dangerous to the state,
Through his great popularity, and wish
He were remov'd. You understand me well? Har.
Perfectly, my lord. And the reward— Lord R.
Should he be rescued, and thou do the deed,
A thousand crowns, besides thy life and freedom. Har.
Agreed! But I've no arms. Lord R. [Giving a dagger.]
Take thou this dagger. At the inn to-night,
When all are buried in the arms of sleep,
Thou canst perform thy task. Fear not detection;
I will protect thee from all consequences.
Trust thou my word.                                          [Crosses to L. Har.
And mine, my lord. Lord R.
Nay, I would rather trust that look of thine,
Which speaks hell's language plainer than thy tongue!
If thy hand falter at the bloody deed,
Let thine eye be its prompter, and the scene
Of murder will not halt.
Away!—Remember time and place.—Be firm! Har. Ay, as a rock, my lord. Yet, should I be questioned who 'twas unbound me, what am I to say?
Lord R.
Leave all to me.
[150]   The vilest rogues, supported by the great,
Are often used as instruments of state.                                          [Exeunt, L.
[Page 34]
SCENE III. —Outside of a Country Inn. Enter Buckram , L., running, quite out of breath, and splashed all over with mud. Buc. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I narrowly escaped being overtaken, by wading through a horse-pond. I declare I feel quite exhausted, and extremely uncomfortable.— Ah, here's a friendly inn.
                                         [Knocks. The Hostess appears at the window. Hos. Who's there?
Buc. A gentleman traveller, ma'am, in need of some refreshment. Open the door, if you please; I've not a moment to lose—I must be off.
Hos. You'll excuse me, sir, but I never open the door to any suspicious-looking characters in these troublesome times, especially when my husband's not at home.
Buc. Suspicious-looking characters! What do you mean, madam, by—But, no matter; you'll hand me a cup of sack through the window, I suppose, won't you?
Hos. Oh, certainly, sir, as many as you please.
                                         [Goes from the window. Buc. If she had but a civiller tongue in her head, this country hostess would be a nice comfortable woman enough. And her husband not at home! Egad! I've half a mind to jump in at the window, and pay her my respects. I never found a woman in my life that didn't fall desperately in love with me after five minutes' conversation. The lavish hand of nature must certainly have made me very engaging. Ah, here comes the charming hostess with my sack.
Hos. [25]   Here, sir, is a cup of as excellent sack as ever moistened a gentleman's lips, since the days of Adam and Eve.
Buc. [Smacks his lips.] Very acceptable—never was so dry—inside, I mean—in all my life.
                                         [Offers to take the wine. Hos. [Drawing back the cup, and holding out the other hand for money.] One shilling, sir, if you please.
Buc. Oh, very well, ma'am. 'Pon my word!— Pretty behaviour this, to a gentleman of my cloth!— But you shall have your shilling, ma'am—oh, yes!—I'd not have you for a moment imagine that a person of my respectability is without a shilling in his pocket. [Feels in his pockets.] Why, odds bodkins and shears!—How
[Page 35]
the devil is this? May I never stitch a button-hole again, but I left home in my hurry with empty pockets! I'm not master of a farthing!—But never mind: you'll trust me, ma'am—I know you will. I see good nature in your agreeable countenance.
Hos. None of your flattery, Mr. Snip. I'm not to be imposed upon by gentlemen of your cloth; for I neither take in swindlers, nor suffer them to take me in. Ah! here come the brave yeomanry, who have fixed their head-quarters with me. Now I shall not want for protection.
Buc. [Alarmed.] The yeomanry!—The devil!—That dreadful intelligence is enough to make a gentleman— run as fast as his legs can carry him.
                                         [Scampers off, R. Enter Eugene , with Yeomanry and Rebels, L., the latter bound. Hos. [Opening the door.]
[50]   Welcome, gentlemen; this way, if you please.                                          [Exeunt Hostess, Eugene, Yeomanry, and Rebels, into the inn. Enter Lord Raymond , followed by Hardolf , L. Lord R. (L.)
This is the inn—you know the rest.—Be firm.
What ho!                                          [Knocks at the door. Re-enter Hostess , courtesying. Lord R. [To Hardolf.]
Go in—I'll come anon.                                          [Exeunt Hostess and Hardolf into the inn.
Henry not yet return'd! 'Tis a good omen:
He may, perchance, ere this have met his fate,
Without my interference. Would it were so!
I then might reap the harvest of success
Without the stings of conscience. What an idiot
Am I to talk thus! Conscience, I defy thee!
Hence, with thy babbling!—thou spurious brat,
Of prejudice and superstition born!
I'll revel in delight until it cloys,
In spite of thee, thou mar-feast of man's joys!                                          [Exit into the inn.
[Page 36]
SCENE IV. —A Room in the Inn.—Two practicable doors in flat, with window, L.—over the Chimney-Piece, a loaded Gun, near which is Henry's Pigeon in a Cage. Eugene , Yeomanry, and Prisoners, discovered at table; Hardolf sitting apart, L., drinking, the Hostess , C., waiting on him. Eth. [Aside to Fernwold.] Our comrade, Hardolf, seems to have got mightily into favour with Lord Raymond. As sure as death, that scoundrel has betrayed all our secrets—I knew he was a villain.
Eug. [To the Yeomanry.] Retire, and take some refreshment. Guard well your prisoners; if but one escape, remember you answer for him with your lives.
                                         [Exeunt Yeomanry with Rebels, all but Hardolf, R. S. E. Hos. Ay, if they offer to stir, shoot the villains! I always keep a loaded gun in the house.
                                         [Exit, L. S. E. Har. A loaded gun!—Egad, I should like to render that harmless before I perform the task assigned me by Lord Raymond. I'll discharge it; and yon pigeon will serve both as an excuse and a mark to shoot at. [Takes the pigeon out of the cage, throws it out at the window, and fires.] Down he goes!—No—he mounts again—he's only wounded.
Enter Lord Raymond , R. D., Hostess , L., Eugene and Yeomanry, alarmed, R. Hos. (C.)
Murder! fire!—What's the matter? Lord R. (R.)
Have any of the prisoners escaped? Har. (L.) No, my lord; I only shot at a pigeon for my own amusement, that's all.
Hos. What, that pretty innocent little creature? Get out of my house directly, you cruel monster, you.
Lord R.
Nay, nay, good woman.
I know the man, and answer for his conduct.                                          [A loud knocking at L. D. without. Hos.
Who's there? Edwin. [Without.] [25]   Open the door; here's Henry safe and sound—I've rescued him. Hurrah!
Lord R. Perdition!—Henry safe! [To Hardolf.] You know the rest.
                                         [Exit Hardolf, R. D. Hos. [Opening the door.] You're welcome, gentlemen.
Edw. (L. D.) Here he is, safe and sound, though I had a hard struggle for it!

[Page 37]
Hen.
To friendship do I owe my life, and now,
Since danger is no more, let's think of love,
And send some tidings to the darling girls,
Who wait impatiently to hear from us. Edw. So do, Henry; write something quite tender and sentimental, d'ye hear? Yet, upon second thoughts, you may as well spare yourself the trouble, as we all march home to-morrow morning.
Lord R.
Not so: for, though the rebels are subdued,
It were not safe to quit the country yet—
Henry and you remain; and, since you both
Have prov'd yourselves most worthy of my confidence,
I leave you in command till further orders. Edw. You are very kind, my lord; but really we are not in the least ambitious: all we wish, with due submission, is to make haste home and get married.
Lord R.
Full time enough to run into the snares
Which woman lays for inconsiderate youth.                                          [Crosses, R., to Henry.
[50]   It grieves me sorely, Henry, to inform you,
That the poor bird your Jane gave you at parting,
Has, by a most untoward accident,
Been suffer'd to escape—yet write your letter,
And, as I journey homeward, I will be
Myself your messenger. Hen. (C.) My lord, you are most kind: what ho! good hostess.
Enter Hostess , L. Pens, ink, and paper here.
                                         [Exit Hostess, L., and re-enters, L., with pens, ink, and paper. Hos. Here, sir, is every thing you called for.
                                         [Exit, L. Lord R. Be brief, young man; for I depart to-night
                                         [Exit, R.. Edw. Well, Henry, I'll not interrupt you—our supper is ready; when you have done, you'll join us.
                                         [Exit, L. Hen. [Solus.]
Delay in love is death, by slow degrees!
Oh, what are rank and titles but a sound,
To him whose soul longs for more pure delights?
This cruel separation from my Jane
May prove most fatal to our happiness.
Lord Raymond goes to-night: does he mean well
He seems so friendly, that I dare not doubt him—
Now for a few fond words to her I love.
[Page 38]
[Sits down at the table, and writes—Hardolf slinks in behind him, R. D., with a dagger in his hand, and is about to stab him, when Lord Raymond, who follows, arrests his arm. Lord R. [Softly.]
Not yet. [Lord Raymond retires with Hardolf, R. D.—Henry finishes and folds up his letter—an alarm of drums and trumpets is heard without. Hen. [Starting up, and leaving his letter on the table.]
To arms again! What can this tumult mean?                                          [Rushes out, L. D. Enter Edwin and Yeomanry, R., who follow Henry in haste. Enter Lord Raymond , cautiously, R. D. Lord R. Whence this alarm? No matter, here's the letter—I'm curious to know what he has written. [Opens the letter and reads.] [75]   “ Dearest Jane—Kind heaven has hitherto protected me from every danger. We remain still some time here to watch the rebels, which grieves me, as I long to be with the dear object of my affections. As for the other Jane, whose picture I wear, though I pity, fidelity to thee forbids my loving her. Lord Raymond has kindly offered to be the bearer of these few lines from thy faithful —
“Henry.”
Lord R.
Short, but expressive; and the whole contents
As applicable to my sister, Lady Jane,
As to the Jane for whom they are intended—
And luckily the letter's not directed—
That task be mine— [Goes to the table, and writes the direction on the letter.] 'tis done—“To Lady Jane.”
The poisonous seeds of jealousy once sown
In the fair maiden's bosom, she is mine;
Her love was gold-proof, knowing Henry true—
But when she thinks him faithless, she will grasp
My offer with an eager hand—success! Re-enter Henry, Edwin , and Yeomanry, L. D. Hen.
'Twas but a false alarm. [Goes to the table to direct his letter, when Lord Raymond stops him. Lord R. [To Henry, L.]
Fearing you might not speedily return,
I have myself directed your love-letter,
And now depart. Good Henry, fare you well.                                          [Exit at L. D. Edw. (C.)
Come, Henry, your supper will be cold.
[Page 39]
Hen. (R.)
I want no supper, Edwin, for fatigue
Has quite subdued my spirits, and sleep invites me. Enter Hostess, L. S. E. Hos. Gentlemen, I am sorry to say my house is so [100]   full, that one of you will be obliged to sleep in yonder arm-chair, but I'll make it as comfortable for you as I can.
Edw. Very well; I'll sleep in the arm-chair with all my heart.
Hen.
Nay, go to bed; I wish to be alone:
My mind is melancholy, and the jesting
Of our jocose companions would ill suit
The sadness of my thoughts. Good night, dear Edwin. Edw.
Well, Henry, e'en as you please. Good night!                                          [Exit with Hostess lighting him, R. Hen.
I've often heard it said, that strange forebodings
Seize on the heart when danger is at hand:
Yet what have I to fear? This peaceful dwelling
Affords secure repose—whence, then, this tremor?
'Tis the effect of weariness—no more.
Come, sleep! thou sweet reviver of the spirits;
Into thy arms I sink: and, gracious heaven,
Bless thou this house, and all who dwell therein!
Dear Jane! had I thy picture, which the villains stole,
I now could press it to these longing lips!
Sweet love, good night.                                          [Sinks asleep on the chair. Enter Edwin and Ethelbert, softly, R. Eth. (R.) Since you have treated me with such humanity, I'll do all I can to serve you.
Edw. (L.) You suspect your comrade Hardolf of some foul design, you say?
Eth. [125]   I do; for even now I overheard him say, drawing a dagger, “He sleeps! now's the time!”—But soft, he comes this way! let's step aside and watch him.
                                         They retire. Enter Hardolf , R. D., with a drawn dagger—He first convinces himself that Henry is asleep—Henry, by moving his arm, throws down and extinguishes the lamp—stage dark. Har. Yonder he slumbers—that sleep shall be his last. This to his heart.
[Offers to stab Henry, but is prevented by Edwin and Ethelbert, who had closely followed him, unperceived—Hardolf drops the dagger.
[Page 40]
Edw. [Calling out.]
Murder! lights here!                                          [Henry starts up alarmed. Enter Hostess , followed by Eugene and Yeomanry, with lights. Hos.
Mercy on us! what is the matter? Edw.
Why, that villain attempted to murder Henry. Hen.
Detested wretch! what had I done to thee,
To prompt thee to so foul a deed? Har. Nothing particular: I was hired by Lord Raymond to do your business for you.—I don't care who knows it—if you doubt my word, yonder lies his lordship's dagger, and here's my reward. [Shows the purse with an insolent smile.] He's a good employer who finds both tools and wages.
Edw. [Binding his hands.]
Never fear, I'll take care of you. Eug.
And I'll take care of the dagger.                                          [Picks it up. Hen.
Nor shall the noble miscreant escape.
Retire to rest, my friends: to-morrow's dawn
Shall see us on our homeward march again:
And if in England justice be not dead,
This treachery shall cost Lord Raymond's head. [All form a picture, Hardolf struggling with Edwin and the Yeomanry, till the scene closes. SCENE V. —A Chamber in Lord Raymond's Castle. Enter Lady Jane , in black, R. D., followed by Old Francis . Fra. (R.) Prithee, now, good my lady, be comforted; and tell your old and faithful servant the cause of your grief. Why do you assume this mournful dress? It reminds me of a funeral. Alack! there is no rest, I fear, but in the grave, and I almost wish I was myself at the bottom of it.
Lady J. (L.)
Good Francis, that my heart is sorrowful
I'll not deny. The cause remains a secret—
You say the youth—I mean young Henry—
He did accept the picture which I sent him? Fra. Ay, marry did he, my lady; and it would have been most unpardonable insolence in him to have refused it. I hung it about his neck myself with these aged hands.
Lady J. And did he gaze upon it? Speak the truth.
Fra. No, my dear lady, he did not gaze upon it; and it vexed me sorely, after such an astonishing proof of your ladyship's great condescension, to see young Henry's
[Page 41]
eyes so firmly rivetted, not on your picture, but on Jane, old Walter's daughter. I thought it vastly mysterious, and tried all I could, but in vain—I could not get at the bottom of it.
Lady J. [Crosses to R.]
Enough! now hasten to the neighbouring convent,
And say that Lady Jane requests an audience
Of the good mother abbess. Fra. (L.) [25]   Why, my dear young lady, you surely do not mean to shut yourself up in a nunnery?
Lady J. Good Francis, go; and do as I command you.
Fra. I will, because I needs must, my lady: mercy on me! go into a nunnery in the very spring and blossom time of life! heaven forbid! Rather than ever live to see that day, I'd suffer myself to be thrown headlong into the castle ditch; though I'm sure, if I was, I should very soon get at the bottom of it.
                                         [Exit, L. Lady J.
Fond, foolish heart, be still! it is in vain!
Why, then, thus agitate this heaving bosom?
If 'tis a crime to love, I am a sinner,
In need of more than ordinary penance!                                          [Exit, R. D. SCENE VI. —Exterior of Walter's Cottage. Enter Jane, from the Cottage. Jane.
'Tis a most lovely morning; yet they say
An early sun shines rarely through the day.
I have had dreams to-night, which might alarm
A heart that had no confidence in heaven,
And loved not with unlimited affection.
Methought I wander'd o'er the field of battle,
And found my Henry welt'ring in his blood:
My screams awoke him from his death-like trance;
And, casting up his lovely eyes, he cried,
“Oh, Jane! beware Lord Raymond—he's a fiend,
Such as are none on earth, and few in hell!”
Then, pressing to his lips my trembling hand,
He breathed a pious parting prayer, and died. Rob. [Appearing at the cottage window.]
I see nothing of your favourite pigeon yet, sister. Jane.
The messenger of love not yet returned!
Spur thee, dull time, and doff thy leaden wings!
At love's call thou shouldst fly more swiftly far,
Than thou art wont to do at eventide,
[Page 42]

When loving youths and maidens, void of care,
Enjoy their sportive gambols on the green,
And chide the parting hour. Enter Lord Raymond , in haste, L. U. E. Lord R. (L.)
Where is Walter? Jane. (R.)
Within, my lord; and Henry— Lord R.
Is well, I hope.                                          [Looking up to heaven.
[25]   I wish to see your father. Jane.
I go, my lord.—What means this mystery?                                          [Exit into the cottage. Lord R. [Solus.] She must—she shall be mine! My rival, long ere this, has met his fate: he is no more!
Enter Walter from cottage—Jane remains anxiously listening at the cottage-door. Wal. (R.)
My lord, I joy to see you safe return'd—
What news? Lord R. (L.)
None of good import, Walter; it is true,
We have repulsed the rebels—yet poor Henry!                                          [Feigns grief—Jane is greatly alarmed. Wal.
What of him, my lord? Lord R.
Alas! he is no more.                                          [Pretends to weep. Jane. [Rushing frantic between them, and kneeling to Lord Raymond.]
Oh, gracious heaven! recall that horrid word,
For pity's sake! Plant daggers in my bosom,
And I will hold it as a deed of mercy;
But do not say, my lord, that Henry's dead! Wal. (R.)
Do, my dear lord, revoke the dreadful tidings!
For Henry was so good, so brave a youth—
We all adored him. Lord R. (L.)
Would it were possible! but truth is sacred!
He fell a victim to the foul revenge
Of an assassin—yet, my pretty Jane,
Trust me, he was unworthy of thy love,
For he did love another. Jane. (C.)
'Tis false! and though from heaven an angel came
To blast mine ear with such foul calumny,
I'd not believe him! Henry prove untrue!
[50]   As easy might the ewe become a wolf,
[Page 43]

And lacerate the tender lamb she bore,
Or mothers give their children gall for milk,
As Henry prove a traitor to his love!
My lord, I know him better.                                          [Crosses to L. Lord R. (C.) [Producing a letter and Jane's picture.]
Walter,
Peruse that letter; [To Jane.] and, if you still doubt,
Here is your picture, which he sends you back,
Declaring he preferred to wear my sister's. Jane. [Dreadfully agitated.]
Kind heaven, preserve my reason! Wal. [After reading the letter, hands it to Jane, who also peruses it.]
'Tis villanous! Lord R. [To Jane.]
Still doubtful, lovely Jane? Jane.
Henry dead, and faithless ere he died!
Impossible!                                          [Regarding the letter and picture.
Yet these are dreadful proofs.
He kept her picture! Lord R.
Since all obstructions are at length remov'd,
Now, Walter, let me urge my own pretensions;
I love your daughter, Jane, as well, you know—
Her hand will cancel every debt between us,
And make us friends for ever. Her refusal
I shall resent with a becoming spirit,
And let impartial justice take its course. Wal.
Come, my child, think no more of this Henry—
He has most shamefully deceiv'd us all,
[75]   For which he now must answer to high heaven.
Lord Raymond claims thee as his bride—consent. Lord R.
Ay, lovely Jane! speak, for it rests with you
To save your poor old father from a prison. Jane.
A prison, said you? 'Tis a cruel word!                                          [Kneeling to Lord Raymond.
It came not from your heart—that heart, my lord,
Which is so noble, just, and generous. Lord R.
Why parley thus? Wilt thou be mine or not? Wal.
Come, Jane, this obstinacy is absurd—
Decide, then, quickly; wilt thou wed Lord Raymond? Jane. [Heroically.]
Never! Lord R.
Unpardonable insult!                                          [Crosses to L. Wal. (R.)
Then I disown thee, stubborn, self-will'd girl!
I will to prison, and my latest breath
Shall call down curses on the unnatural child,
Who felt no pity for her poor old father
[Page 44]
Jane. [Between both, imploring, C.]
Father! for mercy's sake! My lord, in pity spare me! Wal.
Thou know'st my temper, Jane: wake not the lion
That slumbers in my bosom, or I may
Most grievously offend 'gainst heaven and thee.
No answer yet? Perdition seize thee, then,
Thou ingrate child! hence from my door for ever!
Go! wander as a beggar through the world,
A wretched outcast, friendless, and forlorn!
Bareheaded may the tempest overtake thee!
[100]   Barefooted mayst thou tread on naught but thorns!
A miserable monument of vengeance! Jane.
Father, in pity hear me! Wal.
Begone! and detestation follow thee!
I will to prison; and, while I languish there,
May conscience lash thee with her scorpion scourge,
From door to door to beg for mouldy bread—
Thy beauty blasted, and thy reason fled!                                          [Jane utters a piercing shriek, as if deprived of her reason. Lord R.
Come, lovely Jane, speak but the word; and say
Thou wilt be mine! Jane. [Piteously regarding her father, and smoothing down his gray locks with her hand.] Oh, yes, certainly—I will be your's, my lord: I could do any thing to save these venerable locks—Oh, yes—yes.
Lord R. [Exulting.] She's mine! success!
Jane. Did I say yes? Forgive me, heaven! [Staring at Lord Raymond for a moment, then turning from him with a shriek of horror.] No, never! never!
                                         [Tears the bridal flowers from her hair, and in a fit of frensy rushes off, L. U. E. Lord R. Perdition.
                                         [Exeunt, R.

END OF ACT II.
ACT III. SCENE I. —A Chamber in Lord Raymond's Castle. Enter Lord Raymond , R. D. Lord R.
Since threats avail not with the stubborn girl,
I'll try severer measures. What, ho! Francis!
[Page 45]
Enter Old Francis , R. D Fra. (R.)
I am here, my gracious lord. Lord R. (L.) Tell me the exact amount of Walter's debt.
Fra. Five hundred and five-and-twenty crowns, my lord; neither more nor less: and he declares he'll pay it honestly, which I firmly believe, as soon as prospects brighten with him a little. Alack-a-day! troubles will overtake the best of men sometimes—this is a fickle world: the wheel of fortune is always going round— sometimes we are at the top, and sometimes at the bottom of it.
Lord. R.
Psha! cease thy idle prate, and hear my orders:
I'll not have Walter longer for a tenant—
Go thou, distrain his goods, and turn him out. Fra. What, my lord! turn out a worthy tenant, who has honestly paid rent to your lordship's father and yourself for upwards of thirty years! Turn him out, indeed! now that misfortunes have overtaken him! You never can be so cruel, my lord! no, no!
Lord R.
Peace, graybeard! and obey me; for, by heavens!
I'll not be trifled with! My blood is boiling,
And I will have revenge! Go, turn the dotard out;
[25]   Send him adrift: ay, and his daughter, too!
E'en to the dogs with 'em, for aught I care. Fra. [After a short pause.] Do it yourself, my lord; I'll not be the instrument of such cruelty. No, not if you were to cast me into the deepest dungeon of your castle, and keep me there until I die, without a bit of straw at the bottom of it.
Lord R.
You dare dispute my orders!                                          [Seizing him.
Know'st thou not, hoary fool, this arm could crush thee? Fra. Yes; and a noble action it would be of you to strain your vigorous nerves to harm a poor old man, and offer insult to gray hairs. Oh, fie on't! shame! shame!
Lord R. Tutor me not, but go and do my bidding.
Fra. My lord, I will not stir an inch to do an act which conscience cannot justify; and I repeat, if honest Walter must be turned out of his cottage, do it yourself, my lord.
Lord R.
Send Rupert hither; he is not so squeamish. Fra. Nay, good my lord; I pray you be merciful:
[Page 46]
yet, if you still insist on the instant payment of honest Walter's debt, the money shall be forthcoming.
Lord R. Where should the pauper get so large a sum?
Fra. From a good friend, my lord; and I am that friend. During the forty years that I have had the honour to serve in this castle, I have laid me by some hundreds [50]   of good and lawful coin; ay, and it delights mine eyes to see the shining gold, because I know that poverty is grievous in old age; yet 'twill delight my heart much more to part with it, if I can save an honest man from sinking. I will pay Walter's debt—he shall not go to prison! Thanks to my frugality, I've got a good long purse, and to assist a friend in distress—I don't care how soon I get at the bottom of it.
Lord R.
What! wouldst thou throw away the staff of age?
Be lavish of thy substance unto those
Who would not even give thee in return
A crust of bread, if thou shouldst come to want it?
Go to! thou art again in leading-strings!                                          [Crosses to R.
I will bethink me how to treat this Walter. Fra. (L.) That's right, my lord, do so—consider better of it—reflection is to passion what water is to fire. [Aside in going.] Turn out an honest tenant into the wide world! Shame! shame! If ever I am guilty of so base an action, I wish I may go to a certain place when I die, and have a precious warm berth at the very bottom of it.
                                         [Exit, L D. Lord R.
I loathe the very name of man, and would
I were some savage beast, that I might glut
Myself with blood, not fearing an hereafter!
Psha! that's an idle phantasy! a dream!
Were the assassin, Hardolf, now but here,
[75]   He should set fire to old Walter's cottage;
And fortune, then, not I, might bear the blame
Of the fool's sufferings.—I'll do't myself!
'Tis shameful, whispers honour—what care I?
Revenge and passion prompt me to the deed—
I'll execute it, e'en though hearts should bleed.                                          [Exit, R. S. E. SCENE II. —Walter's Cottage. Enter Amy and Village Maidens, R. U. E. Amy. (R.) Oh, I'm so rejoiced! I've just heard that the wars are over, and the yeomanry on their march
[Page 47]
home again. Ah! yonder comes neighbour Buckram— now we shall hear the news.
Enter Buckram , L., splashed with dirt. Buc. (L.) Thanks to my invincible legs, here I am once more, after all my hardships, safe and sound, at home.
Amy. (R.) Welcome from the wars, neighbour; what news?
Buc. Bad enough, my dear: there has been terrible work. Never saw such cutting up and cabbaging in all my life before. Scarcely a remnant left of half the brave fellows who marched with me into the field of glory.
Amy. Mercy on me! I hope no harm has happened to my dear Edwin?
Buc. Oh, no; not much, my dear: he has only been run through the body with a pike nine feet long, just here, under the short ribs—such a button-hole!
Amy. [Nearly overcome.] Heavens! what, dead?
Buc. Can't say, indeed, my sweet little daffidown-dilly, whether the wound proved mortal or not, for I left head-quarters rather suddenly, having been sent off with despatches—I look like a courier, don't I? But as to your sweetheart, I don't think you stand the least chance of ever beholding him again; for, from the desperate [25]   nature of his wound, just under the short rib, I'd bet—

   A golden Henry to a base brass button,
   That Edwin, long ere this, is dead as mutton. Amy.
Oh, dear! oh, dear! I shall cry my eyes out!
I'm sure I shall. Buc. Nay, don't do that, my sweet little bit of velveteen; if one sweetheart is dead, you can easily get another, you know. What say you to me? I'm a devilish clever fellow—how do you like me?
Amy. Not at all, sir, I thank you. [Sobs.] And, if my dear Edwin is no more, I'm resolved to die a spinster.
                                         [Crosses to L. Buc. (R.) More fool you, I say; and, trust me, you'll repent your rash refusal of my generous offer, for, let me tell you, 'tis no small honour to get a handsome young man like me for a husband, and one who has been bravely fighting in the wars for his queen and country, and now returns covered with dust and glory. Hurrah! success to the brave! Now to deliver my despatches!
                                         [Exit, R.
[Page 48]
Amy. Edwin dead! Oh dear, oh dear! what will become of me?
                                         [Exit in tears, with Villagers. Enter Robinette from Walter's Cottage. Rob. Heigho! I am quite melancholy! Henry, they say, is dead—poor sister Jane gone nobody knows whither —and father is so cross, I'm almost afraid to speak to him. [Looking up.] What's that? Our little pigeon coming home from the wars; but he's brought no letter. [The bird falls at the child's feet.] [50]   Poor thing!—He's all over blood, too— [She takes up the pigeon] —but not quite dead. I'll nurse him—perhaps he may recover. [Looking off, L.] What man is that yonder in a long red cloak? He looks very sly. I'll step aside, and watch his motions.
                                         [Retires behind a tree, R. Enter Lord Raymond , L., in a long cloak, with a dark lantern and torch. Lord R.
Now for the deed, which shall completely place
The maiden in my power. Should I expel them
For a mere debt, the world would cry out shame
Upon my conduct; but, if they be burn'd out,
As 'twere by accident, she must submit
To my conditions, or be doom'd to wander
A beggar through the world. Now to my task.
'Tis lucky no one's near.                                          [Lights the torch by the lantern, and fires the cottage. Walter. [Within.]
Help! help!—Fire! Lord R.
The neighbours are alarmed—I must away.                                          [Exit, L., dropping his cloak. Enter Walter in despair, from the burning cottage. Wal. (L.)
Robinette, my child, where art thou? Rob. (R.) [Running from her hiding-place.]
I am here, father. [Walter embraces the child, kneeling—the neighbours run to his assistance from R. U. E.—they form an interesting picture, and the scene closes. SCENE III. —A Landscape. Enter Henry, Edwin , and Yeomanry, with the Rebels chained together, L. S. E. Hen. (L.)
Thus far kind heaven hath sped us on our way
To home, dear home, again, and those we love!
[Page 49]
Eth. (C.) You may rejoice, young man; for love awaits you, while we have nothing to expect but death.
Edw. (R.) Poor fellows!—Who knows but her majesty may take pity on you, considering you were brought into this trouble by the cruel tyranny of Lord Raymond?
Enter Eugene with a paper, L. S. E. Eug. Success!—Good news! good news!
Edw. What's it all about, eh? Are all the young men and virgins going to get married?
Eug. Not exactly that; but an officer has just joined the army, with her majesty Queen Elizabeth's most gracious pardon to the prisoners, and an order instantly to release them; those only excepted who have wantonly shed innocent blood.
Omnes.
Hurrah!—Long live the queen! Hen.
It joys my heart to raise a suffering brother
To hope and happiness; and proud am I
To be the instrument of giving you
Both life and liberty.                                          [Directs Eugene to unbind the Rebels. Edw. [Pointing to Hardolf.] All but one, Henry, if you please.
Har. And why not me, too? Have I shed innocent blood?
Edw. [25]   But you would, though, if I hadn't prevented you; recollect that, if you please.
Hen. Yet I forgive him.
Eug. Pray, is not that fellow's name Hardolf?
Har. That is one of my names, sure enough.
Eug. [Looking over the paper.] Then his name is expressly included in the list of exceptions.
Har. No matter—damned if I care! Many's the brave fellow has been hanged before now.
Hen. [Crosses to R.]
Now, brother soldiers all, without delay,
Sweet home be our watchword!—March away!                                          [Exeunt, R. S. E. SCENE IV. —A wild rocky Glen, overgrown with thorns and briars—a rude hut, L.—a tree, with a seat or bank of flowers under it. Enter Jane , wildly, her hair in disorder, R. U. E. Jane.
Follow me not, my lord!—In pity spare me!
Bid me to plunge into the raging ocean,
[Page 50]

Nurse serpents in my bosom, sport with tigers,
Or drink in copious draughts the rankest poison,
And I'll obey; but ask me not again
To be your wife— [Shuddering.] —No!—That were hell on earth!                                          [Looking wildly around.
I am safe now—he will not find me here!
Distracted—houseless—fatherless—forlorn!
Here in this dreary wilderness I'll dwell;
These rugged rocks—these naked thorns and briars,
Are emblems of my fate!—This is my home!                                          [Takes the dove out of her bosom, and reclines on the ground.
Sweet innocent companion of my woes!
My fellow-mourner!—We are both lovelorn
Thy mate's untrue to thee, as mine to me.
Perchance he, too, is dead; but, my sweet bird,
Mourn not, for I will keep thee in my bosom.
Yet what would that avail thee? This poor heart
Is now as cold and comfortless as ice!
Ah, me!—We are both poor and destitute!
Heaven pity us!                                          [Kisses the dove, replaces it in her bosom, and rises wildly.
      Henry faithless!—Henry dead!
      Beauty blighted!—Reason fled!
      Wonder not poor Jane ran wild,
      When her father curs'd his child,                                          [Shuddering.
[25]         And her lover prov'd untrue!
      Have you ever lov'd? Or you?
      Have you felt the joy and gladness
         When at eve your love return'd?
      Have you felt the cruel sadness,
         When affection he has spurn'd?
      Maidens, wonder not to find
      Base deception in mankind.
      Lovers seem sincere and tender
         During courtship, sighing, praying;
      But, when you your hearts surrender,
         Then they glory in betraying,
      And you look for love in vain,
      As was the lot of Crazy Jane! AIR— Crazy Jane .

   “Fondly my young heart receiv'd him,
      Which was form'd to love but one;
   He vow'd—he swore, and I believ'd him:
      He was false, and I undone!

   “From that hour has reason never
      Held her empire o'er my brain;

[Page 51]
SCENE V. —A Chamber in Lord Raymond's Castle. Enter Lady Jane , R. D., alarmed; she goes to the window, through which the conflagration of Walter's Cottage is visible. Lady J.
Poor Walter's cottage burn'd! I do suspect
Some vile incendiary. His daughter, too,
The lovely Jane, distracted!
Good heavens! that misery should overtake
The virtuous in this world, while villany
Escapes the rod, and laughs at innocence!
Francis, come hither. Enter Francis , L. D. Fra. (L.)
Did you call, my lady? Lady J. (R). I did, good Francis. Take this purse of gold, and hasten with it to relieve poor Walter.
Fra. Ay, marry will I, my lady, in a moment; and do you only look out at the window, if you please, and see how nimbly I will run across the lawn. I am an old man, 'tis true; yet, in a good cause, I can run as fast as a grayhound. But I'm glad you've given over all thoughts of the nunnery.
Lady J. Lose not a moment, Francis, but begone.
Fra. Ay, that I will, my lady. I'll run—I'll fly—I'll —But you'll not forget to look out at the window, and see me run along. I've got a tremendous long flight of steps to go down before I reach the lawn; yet, in a good cause, I shall very soon be at the bottom of it.
                                         [Exit, running, L. D. Enter Lord Raymond , in breathless haste, R. D. Lord R.
The deed is done, and no one knows of it! Lady J. [Overhearing him, and coming forward, L.]
If you've done evil, brother, rest assur'd
[25]   That there is One, whose penetrating eye
Pierces the inmost secrets of the soul,
And sees where all besides himself are blind. Lord R.
Sister, I'll not be school'd. Hence to thy chamber!                                          [Crosses to L. Lady J. (R.)
Yet say, what hast thou done, my dearest brother? Lord R. (L.)
A deed which hell devis'd, yet heaven look'd on,
And saw me execute; therefore, a deed of fate. Lady J.
May heaven pardon thee, whate'er it be!
[Page 52]

I have observ'd of late thy alter'd temper:
You were once mild, affectionate, and kind;
Now your eye rolls with passion's angry fire,
Filling your sister's soul with anguish. Say,
What troubles you, my brother? Speak, I pray. Lord R. [Affectionately taking her hand.]
Thou art a good girl, Jane; thy brother feels
Thy worth, and yet he never can disclose,
Not e'en to thee, the secret griefs that wring
His tortur'd breast, and goad him on to madness.
Men of strong passions are the toys of fate,—
The tools of hell! That I am what I am,
Lies in my blood; else why do flames rage here?
While other virtuous souls are cold as ice,
Why doth this eye speak such terrific language?
This aching heart teem with infernal thoughts?
Did I create myself? No—no!—'Tis fate!
Laugh, demons, if ye will! I, too, can laugh
[50]   At poor impotent man—Ha! ha! ha! ha!
Vice is a giant—Virtue a poor dwarf!
Else would she crush her daring adversary;
Not let him range, to damn, without control,
That precious jewel, man's immortal soul!                                          [Crosses to R. Enter Old Francis , L. D. Fra. [To Lady Jane.] My lady, I am sorry to say I cannot find old Walter anywhere: his cottage has been burned to the ground, and he has wandered thence distracted.
Lady J. (C.)
Go, try again—make due inquiry;
Give him the money to relieve his wants. Lord R.
Give Walter money!—Give him poison rather! [Aside.]
Have I for this done such a ruthless deed,
To place him in my power? Give me the purse. Fra. [Quickly hiding it.] I'll fetch it, my lord. [Aside.] If I do, I wish I may tumble from the top of the staircase to the bottom of it!
                                         [Exit, L. D. Lord R. To be thus thwarted! Oh, malicious fate!
Lady J. His look appals me. Heaven have mercy on him!
                                         [Exit, R. S. E. Re-enter Old Francis in haste, L. D. Fra. My lord, the people are all in an uproar; they cry, “Death to Lord Raymond!” Young Henry is returned from the wars, and leads the noisy crew.

[Page 53]
Lord R. 'Tis false, thou drivelling liar! Henry's dead!
                                         [Loud shouts without. Fra. There, I told you so!—Now you'll very soon get [75]   at the bottom of it.
                                         [Exit. Lord R.
Henry alive! Then all is lost for ever!
Yet, why despair? Come forth, my sword! I'll meet
Barefac'd rebellion with determin'd front,—
Outdare the bully, and e'en death defy!
For undisturb'd I'll live, or bravely die!                                          [Exit, L. S. E. SCENE VI. —Wild Rocky Glen, as before.—Violent Storm, with Thunder and Lightning. Enter Walter , R. U. E. led by little Robinette , with Lord Raymond's red cloak on her arm. Wal. (R.)
This tempest is an emblem of my fate.
Here let us rest, my child; my feeble limbs
Will carry me no further. Rob. (L.) I wish the neighbours had been a little quicker: then they might have seized the villain who set fire to our cottage.
Wal.
Ruin'd, and by a vile incendiary!
Remorseless wretch! I never injur'd thee!
I injur'd no man. Art thou sure, my child?
Didst mark the villain well? Rob. I did not see his face; but, in making his escape, he dropped this cloak, so that I hope he'll be discovered, and brought to justice. However, my dear father, the cloak will serve to shield you from the fury of the tempest.
Wal. We'll share it, love; else thou wilt be exposed to the contending elements.
Rob. Oh, I don't mind, so long as my poor old father doesn't suffer.
Wal. Thou art a dear good child; yet, who can tell? When you grow older, you, too, may prove ungrateful.
Rob. Never, with heaven's blessing! But you are faint and weary. Come, father, sit you down awhile. [Crosses to R.] I see a hut yonder—I'll knock and ask for [25]   some refreshment for you. Who knows, perhaps its inhabitants may be charitable.
                                         [Walter sits down on a bank, L. Wal.
A draught of water's all I crave, my child.                                          [Exit Robinette into a hut, R. Wal.
I've read in history of old King Lear;

His two ungrateful daughters drove him mad.
Was it a wonder? I am nearly so,
That have but one. Thus to refuse Lord Raymond,
When her consent had sav'd her poor old father!
Oh, most unnatural child! Oh, cruel Jane!                                          [Sinks exhausted. Enter Robinette from the hut, leading her sister Jane . Jane. (R.)
Water, my dear, for a poor weak old man?
What use is water? I will give him wine.
I love old men; for I've an aged father,
Whose heart is good, though he did curse his child. Rob. (L.) Why, Jane, my dear sister! don't you know me? What makes you live in this wild desolate place? Have you forgotten your poor old father Walter, Henry, Robinette, and all of us?
Jane. [After a pause.]
Walter!—Henry!—Robinette! Those names
Were dearer once to this poor broken heart,
Than all the treasures of the golden east.
But Henry's dead!—and, were he still alive,
He'd be a lady's lord, not poor Jane's Henry!
Ah, me! we live in a vile wicked world!
Heaven mend it! There's no peace but in the grave!
Ay, there I'll rest amongst grim skeletons:
[50]   They'll not deceive me with an outward show
Of loveliness, while all is foul within.
No!—They are hideous to the sight, but honest!
   Seek not rest on a downy bed;
   Seek it where the silent dead
      Rest their heads on mother earth:
   And, believe me when I say,
   Happier is our dying day
      Than the morn that gave us birth!                                          [With a deep heart-rending sigh.
Kind Heaven have mercy on us all! Amen! Rob.
Do, Jane, for pity's sake, help your poor father! Jane.
Help!—Pity!—They are words devoid of sense.
Call on the howling tempest for compassion,—
Crave pity from the tiger of the desert,
But ask it not of man, unless he's mad.
Yet I am mad, and therefore I can pity.
Where is the poor old man? He shall have wine;
Yes, wine—wine—wine! [She goes to a rocky spring, R., draws some water in a shell, and gives it to Robinette.
[Page 55]
Rob.
Why, sister, this is water. Jane.
'Tis nature's wine; pure, unadulterated!
There's no deception in't—I hate deception;
It has driven me mad! where is the poor old man? Rob.
Yonder he sits, beneath that tree. Jane. [Goes to Walter.]
Here, sir, is some of nature's wine for you;
It will revive your spirits. [Walter looks up, and is about to drink, when, recognising Jane, he dashes the shell to the ground. Wal. (L.)
[75]   Viper, begone!
Rather than wet these lips with aught
Thy hand hath touch'd, I'd die of burning thirst!
Hence, most ungrateful child! and may the fiends— [Jane, with a dawning of reason, recognises her father, utters a loud scream, and drops on her knees. Jane. (R.)
Oh, curse me not again! I cannot bear it!
My brain is quite distracted—one more curse
Will make it burst asunder! Oh, my father!                                          [Gradually approaching him on her knees.
In mercy pity me! pity thy wretched Jane,
And curse her not!
She is thine own, thy poor distracted child!
Ah, now I see a tear—and now a smile,
In that beloved, venerable face!
Your heart relents—joy! joy! poor Jane is happy!                                          [Swoons at her father's feet. Wal.
My child! my poor lost child! come to my heart!
Revive—look up, my love!                                          [Military march in the distance. Enter Edwin and Yeomanry, R. U. E., and remain in the background. Jane. [Revives, but relapses into partial delirium.]
Hark!
   Heard I not that warlike measure,
      When false-hearted Henry left me,
   And of every joy bereft me,
      When I lost my dearest treasure? Edw. [Coming forward, L.] Who says Henry's false-hearted? What do I behold! Poor Jane, distracted! What can this mean? Poor girl, how wildly she looks! Don't you know me, Jane? I say Henry's true!
Jane. (C.)
He was true once; but now—here are my proofs.                                          [Producing the picture and letter.]
[100]   He kept her picture, and return'd me mine—
Heaven pardon him!
[Page 56]
Edw. I say he was robbed of it; and Lord Raymond took it from the robber again.
Wal. (R.) Good heavens! what villany!
Edw. And as to this letter, [Opens it] it certainly was Henry who wrote it; but, as I live, it is directed to Lady Jane instead of you; and in Lord Raymond's own hand-writing, too—oh, the villain!
[Tumult without, with cries of “Death to Lord Raymond! down with him! Enter Lord Raymond , L. U. E., followed by a disorderly Crowd, armed with clubs, &c. Lord R. (C.)
Tumultuous rabble! get you to your homes!
Or dread my vengeance! Edw. Your vengeance! [Snapping his finger at him.] We don't care that for your vengeance!
Enter Eugene , R. U. E. Eug. (L.) No! for here is an order from her majesty to arrest your person.
Lord R. Conspiracy! Of what am I accused?
Eug. Of having hired the assassin, Hardolf, to murder young Henry Harford.
Jane. [Aside to her father.]
Oh, horrid deed! Wal. [Aside to Jane.]
Be comforted, my child! Lord R.
'Tis false!
The villain lies, to say I hired him! Eug. Our proof is this dagger, which you yourself gave the assassin: see, it is your own.
Lord R. [Seizing the dagger.] Perdition!
Enter Lady Jane , followed by Francis , L. S. E. Lady J. (L. C.) [125]   What dreadful tidings! Spare! oh spare, his life!
Fra. (L.) Heyday! why, what is this? His lordship's very best cloak lying on the ground—how came it here, I wonder? I know it well, by this mark at the bottom of it.
Rob. Lord Raymond's cloak! then he's the man who set fire to our cottage!
Eug.
What! an incendiary, too! seize the monster! Lord R.
Stand back! he is a corpse who dares approach me!
What, die a felon on a public scaffold!
[Page 57]

No, never! and, since fate will have it so,
Thus will I shun disgrace, and die a Raymond!                                          [Stabs himself—all gather round him.
'Twas a home thrust! I feel life ebbing fast;
And, ere I die, let me make some atonement.—                                          [To Lady Jane.
Give alms of all my substance to the poor—
I feel it is no easy thing to die, when conscience
Is in arms.—Oh, what a dreadful pang!
Jane, injur'd maid, come hither! fear me not!
I cannot harm thee now. Thy Henry
Was a most loyal lover—Walter, too!
Oh, speak forgiveness! that kind word will prove
Sweet music to my soul—refuse me not! Wal.
My lord, seek heaven's peace; I do forgive you Jane.
And I, too, from the bottom of my soul. Hen. [Without.]
[150]   What horrid tale is this? My Jane distracted!
Where is she? Let me fly into her arms! Enter Henry , R. U. E. Hen.
My Jane! Jane.
My Henry!                                          [They embrace. Lord R.
Henry! thy pardon, too, before I die!                                          [Delirious.
Hell drags me down! Avaunt, accursed fiends!
Ye shall not have my soul! See, where they come,
In legions, to rack these writhing limbs!
Oh, mercy! mercy!                                          [Dies.—The curtain slowly descends to a soft adagio. DISPOSITION OF THE CHARACTERS AT THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. Villagers . Yeomanry . Villagers .

PROLOGUE, BY R. BARLOW, ESQ. [By Barlow, R.]
In these blest days, the horrid din of arms
No longer wakes us with its dread alarms;—
Our warriors seek no more the field or flood,
And men have leisure to be wise and good.
Yet we, alas! have scarcely dried the tear,
Which flow'd to consecrate a monarch's bier;—
Who, for those laurels watch'd through years of gloom,
Which only rose to decorate his tomb.—
Whate'er the factions of our giddy throng,
Whatever ills from public woes have sprung;
The veriest wretch that owns a Briton's name,
Had prov'd his shield—the bulwark of his fame.
—No more!—forgive the bard these mournful strains,
Our “ Hebrew ” of to-night attention claims:—
No longer scoff'd, in peaceful compact blend
Christian and Jew , by turns each other's friend.
—The days of yore are past,—the advent'rous times,
When men were great in virtues as in crimes;
—Such days have left us, yet one master hand,
Hath borne the spell,—they rise at his command;
Triumphant genius bids the past appear,
To wake our terrors or command the tear;—
Unlike the bards of old who hapless pin'd
In want and solitude, your voice combin'd,
Pours the rich bounty of your just applause,
—The Novelist's , your own, and virtue's cause.
—'Tis at this shrine our bard to-night hath lit
His torch obscure—yet he, alas! unfit,
The scenes of “Ivanhoe” to copy here,
Hath sought for safety in a humbler sphere.
If from compiler's dull mechanic ways,
He fearless turns, will you withhold your praise?
Ah, no! who boldly dares will ever find,
A British audience, even in censure, kind;—
If not presumptuous, yet with hope impress'd,
Say will you crush this nursling of his breast?
Think how unlike all other's is the cause
Of our dramatic bards,—no courts—no laws—
No hope—no suffrage, but in your applause ;—
Since then your favour's sought, your censure fear'd,
Be just,—be generous,—judge not till you've heard.

[Page 8]

EPILOGUE, BY J. R. PLANCHE, ESQ. [By Plache, J.R.]
May I come in? your pleasure, let me know it;
I'm sent to sound a parley by the Poet.
When for that service first he fix'd to choose me,
I answered, with a curtsey, “Sir, excuse me.”
Why what dost fear, he cried, thou silly goose,
Dost think they'll fire upon a flag of truce ?
Go, trumpet-tongued, this peaceful message bear
To the besiegers in the outworks there;
Tell them our garrison can't stand their shot ,
If they intend to fire it hissing hot ;
Vain all defence, the fort must fall for certain,
Adieu to horn-work, covered way , and curtain ;
They, therefore, e'er they're all made “food for worms,”
Surrender upon honorable terms.
Away, he added, be an humble pleader,
Or they'll attack our band , and kill the leader .
His fears thus hastily the author told me,
Then ope'd the sally-port , and here behold me.
What force you're in, one charge , and you must rout us;
What batteries on all the heights about us.
Critics, your heavy troops ; and Beaux, your light ones ,
Have you got serjeants ?—O yes, plenty, white ones .
Of conquest sure, their very looks are killing ,
And all hearts must confess their skill at drilling .
First, then, I'll ask the officers' compassion;
Next rank and file , I should say, rank and fashion ,
Let me crave your's; express your satisfaction,
You half-price corps, who last came into action.
And you of the artillery brigade ,
Whose greatest glory is a cannonade .
The word has been attention , grant our prayer,
And let to-morrow's word be— as you were .
Let not our hope be a forlorn one made,
But as a feu-de-joi , each fire a hand grenade:
So shall our Hebrew glad his wandering nation,
And gain “the promised land”— your approbation .

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. —Cedric's Hall: Cedric and the Palmer. Cedric.
Tell me not, Palmer; I must curse these Normans;
'Tis all I can; we bear the name and form
Of Saxons, not the heart—else—to your tale;
You spoke of good King Richard—Though a Norman,
He loves his Saxons—to thy story—Oh!
That noble Richard! While he pines in chains
Of Austria's forging, here his brother, John,
Ambitious of his throne, makes factious part
With Templars, tatter'd soldiers, and a crew
Of honorable beggars, such as live
Conjecture says not how—But to your tale. Palmer.
My story is of Ivanhoe— Cedric (interrupting him).
                                         My son!
A father's curse,— Palmer.
                     Curse not thy son. Cedric.
                                         I do. Palmer.
Curse not thy son, old man;—he loves thee well. Cedric.
It has not seem'd so; I will tell thee, Palmer;
Thou art a Saxon, and wilt understand me.
He lov'd a Jewess—that was sin enough;
He did deny to leave her at my bidding;
That was a sin a father could not pardon;
I banish'd him my house, my blood, the land. Palmer.
My life the pledge,
[25]   Her soul is spotless as the vestal beam
[Page 10]

That falls in summer midnights from the moon
Upon the brooks of earth. Horn without: Oswald enters. Oswald.
My Lord, the Prior Aymer, and the Knight
Brian de Bois Guilbert, request, for them
And for their train, your shelter. Cedric.
                                         Normans both! Palmer.
But yet thy door should not be bolted 'gainst them;
For hospitality is as the sun,
That shines on all, on weeds as on the flow'rs,
Or else on nothing shines. Cedric.
                                         You chide me well.
Go, bring them in. Oswald goes out, and re-enters, conducting the Prior Aymer, Brian, and their train. Cedric.
                                         To hearth and table welcome. Prior.
Right noble Cedric, we do thank thee well. All seat themselves at the great table, except the Palmer, who places himself in a corner by the fire.
Our way was to the tourney, which the Prince
To morrow holds at Ashby, but the night
Clos'd in upon us. Our noble host, you join
The tournament? Cedric.
                                         Such is my purpose, father. Brian.
'Twill be a day for after times to talk of;
The valours of our island will be there,
No carpet warriors,—men,—whose hands and hearts
Are temper'd as their swords—'Twill be a day
Of blows, and blood, and death. Oswald enters. Oswald.
[50]                                            The wealthy Jew,
Isaac of York, craves shelter. Cedric.
                                         Bring him in. Brian.
A Jew sit with a Templar! Prior.
                                         Or with me,
A Father of the Church?
[Page 11]
Palmer.
                                         And hath he then
No feeling of the tempest? Will the rains
Spare him, that drench the Christian? Or these winds,—
Will they pass over him as o'er the oak
That bends, yet feels them not. Prior.
                                         Noble host,
'Tis he, whose daughter did bewitch your son. Palmer.
His love is not their crime—their mis'ry rather.
I pity the old man. Brian.
                                         By Paul! He comes!
How the dog crouches! Oh! he'd play the part
Of kind humility. But dæmon Pride
Burns in that dark wild eye, and mocks the show
His habit would put on. Enter Isaac. Isaac.
                                         Your pardon, pray:
The storm is cold and wet, and growing night
Made the few miles that lie 'twixt me and home
A weary way—I mean my brother's home;
For there I would abide to-morrow's tourney,
[75]   Which being done, I shall return to York,
To mine own dwelling. Ced.
Well; be seated, Jew. Prior.
Not here. Brian.
                                         Nor here. Isaac.
O ye, twelve tribes! What evil is in me,
Poor way-worn man, that I'm cast forth of all
As dead flesh from the living bone? Palmer.
                                         Old man,
My vest is dry; my hunger full; thou art
Both wet and fasting. Sit. Isaac.
                                         And is it so?
I did not think to weep—O, noble youth,
I thank thee with my tears. Brian.
                                         A pilgrim thou!
Shame of thy habit—Dost touch hands with Jews?
[Page 12]
Isaac.
Thou hast done worse, for thou hast touch'd the earth
In combat with young Ivanhoe.—So fame
Reports from Palestine. Palmer.
                     And truly. Brian.
                                         Slave! Cedric.
Blood must not stain my hospitable board.                                          Brian speaks aside to his Saracens. Prior.
Let the Jew go; his presence is a stone
To whet the knife of discord. Cedric.
                                         Say not so. Isaac.
[100]   Kind Saxon, yes; 'tis fitting I should go;
Better the old man die, if death indeed
Be in the storm, than so much blood of youth
Should flow in riot. Palmer.
                                         Templar, I have mark'd thee;
The Jew goes not alone. Brian (contemptuously.)
And who art thou? Palmer.
I am—the Palmer; one who, in the lack
Of thy philosophy, thinks man is man,
Whate'er his faith, his habit, or his speech.
Come, Jew, I'll be thy safety. Isaac.
                                         Noble youth!
How shall I thank thee? Hate, and scorn, and blows,
Are our sad portion—thou—men say I love
My gold too well—it may be so; I'm old,
And age will freeze the heart as winter locks
The bounty of the brook: yet shine the sun,
Twill melt the ice; thy kindness is a sun—
I feel it at my heart. Brian.
                                         Base renegade! Prior.
Vile infidel! Brian.
                     Forth! Forth! Isaac.
                                         I pity thee;
The poor old Jew—the dog—worse if worse be,
Whom thy scorn spits upon, thy hatred loathes,
[125]   Doth pity thee! think, Christian, what thou art,
When one so poor, so beaten, so forlorn,
Can say, I pity thee. Brian.
                     Die, villain!
[Page 13]
Cedric.
                                         Hold! Cedric keeps back Brian, who had drawn upon Isaac. Isaac.
Oh, valour nobly shown, and wise as noble!
For is it not a valour most discreet,
That knows to safely choose its foe, and makes
Its secure war on hands that lack the sword,
Or swords that lack the hand? Brian.
                                         Unloose me, sirs. Isaac.
Hark how the lion roars! Palmer.
                                         No more, old man. Prior.
Go forth, I say. Isaac.
                                         But this, and I am gone. Prior.
Be wise, and fear. Isaac.
                                         What should I fear? I've broke
The bread of Cedric;—drank his wine—I'm safe
In hospitality. Cedric.
                                         'Tis true;—He stays. Brian.
Thou money-bag—thou thing, whose Midas-touch
Turns all to gold,— Isaac.
                                         And what art thou?—A cypher,—
That swells the social number though itself
Is merely nothing.—What seed hast thou sown?
[150]   What harvest reap'd?—What things of profit made?
What merchandize exchang'd?—Thou hast set up
A false god, Honour, at whose shrine man's blood
Is pour'd in sacrifice by night and day;
Thy worship is a murder;—and thy life
Is nothing but that worship. Cedric.
                                         Jew, no more. Isaac.
I was too rash—Say 'twas the fault of age,
And pardon it; the dryest wood is still
The quickest to the spark. Cedric.
                                         No more of strife.
Oswald, conduct the Jew to his repose. Isaac.
O noble Cedric! you have waken'd here
A feeling that I thought was not; so long,
So dully it had slumber'd.—Well, I see
Impatience kindles in your eye—Good night!
Thou'lt not sleep harder that an old man's pray'r
[Page 14]

Invokes a blessing on thee—and my heart,
My very soul, breathes forth an orison
For thy felicity. Blest be thy night,
And oh, thy day more blessed. Fare thee well.                                          (Exit Isaac. Prior.
Let us to bed; the night is growing old,
And we must forth with early morn to Ashby,
To Prince John's tournament.                                          (Aside to Brian.
Brian, be calm. Brian. (to him)
[175]   Yes; for I mind me of an after game—
I'll pull the bravest feather from the wing
Of this same infidel. Prior.
                                         The parting cup,
And then to rest, good host. Cedric.
                                         Be't as you say. Prior.
The toast be mine—the fairest of the fair!
Although a Jewess, to her health—Rebecca— All.
Rebecca! Prior.
                     Now, good night. Cedric.
                                         Lights, knaves—Myself
Will be your servant. All go out except the Palmer—Gurth enters. Palmer.
How to save the Jew!
For sav'd he must be at what ever price—
Ha! honest Gurth—
The Jew and I must forth.
Undo the postern gate. Gurth.
                                         Ay, marry! when—
At your good bidding? Palmer.
                                         Ay, at mine. The Palmer draws back his cowl. Gurth.
How! Palmer.
Silence; walls have ears. Gurth.
                                         But yet no tongues
To tell what they do hear. Palmer.
                                         Where sleeps the Jew? Gurth.
[200]   In the north tower. Palmer.
                     And I?
[Page 15]
Gurth.
                                         I' the room below. Palmer.
I know it well—the light—when all's still, come. Gurth and the Palmer go out on different sides. SCENE II. —A Gallery in Cedric's Castle: Cedric and Servants enter conducting the Prior, Brian, Saracens, &c. Cedric.
This way, my noble guests. Prior.
                                         We entertain
Your kindness as 'tis offer'd, frankly, freely. Brian. A moment, with your leave—Melek—a trifle 'tis, yet proper to the moment.
Cedric.
                                         Take your time. Brian. (aside to Melek)
There is a pilgrim in the Prior's train; Melek.
Francis, my Lord.                                          (Wamba steals in.) Brian.
                                         Get me his pilgrim's garb,
And bring it to my chamber. (Exit, Melek.) Our kind host!— All go out except Wamba, who comes to the front. Wamba.
What should he want now with a pilgrim's frock?
Some notable intrigue! your soldier, troth,
Is ever nibbling at the wenches, as
Your mouse at cheese, or fishes at the hook,
When as the wind blows southerly. Good faith,
Here is strange fellowship; Jew, Norman, Saxon;
Here's Noah's ark; your Saxon is a horse;
An ass the Jew, who bears his load for others;
A wolf, your Norman—Well an if a man
Should choose to prophecy, horse, ass, and wolf,
Will be by th' ears ere morning. Gurth. (stealing in)
                                         Wamba!—Fool! Wamba.
That's I; yet now I think on it again,
It is not I, for he 's a wise man who
[25]   Doth know himself; and if I know myself,
Why then, no fool. Gurth.
                     There's mischief stirring.
[Page 16]
Wamba.
                                         True;
You're not abed. Gurth.
                                         Truce with thy mocks, good fool:
Are all at rest? Wamba.
                                         At rest?—I'll not say that;
But all are in their beds:—O, Gurth! Gurth! Gurth!
Your taper burning in the chimney nook
Shall see more merry sights, than e'er the sun
Can hope to look upon. Gurth.
                     Hark! Wamba.
                     Wherefore? Gurth.
                                         Hush! Wamba. Your pitcher, I; two goodly ears and a wide mouth, but no tongue.
Gurth. (striking him) Wilt not be silent?
Wamba. What's that for?
Gurth. For thee.
Wamba. Thank ye; but, good troth, you're welcome to it again, an you'll take it at my hands.
Gurth. No anger, fool.
Wamba. Fool, quotha! Better be a fool in word, [50]   —as I am,—than a fool in deeds,—as thou art. I never get drunk with ale,—as thou dost,—and that is folly, for it makes the head ache: I am not married, —as thou art,—and that is folly, for it makes the heart ache—nay, and the head too beyond the cure of physic—no getting rid of the horn of cuckoldom; it grows, like your corn, the more you cut it.
Gurth. Go to; my wife is faithful to me.
Wamba. Neither am I valiant; for valour is quarrelsome: quarrels bring blows, blows bring pain; and he who is a voluntary to pain, shall have any praise under Heaven but that of wisdom. Now I think on't, I will tell thee a tale which thou shalt like marvellously, for thou shalt not understand its least syllable.
Cedric. (without) Wamba!
Wamba. Nuncle cuts short my tale.

[Page 17]
Gurth. Thou'lt be the more like a man:—but, Wamba, when Cedric is at rest, let me know—here— or in my chamber.
Wamba. Some petticoat business. Knave thou hast been, knave thou art—may, can, will, and shall be, through all moods and tenses—past, present, and to come. An thou art not damned; the devil must be horn-mad.
Wamba and Gurth go out on different sides. SCENE III. —A rude Bed-chamber. The Jew asleep on a Pallet. Brian enters in a Palmer's habit. Brian.
The dull brute sleeps. Now, could I make him fear
An instant danger, and so lead him forth
To mine own castle, I'd wring heaps of gold
From his close avarice. This guise will hide
My real seeming. What should he with gold,
But as the mule to bear't for others' use?
Mule, I will ease thee of thy burthen. Isaac. (asleep)
                                         Mercy! Brian.
His slumber speaks: Now for my holy part,
A part I scarce shall prosper in—Awake! Isaac.
Murd'rer! Hold back thy hand! A hundred marks—
A thousand—for my life, my precious life. Brian.
Nay, know me better; am I not your friend? Isaac.
Thou art a Christian;—yet have mercy on me! Brian.
I am thy friend, and come with friendly purpose.
The Templar's avarice would wring the gold
From thy hard gripe. Isaac.
                     And thou will save me? Brian.
                                         Yes. Isaac.
O noble youth! a hapless race are we!
And thou wilt guide me forth. The mountain top
[Page 18]

Is not more open to the winds of Heaven
Than we to persecution. Gen'rous youth!
Wrong is not wrong when it is done to us;—
[25]   We're held a game for service of the rich,
Who fence us from the gripe of meaner hands
To hunt us down themselves. Brian.
                                         Well; follow me;
I'll be thy safety from the Templar. Isaac.
                                         Who
Will safe me from thyself? Brian.
                                         Stay in thy doubt,
And perish. Isaac.
                                         Hold! I do not doubt—And yet—
Such was the figure, such the voice of him
My dream show'd to me. Brian.
                     How! a dream!— Isaac.
                                         E'en so.
Laugh if you will—But has not heav'n ere now
Through the thin shade of dreams discours'd to man,
Divulging murder when hid fathoms deep?
Are not the dreams of sleep like shadows seen
In doubtful moonlight? Brian.
                     Tush. Isaac.
                                         But hearken, youth,
I follow'd you through night, when, on the sudden,
A dreadful earthquake shook our lower world;
The bosom of the earth was torn; the graves
Yawn'd wide with cold and famish'd maw,
[50]   As if, too leanly fed by death, their hunger gap'd
For living food to gorge their appetite. Brian.
Would'st teach me, like thyself, to shake at shadows. Isaac.
Strange cries, such as no mortal tongue e'er breath'd,
No mortal ear e'er heard till that sad hour,
Fill'd up the list'ning pauses of the storm.
The light'nings hissed, and flash'd upon the dead,
Who had for ages slumber'd in their darkness:
In the strong blaze I saw their livid cheeks,
[Page 19]

The quiv'rings of their blue and writhed lips—
Yea, their op'd eyes glar'd strangely on the living
With fire not of life.—I call'd on thee;
But, while I spoke, the human form drop'd from thee;
And thou a serpent, stood erect before me,
With glaring eyes, and scales made bright with anger.
I heard thy hiss, and the next moment felt
Thy coil ring round me with an iron grasp,
Bruising and crushing; and thy fiery tongue
Shot, like a burning arrow, in mine eyes—
Horror!—the very memory is madness!
I will not follow thee. Brian.
                                         Thou must—thou shalt. Isaac.
How say you? Brian.
                     Follow me. Isaac.
                                         Thy wrath betrays thee.
[75]   Thou art not the Palmer. Brian.
                                         Hence then with disguise. Isaac.
The dream was truth. Brian.
                                         This avails thee not.
If by denial, slow consent, or cries,
You check my purpose, in that instant is
My dagger at your heart. Now follow, Jew. Isaac.
Have pity on mine age. Brian.
                                         Jew, wilt thou follow? Isaac.
I can not—dare not. Brian.
Dog, die like a dog. As Brian attempts to stab Isaac, the Palmer suddenly enters and arrests his hand. Palmer.
Hold—noble Templar. Brian.
                     Slave. Palmer.
                                         Strike if you dare,
Cold midnight murderer; but yet beware;
We're Cedric's guests, who wants nor will, nor means,
T'avenge his broken hospitality. Brian.
The present hour is thine; but triumph not;
A time will come, when you shall both well wish
This had not been; I will pursue revenge
[Page 20]

In earth, and air, and water, aye in fire. Isaac.
Oh, Christian—no—hence with ye, pride and hate;
My heart's a humble dwelling, and you love
To throne in more ambitious habitations.
Your pardon, Christian; let the past be past:
[100]   Accept my hand. Brian.
                                         Accept my vow of hate.
Where now I would have taken grains of gold,
I will have tons; Look to it, Jew. Palmer.
                                         Indeed!                                          Violent storm. Isaac.
Hark! how the tempest roars! Does not its voice
Chide thy vain savage boasting? Dost not feel
Another world is clipping thee about?
The howling wind makes faint thy loudest cries!
The thunder shows thee as a sickly babe
Screaming weak anger!—Hark! how it shakes these walls!
While thy poor breath will scarcely move a rush. A violent burst of wind beats open the window, and shows the blighted arm of an oak. Isaac.
Ha! see yon blasted oak that flings its arm
Across the window—Once that arm was stout—
Ay, stouter than thine own—Proud earthworm, look!
Behold!—as that once was, so hast thou been;—
As that is now, so shalt thou be—                                          To the Palmer.
                                         Come! Come! The Palmer and Isaac go out. Brian remains as if stupified.

END OF ACT I.

[Page 21]
ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Isaac and Miriam. Isaac.
O Jacob! what a losing venture's this! Miriam.
But, uncle,— Isaac.
                                         O, my gold, my food! my fire!
My light! my raiment! Miriam.
                                         Yet you gave the coin
To Prince John freely. Isaac.
My gold! Is't not my child? Child of my toil?
My comfort in adversity, my joy
In prosperous hours,—pillow of my rest,
Companion of my day? Shall I not weep? Miriam.
                                         Take comfort to thee yet;
The loss is not so great. Isaac.
                                         The loss not great?
Fifty zecchins!—not great! By Jacob's staff,
I'd rather they should suck so many drops
Of blood from these old veins, that ill can spare them,
Than e'en the tenth division of that sum. Miriam.
Think of this, uncle, as the merchant does,
Who flings his precious venture to the waves
To save his bark from sinking. Isaac.
                                         Talk not, child;
Talk not to me, my spirit is too sad. Miriam.
Shall I sing to you? you were wont to love the melody of song.
[Page 22]
Isaac.
                                         Do what you list,
[25]   But offer me no comfort—I am sad—
Sad even to weeping.                                          Isaac sits down. BALLAD— Miriam.

   A Knight went forth to Palestine;
      Ave Maria!
   But first he knelt at the marriage shrine,
   And said to his virgin bride, “Thou'rt mine,”
      Fairest Maria!

   His arm was strong, his voice was sweet,
      Ave Maria!
   And sang to the tramp of horses' feet,
   As man to man the bright squadrons meet,
      “Fame and Maria.”

   He fell, and to his squire he said,
      Ave Maria!
   “Cut the dark locks from my dying head,
   Say, as you give them to her I've wed,
      In death Maria's.”

   He brought them to the virgin bride;
      Ave Maria!
   She wept as the locks to her harp she tied,
   Which still, as the wind blew o'er them, sigh'd,
      “Fairest Maria.” Isaac.
                                         I do bethink me now,
There is another loss; the goodly steed
And the rich armour, lent to that young knight
[50]   Who did protect me in the Saxon's hall,
Who can he be? and wherefore thus disguis'd
In Palmer's gear? But what is that to me?
My lendings—the brave horse—the armour too—
'Tis they that I should think of. Miriam.
                                         Do not doubt.
He was an honest youth; his voice was truth. Isaac.
It may be so; I think it is; and yet
'Tis a large venture; one that makes me poor
E'en to suppose its loss. Miriam.
                                         'Twill not be lost. Isaac.
But if it should—A bad race are these Christians;
[Page 23]

Gold in their hands is snow; it melts away
In their hot grasp to water;—Well; well; well;
'Tis a good youth; he us'd the poor old Jew
With gentle words, and gentler action;—yet
I would my lendings were safe home again. The Palmer enters in armour. Palmer.
My friend! Isaac.
                     The Palmer. Palmer.
                                         Nay, the Palmer Knight,
Since I have put on armour. Isaac.
                                         Miriam!—Go—                                          (Exit Miriam.
Well; and how art thou?—Is mine armour safe?
My good horse too?—O, 'twas a cruel fight!
Heav'ns! what a crash!—Mine ears ring with it still!
[75]   Good youth—for my sake do not put thy life
Unto such fearful peril—pray you now. Palmer.
I thank thy kindness, and now list my speech.
I was the victor. Isaac.
                                         Ay, you were!—You were—
You dash'd them to the earth as ocean flings
The sea-weed on the rock. Palmer.
                                         I've sold the spoils,
As is our use. Isaac.
                                         You come to pay the loan
Of the good steed and armour. Palmer.
                                         Even so. Isaac.
Gold—pure, bright gold—and yet—no— Palmer.
                                         Why is this? Isaac.
Take it again; in my hands 'twould be lead,
And weigh me to the earth—You need its use;
I have enough—What did I say?—I'm poor—
Believe it, youth, most miserably poor—
But keep it—keep it—you did peril life
To save this worthless body!—Oh, my heart
Warms to thee, and—and—when the old man dies,
Perhaps you'll drop a tear upon his grave.
[Page 24]
Enter Rebecca. Rebecca.
Tubal would speak with you; his bus'ness craves
An instant answer. Isaac.
                                         Tarry thou awhile
[100]   Till my return.                                          (Exit Isaac. Palmer.
                                         Fair lady, lend your ear;
I am the friend of Ivanhoe. Rebecca.
                                         Indeed—
Does he still love. (Aside) Forbid it maiden pride—
Does he still love his country? Palmer.
                                         How! so cold! Rebecca.
You anwer not—or is he still unchang'd? Palmer.
No, lady. Rebecca.
                     No! Palmer.
                                         No, lady; care with him
Has done the work of time. His youth is old. Rebecca.
I spoke not of the outward form. Palmer.
                                         Alas!
When unripe blossoms lose their outward show,
Is't not because the worm within is busy,
Working like change. Rebecca.
                                         Be freer of thy speech. Palmer.
Lady—lady, his heart is well nigh broke:
The blood is seething in his veins, more hot
Than the hot sands the desert flings in scorn
Against his face. Rebecca.
                                         Oh, alas!
This sorrow is too great! My tears will flow. Palmer.
Sorrow! you know it not: a few salt tears
[125]   That fall and are forgotten are not sorrow.
It is not thus he grieves; with hollow eyes,
With famished cheeks, with nightly groans, he lifts
The voice of his despair to Heaven—tears!
The desert has no tears; and, where grief is,
There is a desert. Rebecca.
                                         Palmer, you speak this
Too well, and yet too ill.
[Page 25]
Palmer.
                                         My jealous doubt—
I do conjure you, answer that I ask:
Or if that maiden modesty deny
The lips' confession, to a stranger ear—
Then give that scarf, and it shall be a sign
Thy love is still to Ivanhoe. Rebecca. (aside)
                                         There is
A soft seduction in his speech that steals
With magic influence to the heart,
As odours on the senses. Palmer.
                                         Wilt thou not
Wilt thou not give the scarf? Rebecca.
                                         Stranger! 'tis thine. Palmer.
And Ivanhoe is thine;—I know his heart. Rebecca.
Stranger, who art thou?—Oh, I do suspect— Palmer.
I've sworn an oath, and on the holy cross,
Not to divulge me unless force compel,
[150]   'Till he, who bound, unloose the oath. Rebecca.
                                         Thy hand. Palmer.
Thou hast it, maid. Rebecca.
                     The ring—you are,— Palmer.
                                         Thine,—ever thine. Rebecca.
Is't real?—Is it not a dream?—No, no—
I feel my heart is throbbing 'gainst thy hand—
I have thee,—hold thee—ne'er to part again. Miriam, Enters. Miriam.
Mine uncle calls.
                                         Trumpet. Palmer.
And hark, the trumpet calls me to the Tourney. Rebecca.
Yet stay,
If still thy father's wrath pursue us. Palmer.
I will appeal unto a father's heart. Rebecca.
But if it fail— Palmer.
                                         To heaven and my sword. Miriam.
You know this stranger? Rebecca.
I.
[Page 26]
Miriam.
It seems so. Rebecca.
Come. Miriam.
                                         Your cheek is pale— Rebecca.
'Tis nothing, 'twill away
The breath of morn grows warm and sickly here,
I scarce respire—O let me drink the air.                                          (Exit. SCENE II. —A Forest. Robin Hood, Scarlet, and Foresters, seated round a fire. GLEE.

   Others, like the sickly rose,
      Bloom but in the day's broad light;
   But our blood more warmly glows,
      In the darkness of the night.

   Night it is whose magic pow'r,
      Tints the cheek, and melts the soul;
   Night, that bids the wine's red show'r
      Drop more sparkling from the bowl. Scarlet.
How swift the time has fled: the length of night
Has seem'd but as an hour—nay, scarce so much.
What thinks our Captain, noble Robin Hood? Robin Hood.
I think, friend Scarlet, 'tis good time we chang'd
The goblet for the bow—I'faith the morn
Is blushing at our pranks. Scarlet.
                                         Good sooth now,
Her worship is too modest— Robin Hood.
                                         You forget;
You must be quick, an you have any will
To this day's tournament.—Your bows, my friends.                                          (Exeunt all but Robin Hood and Scarlet. Robin Hood.
May our brother Saxons gain,
As they did yesterday, the prize of valor. Scarlet.
And most the Palmer Knight!
He shew'd himself a right one. Robin Hood.
Aye: an he strike to-day as he did yesterday—
[Page 27]

[25]   St. George! The Normans dropt before his blows,
Like mellow fruit before the winds of autumn.
Didst see how Prince John writh'd his nether lip?
St. Withold's curse upon him!— Scarlet.
                                         'Tis a churl! Robin Hood.
Would that our Richard were safe home again!
He, though a Norman, is a king for Saxons—
Poor Isaac, too— Scarlet.
                                         Why yes, the Prince drank deep
Of Isaac's purse—but that is little matter;
The Jew is but a Jew Robin Hood.
                                         He's an open heart,
Though somewhat a close hand. When I lay ill,
Fest'ring with wounds, a price upon my head,
He wasted gold on my necessities;
While his fair daughter, kind Rebecca, was
The surgeon to my sickness. Scarlet.
                                         People say,
Her skill is borrow'd of the devil— Robin Hood.
                                         Tush. Scarlet.
Laugh as you will; I'm partly of their faith
Who say she is a witch. Robin Hood.
                                         More fool art thou;
The Jew's a kind old soul, who loves his coin
Perhaps too much, yet works withal more good
[50]   Than those of better name. I say again,
He nurs'd my sickness, fed my need with gold—
How many Christians, think you, had done so? Scarlet.
Not one of my acquaintance—Well; I've heard
The Jews were skilful doctors—tis, indeed,
Their quality of fame—but this—in faith,
You must allow my wonder. Wamba enters hastily. Robin Hood.
Whither so fast, good fool? Wamba.
Out of the way of nuncle Cedric—Such news—
[Page 28]

First the Jew turn'd out to be Ivanhoe—
No—Ivanhoe turn'd out to be the Jew—
No, I don't mean that— Robin Hood.
Gramercy, fool; thou tell'st thy story well— Wamba.
First, Prince John took Isaac's purse from him, as he did yesterday,
Whereat the Jew march'd off from the tourney. Robin Hood.
But your Palmer Knight— Wamba. The Palmer Knight proves to be Ivanhoe, and his kind papa, Cedric, no sooner finds him to be his son, than off he flies, growling and cursing by all the Saints in the Calendar. Oh, 'tis rare sport. And now young Ivanhoe is fighting for the tourney's prize with Brian; and, I'faith, yonder is nuncle Cedric —I am off.
                                         (Wamba hurries out. Robin Hood. Come, Scarlet, to the fray. A curse upon these Normans.
                                         (Exit.

END OF THE SECOND ACT.

[Page 29]
ACT III. SCENE I. —The garden belonging to Miriam's house— Ivanhoe and Rebecca seated. Ivanhoe.
Oh! would this hour were long as it is sweet!
Then would it never end. Rebecca.
                                         But why, my friend,
This brow of sadness? Trust me now, it seems
To chide my happier thought—Is't sickness clouds
Thy better self? Ivanhoe.
                                         Thanks to thy loving care,
My wounds are whole—I would not make thee blush
With thine own praise, yet sooth thy healing skill
Exceeds the surgeon's art no marvel, fame
Taxes thee, Love, with witchcraft—true indeed
There's witchcraft in thine eye. Rebecca.
                                         This flatt'ring strain
Shows more like mirth, and therefore I'll not chide it.
But how could I do less, when love for me
Had clos'd against thy need a father's door? Ivanhoe.
Talk not of him—Rebecca. I must leave thee. Rebecca.
You go with us to York—This very hour
We leave mine uncle on our journey home. Ivanhoe.
Thou shalt know all—King Richard is return'd,
At whose command I came to try the land,
For fame told many stories of dark plots
Laid by his brother 'gainst his life and throne.
[Page 30]

His will now bids me join him—Therefore list:
[25]   Sev'n years I've lov'd you—lov'd as few have lov'd—
Nor frown of friends, nor time, nor distance, nor
The thousand forms of beauty, e'er have made
My love forgetful of its first-born vow.
Now, then, reward that love—let marriage join
Our hands, whose hearts have been so long but one. Rebecca.
Oh! not for worlds would I bring on thy head
A father's curse. Enter Cedric—Ivanhoe kneels. Ivanhoe.
                                         To see thee here is joy
Beyond my hope. Rebecca. (aside)
                                         Why do I tremble? I
Have done no wrong. Cedric.
                                         What skills thy bended knee?
Bend thy proud stubborn heart—Arise, young man.
Arise, I say—I would not ought but Heav'n
Should witness Cedric's race upon the knee. Ivanhoe.
Your pardon first. Cedric.
                                         Arise, I say, and list.
I wish'd to hate thee; but this foolish heart
Plays false with reason, and I come to sue,
To beg of mine own son—Fly from this witch— Rebecca. (aside).
Be still, proud heart. Ivanhoe.
                                         She sav'd my life. Cedric.
'Twere better you had died, than so been sav'd.
But I'll not waste more speech—My hand is rais'd—
[50]   Speak—shall it bless or curse thee? Rebecca.
                                         Let me speak—
I've lov'd your son—have dearly, truly lov'd him—
And oh, must love him still; but from this hour
Mine eye shall be a stranger to his sight. Ivanhoe.
Rebecca! Rebecca.
                     Thou'lt forgive him? Cedric.
                                         Hypocrite!
Thou wilt not leave him—'tis the gloss of cunning.
[Page 31]
Rebecca.
Believe the humble duty of my love,
That bows to earth to do thee fitting homage—
Believe my adjuration of yon Heaven,
That now I call in witness of my truth—
Believe—my tears. Cedric.
                                         Arise—I trust thee not.
And yet so like to truth—but no—arise. Rebecca.
Then, Ivanhoe—thy hand—Is it not mine? Ivanhoe.
Thine—ever thine—and bless'd that it is thine. Rebecca.
Then thus I give it where it most belongs.
Will you not take it—'Tis a proud rich gift
From one so poor. Cedric.
I am all wonder— Rebecca.
                                         Ay!
Thy wonder makes me wonder—Let it go—
I am a willing sacrifice; and when
[75]   Sorrow grows wild beyond my strength to suffer,
I'll think upon this hour, and then my heart
Will not quite break—will not quite break.                                          (Exit Rebecca Cedric.
                                         My son—
I do not chide thy grief—the maid is worth
An honourable sorrow—Pity 'tis
She comes of Jewish race. Ivanhoe (half aside.)
                                         She shall be mine.
I will not yield her for the price of worlds. Cedric.
Wake not a father's wrath—its fire wil scathe thee;
Blight thy youth's freshness as the lightning drinks
The verdure of the oak. Wilt leave the maid? Ivanhoe.
Shall I be false to gratitude—to love—
To mine own vows? Cedric.
                     Wilt not obey me? Ivanhoe.
                                         My father! Cedric.
Wilt leave the maiden? Ivanhoe.
                     Never.
[Page 32]
Cedric.
                                         Henceforth be
A stranger to my home, my heart, my race.
I banish thee for ever—Mark—for ever.                                          (Exit Cedric. Ivanhoe.
My father—Stay—He's gone, and will not hear me—
But yet there is good hope—ay, more than hope—
My royal master, Richard—He has pow'r,
And to that pow'r the will to do me service—
[100]   A word from him will force my father yield.
No doubts—no fears—I'll join the King,
E'en as he bids me—Fortune, I defy thee.                                          (Exit Ivanhoe. SCENE II. —Prince John's Tent: Prince John and Brian enter. Brian.
Talk on; I love Rebecca. Prince John.
                                         Faith, your heart
Must be the merest touchwood!—as I think,
You saw her for the first time at the tourney. Brian.
'Tis even so. Prior.
Were she of any other race—But she—
An infidel! Brian.
                                         By this blest light,
He is an infidel, who would not yield
Faith, honour, country, life, for those rich lips,
Those eyes where pleasure languishes, that breast
Where love might feed, and appetite increase
E'en by indulgence. Prince John.
Well, but your Templar's vow
Forbids all thought of marriage. Brian.
                                         Marriage!
I only talk'd of love—and I will have her,
Despite her father. Prince John.
                                         Were that all, there's none
Would blame the deed; but Ivanhoe, our friend;—
He loves the maid. Brian.
                                         Hell's curse upon the stripling.
In love, in arms, in ev'ry thing, her foils me—
[Page 33]

But come what will, the maiden shall be mine;
[25]   Ay, and this Jewish dog shall find my hand
Can reach him, spite of Ivanhoe.—The fool—
I meant no ill, but to his purse—but now—
Baffled and mock'd—a day will come—
'Tis not far off. Prince John.
                                         Well—well—e'en as you will.
The Jew is not within the pale of law;
And as for Ivanhoe—King Richard's minion—
I should not grieve if he were dead—but mind,
I neither sanction nor deny your act.                                          (Exit Prince John. Brian.
Because you dare do neither. De Bracy enters. De Bracy.
                                         News, my friend.
Fortune is kinder than thy utmost hope
Could fashion her. Brian.
                     But how? De Bracy.
                                         Ay, marry, how?
The Jew and fair Rebecca travel on
For York to night—Your castle's near,
My followers prepar'd. Beauty and gold
Are your's, if you dare seize them. Brian.
                                         If I dare;
What is it I dare not? You mock me, friend.—
But, speed our back! Occasion's wind blows fair,
And must be us'd, or its inconstant breath
Will fall again, and leave our vessel drifting.                                          (Brian and De Bracy go out. SCENE III. —The outside of Copmanhurst Hermitage.— Ivanhoe enters. Ivanhoe.
Farewell my noble steed! the kites and crows
Will be thy monument. I needs must rest;
My fresh scars ache with weariness. And yet
King Richard's mandate was most urgent. Well,
To-morrow I may join him. Ho—within.                                          He knocks at the door.
[Page 34]
Clerk (within.)
Pass on; disturb not in his prayers
St. Dunstan's servant. Ivanhoe.
                                         Holy father mine,
St. Dunstan is a kind good-natur'd saint,
And I'll be sworn can better lack your prayers
Than I your hospitality. Clerk (within.)
                                         Pass on. Ivanhoe.
Pray you point out the road. The Clerk of Copmanhurst opens the window and looks out. Clerk.
                                         Pray you pass on.
One pater and two credos you have marr'd
Already. Ivanhoe.
I am weary. Clerk.
                                         Rest thee then;
'Tis a soft bed, the green sward. Ivanhoe.
                                         Yes, indeed,
Rather too soft; 'tis soak'd with rain; besides,
The night-wind's bleak: I pray thee let me in. Clerk.
An thou art weary, as thou say'st thou art,
Thou wilt sleep soundly; he who soundly sleeps
[25]   Feels neither wind nor rain. Ivanhoe.
                                         Good rhetoric!
Yet 'twill not coax me to rest under Heaven
While you sleep under shelter. Clerk.
                                         Aye, in troth!
How wilt then help thyself? Ivanhoe.
                                         By breaking down
Thy churlish door. Clerk.
                                         Well said! but wilt thou do it? Ivanhoe.
Ay, by St. Julian will I. Clerk.
                                         Have thy will then.
But an I like thee not the better; mark—
I warn thee now—thou'lt find some little cause
To rue my courtesy. Now, then, walk in. Ivanhoe enters the Hermitage.
[Page 35]
SCENE IV. —Interior of Copmanhurst Hermitage.—The Clerk and Ivanhoe enter. Ivanhoe.
Shelter at least. Now for my bed and supper.
What says your holiness? Clerk.
                                         Your bed is there,
In yonder nook: for supper—'tis before you. Ivanhoe.
A bed of straw, and supper of dry peas!
What splendid fare! and wholesome too, or you
Had never grown so stout on it. For drink? Clerk.
There's plenty in St. Dunstan's well; his name
Be blessed for it. Ivanhoe.
                                         Umph! you call yourself— Clerk.
The Clerk of Copmanhurst; the holy clerk,
As some do add; but I stand not on that,
As being little worthy of the honour. Ivanhoe.
Exceeding modest! But the cupboard there?
'Twas built for something. Clerk.
                                         I keep relics in it. Ivanhoe.
The relics of cold ven'son it may be. Clerk.
Now I think on't, the keeper of the forest
Did leave a ven'son pasty.                                          He goes to the cupboard and brings out a pasty. Ivanhoe.
                                         So I thought.
'Tis excellent! he left some wine too?—Yes. Clerk.
I cannot recollect it. Ivanhoe.
                                         'Tis indeed
A trifle most unworthy to hold place
[25]   In your most holy brain; but search that crypt;
It may be you will find my guess is right. The Clerk goes to the cupboard and brings out a bottle of wine. Clerk.
Ay, by St. Dunstan is it!—Mighty strange. Ivanhoe.
Oh! very strange! Drink hael—But, holy clerk,
Had I thy legs and such a brawny arm,
I'd walk by moonlight, pattering my pray'rs,
[Page 36]

And ever and anon let fly a shaft
Among the deer—What think you of it now?
Were't not a pretty pastime? Clerk.
You see the trinkets here?                                          He opens a little armoury, of bows, cross-bows, &c. Ivanhoe.
                                         I thank thee well,
And make no farther question. Clerk.
                                         Heaven's faith!
I do suspect thy valour as thy wit:
But you're my guest; sing, if you cannot fight,—
Do something to amuse me. Ivanhoe.
                                         I've no voice. Clerk.
Nor fight, nor sing! and call yourself a Knight!
Thou dost not know thy craft, man.                                          Knocking without. Ivanhoe.
                     More guests. Clerk.
                                         Help! Help! Sir Knight!
I would not for my cowl they found me thus;
The knaves might term this hospitable feast
Debauchery, a vice I most abhor. Ivanhoe.
Vile slanderers of virtue! Robin Hood. (without)
[50]   Open quick:
Open to Robin Hood! Ivanhoe.
                                         Mort de ma vie!
The King of Sherwood forest and mad Tuck!
Now by my holy dame, a braver king
And more anointed priest, my travel ne'er
Has met withal. Robin Hood and Foresters enter. Robin Hood.
                     How! Ivanhoe! Tuck.
                                         St. Dunstan!
You know him then? Robin Hood.
                                         'Tis little strange, I know
The gallant Knight who won the tourney's prize;
But quick, mad clerk; do off thy frock of grey,
And don thy Lincoln green; we've work in hand.
Brave Knight, we need your aid. Ivanhoe.
                                         I grieve my hours
[Page 37]

Are number'd to a purpose that admits
Of no delay. Tuck.
                                         I'm ready for your work. Robin Hood.
Attend: your father, Cedric; the rich Jew,
His daughter, fair Rebecca,— Ivanhoe.
                                         What of her?
She should be now at York. Robin Hood.
                                         Their way, indeed,
Was thither, when Sir Brian bore them off;
[75]   Chance made me witness of the deed. Ivanhoe.
My arms!— Robin Hood.
Ay, now you speak it in a soldier's note. Ivanhoe.
Come on, brave friends! No pity—no remorse,
Till vict'ry, new launch'd, float on a sea
Of crimson water mid the shouts of triumph. Robin Hood.
Nay, while we talk, the time for deed grows cold. Ivanhoe.
To Brian's castle! Wrap the walls in fire!
Nought's for the coward!—all is for the brave!                                          (Exeunt omnes. SCENE IV. —A Prison in the Turret of Brian's Castle; in one Corner is a wide Fire-place, fronted with rusty Bars of Iron. Isaac lies in the corner on a Bundle of Straw. Isaac.
When will it come? the last strong fearful wrench,
That tears the struggling spirit from the flesh?
Sick! Sick! And life had still such hoarded sweets
For time to reap,—the kiss of infant love—
The smiles of social joy—the thousand hopes
That fourscore years had twin'd about my heart:—
And I must die—must rot in the cold grave;
And stranger feet will rest them in my home!
And stranger joys will laugh around my hearth. Enter Brian and Saracens. Brian.
Up, Jewish dog! Up, infidel!
[Page 38]
Isaac.
                                         Good Knight,
Be merciful! Brian.
Thou art my pris'ner, Jew;
If freedom be a jewel of high carat,
Thou'lt not deny its purchase at my price,—
A thousand silver marks. Isaac.
                                         There never was,—
There never will be, such a sum; a hill,—
A mountain 'tis, of silver. Brian.
                                         Is it? Well;
I will be gentle, and if silver's scant,— Isaac.
It is, it is. Brian.
                     Then I'll take gold. Isaac.
                                         Gold! gold!
[25]   Where shall I find it? In the earth or sea?
The coffers of my tribe hold not the sum. Brian.
The fire flame roars,—What think you of your bed?
For your's it will be, if you yield not soon
To that I ask. Isaac.
                                         You do not mean it?—No;
The father of all good ne'er made a heart
Of so much cruelty, and yet he made
The serpent and the wolf. Brian.
                                         Be wise, old man;
That fire will bite more sharply than the wolf;
That flame will grasp thee in its burning coil,
More fiercely than the serpent. Take thy choice. Isaac.
                                         I have no choice;
I lack the money. Brian.
                                         False, and vain as false.
I'll have thy gold; first, as I need its use;
Next, to thy grief, and in it my revenge,
For that thou sought'st a friend in him I hate. Isaac.
Look on my pains! Send forth thy angel, death!
Return me to the dust, that earth may feel
No more than earth.
[Page 39]
Brian.
Nay, come; thy answer, Jew;
Hark! how the flames are roaring for their prey. Isaac.
Would I were dead! Brian.
[50]                                            Hast ever felt the pain
Of fire but in thy finger? Think of that,
And tremble. Isaac.
                                         Flesh cannot bear the pang!
I'll give—I've not the gold—have mercy—mercy— Brian.
Dost think thy cries can move me? I have seen
The sack of cities, when a thousand flames,
As hot as these, have gone forth to devour
Men, women, children—aye, bed-ridden age
And puling infancy—and deem'st thou then
The screaming of a single, wretched Jew,
Can shake my purpose? Hope it not, old man;
Wilt give the money? Isaac.
                                         I will; you'll set
My daughter free; she'll borrow of our tribe
That dwell in York, and thou shall have the coin
Weigh'd to thee on this floor. Brian.
                                         No, Isaac, no. Isaac.
How else shall I provide it? Brian.
                                         That's your care;
But for your black-eye'd daughter, she shall be
My handmaid in the fashion of the tribes
Of Israel—a good example, Jew,
If wisely followed, Isaac.
                                         Art indeed a man?
[75]   Oh take what you've ask'd;
Take ten times more—take all—make me a beggar,
Let me feed in the highway with the dogs—
But spare my child, my sweet, my guiltless child. Brian.
Hope it not, Isaac; mine she is, and shall be. Isaac.
The horse leech, Sorrow, fix upon thy heart,
And gripe it 'till 'tis bloodless—Oh the maw
Of dogs be tomb for thee.
[Page 40]
Brian. (coolly)
                                         Thy curses wound not—
But has thy flesh a charm 'gainst steel and flames? Isaac.
My child! my child!—I do defy thee, else.
Tear me with pincers; let fire gnaw the flesh
From off these bones, with tooth that wounds but kills not,
That life may look upon its own decay,—
Still I defy thee. Brian.
                                         To the trial then! Shouts are heard without: clash of swords.
Yet hold! what sound is that? He leaps upon the table and looks out of the grated loop hole.
                                         Besieg'd! besieg'd!
The arrows fly in showers!—Ha! I'm struck. De Bracy. (without)
What, Brian ho! the castle is beset. Brian plucks the Arrow from his breast, and falls into the arms of the Saracens: while they are busy in staunching the wound, &c. Isaac speaks. Isaac.
Triumph!—he falls!—How,—do my curses wound?
Dost thou not feel them griping at thy heart?
Christian, dost thou hear me?
Thine was the eagle's flight,—high,—high in air!
Thou look'st upon the sun, and in thy pride
[100]   Made it no shame to tear with rav'nous beak,
The birds of humbler quarry!—What! thy wing
Is broken, flapping bloodily in dust—
May it ne'er heal again to bear thee up,
Where thou may'st souse upon the weaker things
That fly beneath thee—no—shame, Isaac—shame
List to his groans—list to the bubbling blood—
How his limbs quiver—Christian—I forgive thee.

END OF THE THIRD ACT.

[Page 41]
ACT IV. SCENE I. —An open space before the burning ruins of Brian's castle; The trees and hills are covered with snow; Robin Hood, Ivanhoe, and a party of Foresters, are sitting on the ground. Robin Hood.
Well, sirs, what think ye? Did e'er monarch feast
Upon so wide a table, or beneath
A canopy so rich, or 'fore a hearth
That burns with such a fire? Ivanhoe.
                                         In faith, 'twould warm
Poor old December with his locks of snow,
And comfort his blue nose.—A boon, my friend! Robin Hood.
'Tis thine ere ask'd. Ivanhoe.
                                         When first flames wrapt yon walls,
They lit me to Rebecca. To be brief,
I bore her to a cottage from the aim
And blank of danger, leaving her in guard
Of faithful Gurth; and back return'd, to save
A father's life! Robin Hood.
But to your boon. Ivanhoe.
                                         'Tis this;
See her safe hence to York;—the task were mine,
But that a bus'ness of no common poise
Calls me another way. Robin Hood.
                                         It shall be done
E'en to your wish. Ivanhoe.
                                         Her father, I much fear,
Has perish'd in the tumult. If he live,
Call him my friend, and let him find that name
[25]   His safety. Robin Hood.
Though he stood in my worst hate,
[Page 42]

No harm should touch a hair upon his head. Ivanhoe.
Your hand,—my father comes; you know your part. Cedric enters with Foresters. Cedric.
I thank you for my safety. Robin Hood.
                                         Thank this Knight;
But for his skill that led our hands, yon walls
Had burnt no jubilee for your release. Cedric.
I thank him well; yet wordy thanks are poor—
An unseal'd bond, if deeds stamp not thereon
The sign of value: ask then what thou wilt—
'Tis thine if it be Cedric's. Robin Hood.
                                         Fairly said. Ivanhoe.
I take thee at thy word—Forgive thy son! Cedric.
Were that you ask the purchase of my life,
I'd die ere yield it; but my word is past;
I pardon Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe.
                                         He's at thy feet. Cedric.
How? Dost thou dare? Robin Hood.
                                         Saxon! your plighted word. Cedric.
'Tis true; and yet— Ivanhoe.
Father! Cedric.
                                         Thou hast o'ercome!
Rise—to my heart. Ivanhoe.
                                         This magic hour makes sweet
[50]   The bitterness of years; yet even now,
While joy smiles on me as a new-trimm'd bride,
And would be clipt, I must perforce away,
Her virgin sweets untasted—'Tis honour calls! Cedric.
Then go, my son. Were I now dying, none
So near to close mine eyes, thou shouldst not stay
'Gainst honour's call—My blessing with thee—Go!                                          (Exit Ivanhoe. Cedric.
And now to York!                                          (Exeunt omnes.
[Page 43]
SCENE II. —Another part of the Forest. Foresters (without).
Nay, no resistance, Jew! Come on, mad wags! Robin Hood, Wamba, and Ivanhoe, enter. Robin Hood.
It is his voice—and Scarlet with his band. Tuck entering with Isaac, followed by Scarlet and Foresters. Tuck.
Room for your holy Clerk, my merry men!
I come, like to an eagle, with my prey
Clutched in my talons. Shout, merry men! Isaac.
The Christian shepherds these! Robin Hood.
What, Isaac! thou art safe—I think, mad Clerk,
The wine speaks out of thee, Tuck.
                                         St. Dunstan, now!
But wine's your only orator; he deals
Such tropes, such flourishes, and aye, speaks truth,
While this same sneaking, false, cold-blooded knave,
This soberness, will lie you by the hour,
And sixty to the hour. Robin Hood.
                                         But why is this?
I mean this holy war against poor Isaac. Tuck.
He is a captive to my spear and shield—Stand forth;
Rehearse to them my valor. Isaac.
                                         Oh! alas!
I am confounded; this old brain doth totter. Robin Hood.
Where didst thou find him? Tuck.
                                         In the cellar, where
They found me quite exhausted: quite.
Speak ye, my friends; now was not I exhausted. Scarlet.
[25]   Aye; and the wine-but too. Tuck.
                                         Ye lie, ye pagans;
Ye worse than pagans! But what recks this? The Jew
[Page 44]

Is a converted Jew, and knows his creed,
His ave and his pater as well—no—
Nearly as well as I do. Robin Hood.
                                         Is it so?
Say, Jew, hast thou renounced thy unbelief? Isaac.
Renounce the faith of my forefathers! Horror!
Scorn would hiss at me living, and, when dead,
My bones would rest with strangers. Tuck.
                                         Dost recant?
I'll jerk thee, infidel. He attempts to strike the Jew, when Wamba interposes his wand. Robin Hood.
                                         Nay,
No quarrels, bully Clerk; do on your frock,
For here's a brother. Tuck.
                                         I do kiss thy hand;
But for the Jew, I scorn him with my heels. He puts on his Friar's frock, as a party of Foresters lead on the Prior Aymer. Tuck.
Ha! brother mine;
St. Andrew's day with us; we're taking tythes. Gurth rushes in. Gurth.
To rescue, or she's lost. Robin Hood.
                                         Who's lost? Gurth.
Rebecca. Isaac.
                                         My daughter!—When?—Where? Speak!—Speak! Gurth.
De Bracy, flying with the wounded Brian,
[50]   Pass'd by the cot, and tore her from my arms;
Too feeble 'gainst the number that fled with them. Isaac.
And do I feel no more? Where are the sighs
The groans, the tears! that sorrow's winter pours
On frozen hearts? Oh, then our earth is sick,
When seasons from their wonted liv'ry change,
And winter frowns most gloomy in its stillness.
[Page 45]
During the Jew's speech, Robin Hood has listened to Gurth. Robin Hood.
An half hour since they fled? How could'st thou waste
The tenth part of that time in coming here? Gurth.
They bound me, and 'twas long or ere I broke
Those bonds. Tuck.
                                         My cowl then to a beggar's cap,
They're gone to Templestowe. Isaac.
At Templestowe—A hapless place for me
And for my race—Near those proud walls,
Her buried mother sleeps the sleep of death.
When shall thy servant rest his weary head
Upon death's pillow? Oh, my day has been
A long, a weary one! I fain would sleep. Robin Hood.
I have it—Prior— The Prior is brought forward.
                                         Write thou to thy friend;
If in three hours he does not yield the maid,
Her honor, too, unscath'd, I'll hang thee up
On yonder oak. Tuck.
                                         Promotion, brother, mine. Prior.
[75]   You mean it not. Robin Hood.
                                         I swear it, by yon Sun! Prior.
Well, then, it must be so. The Prior writes in his Tablets. Robin Hood.
You'll bear the scroll to Templestowe; 'tis scarce
Two miles from hence; shalt have the Prior's mule
To help thy speed. Isaac.
                                         God bless thee, Christian! Robin Hood.
Up, old man;—beshrew thy woman's heart!— Prior gives the Letter to Robin Hood. Robin Hood.
Here; take the scroll; the mule's by yonder elms.
[Page 46]
Isaac.
We soon shall meet again, and then I'll thank thee.                                          (Exit Isaac. Robin Hood.
Look to the Prior, Tuck. Tuck.
                                         I'll keep him fast:
Come, brother, mine. Robin Hood.
                                         And bear a sober brain. Tuck.
St. Dunstan now! you talk of what I drink,
But, never speak of this same wicked thirst
That still torments me. Robin Hood.
                                         Hie thee hence, mad clerk. Tuck and Foresters go out with the Prior. Robin Hood turns to Gurth, who, during this, has stood with his face in his Cloak.
Why, Gurth,—art deaf, or dumb? Gurth.
                                         Would I were nothing
Or any thing but that I am. I ne'er
Can face my master. Robin Hood.
                                         All will yet be well;
Come, man—a cup makes all things even—come,                                          (Exit Robin Hood, leading out Gurth. SCENE III. —Templestowe—Brian enters, forcing in Rebecca. Brian.
I have you in my grasp—no fooling, girl—
Curse on these wounds—wither'd the hand that struck me—
Your voice is feeble as your cries to help you;
We're now in Templestowe, whence all the might
Of all your friends, twice doubled, could not force you. Rebecca.
Will not a woman's pray'rs, a woman's tears,
Persuade thee from thy purpose? Brian.
                                         Nay, 'tis thus
That I would have thee—dew-drops in thine eyes,
Pale fear and blushing anger in thy cheeks,
Mingling their colours—'tis the hunter's joy
That the prey flies him.
[Page 47]
Rebecca.
                                         Hast thou then no fear
Of earth or heaven? Brian.
                                         Tush! an idle dream;
Thou must be mine. Rebecca.
                                         Oh! by thy father's bones!
Thy mother's grave!—By thine own dying hour!—
Perchance it now is striking!—in his name
Who sits above us, seeing though unseen,
Renounce thy dreadful purpose—let me go. Brian.
I reck not of the future—for the present,
'Tis mine, and I'll enjoy it—foolish girl!
My castle burns—I've fought—have bled for thee—
[25]   A heavy price to pay so light a toy—
Therefore, be wise; there's none can rescue you. Rebecca.
Yes, one. Brian.
                                         Indeed! I would well see that friend. Rebecca.
That friend is death. She flies up the Stairs and appears upon the Parapet.
                     Approach not, stir not. Brian.
                                         Hold! Rebecca.
Stir not—or from these walls that beard the clouds,
I'll fling me headlong to the rocks below. Brian.
It cannot be such spirit dwells in one
So soft! so timid! Rebecca.
                                         Trust not thou to that;
Despair is bolder than thy boldest thoughts;—
And oh! he is with me—he lends me strength
To look upon this depth that mocks the eyes;
He lends me wings for the dark flight, and thus— Brian.
Hold!—Hold!—Rebecca—By the cross I swear
No harm shall touch you—look, behold!—I've sworn it. Rebecca.
Well, I will trust thee, but if once deceiv'd— Brian.
Have I not sworn it? Rebecca.
                                         I'd not be the mock
Of my too easy faith—but I will trust thee.
[Page 48]
Brian.
Girl! thou hast done what man could never do—
Thou'st blench'd this cheek with fear. De Bracy enters.
                     Now? De Bracy.
[50]                                            All is lost. Brian.
What? De Bracy.
                                         The Grand Master comes,—your deadly foe. Brian.
This cannot be—He's ill in France. De Bracy.
                                         Deceit!
A forg'd report, that he might come, as now,
Unlook'd for—You well know his bigot zeal,
His hatred to the Jews—Rest well assur'd
He'll take advantage of our Templar law,
That makes it death for any woman, who
Shall come within our walls—And 'tis too late
To think of her concealment. Rebecca.
                                         Now you see
The evil of your passion; to yourself
It brings defeat—to me, dishonour.                                          The Grand Master enters, with Knights Templars. Grand Master.
As I expected—Oh, in happy time
I've come amongst you—Templars we in name,
But not in deed—Woman, who are thou?—Speak. Rebecca.
Rebecca—Daughter to the Jew of York. Grand Master.
The witch, the sorc'ress—whose unholy cures
Are famous through the land—thy very name
Is a foul scandal to a Christian ear.
Yet speak thou for thyself. Rebecca.
                                         What should I say?
You cannot understand me—that I feel—
[75]   My faith, my sex, my nation, all to you
Are witnesses against me: yet be just:
If Brian love me, call it not my crime,
My mis'ry rather—If I've given health
To aching sickness, was't an evil gift? Grand Master.
No, but the means were evil.
[Page 49]
Rebecca.
                                         The good end
Is oft corrupted by the means that gain it,
As death of one may be the life of many;
I've not dealt so; the good I've work'd has brought
Evil to no one but myself. Grand Master.
                                         You hear;
She doth confess her cures were at the price
Of her immortal soul. Rebecca.
                                         I said not so;
You know my meaning. Grand Master.
                                         Sorc'ress, thou shalt die:
Thy witch'ries have condemn'd thee to the stake—
But more than this; our Templar law declares,
Whatever woman enters any house
Devote to Templars, she shall die the death. Rebecca.
Not mine own will; force brought me in these walls. Brian.
The maid speaks truth; 'twas I compell'd her here. Grand Master.
For which good deed thy life should pay the forfeit,
But that I think thy heart would mock such pain;
[100]   Thy punishment shall be this maiden's death;
So shall one blow strike both offenders. Rebecca.
                                         Hold—
Since now the evils of thy cruel law
Are bruising to me, let me share the good
That law may offer. Grand Master.
Aye; indeed! What good
Can Christian laws afford thy loathed tribe. Rebecca.
I do deny thy charge, and will appear
In trial by my champion. Grand Master.
                                         Who will be
Thy champion? Rebecca.
                                         Who that bears
The name of man, and doth deserve that name,
Will to a woman's innocence deny
The peril of his life? There lies my gage.                                          She throws down her glove.
[Page 50]
Grand Master.
De Bracy, give it into Brian's hand;
This most concerns him; therefore let him be
Our Temple's champion. Brian.
                                         I—I lift my hand
Against Rebecca. Grand Master.
What! dost fear the fight?
Wilt have thy honor stain'd—thy spurs pluck'd from thee,
Thy good spear broken? Brian.
Give, give me the pledge. Rebecca.
[125]   Where, Ivanhoe—Where art thou now?
                                         Will none,
None of these numbers champion woman's cause?
No—not one. On the wreck alone
I stand in infinite despair; no land
Is near to hope. Yet while mine eye looks out
Upon the endless waste of night, one star,
One little star, unfolds its friendly light,
And I'm not all alone. The dark clouds rise—
Yet the star shines, the only spark of light
In nature's darkness— Faith is that star— Clasping her hands and looking to Heaven. Isaac rushes in through the crowd. Isaac.
I have thee—hold thee to my heart again!
But let me look at thee; art safe? art well?
Has no harm touched thee? Is my flouret whole?
Unhurt?—Unsoil'd?—Pale, pale, but that is little.
Come to my bosom!
Sweet e'en to weeping! Oh, my child! my child!— Grand Master.
Wonder has held me dumb! What can it be,
A Jew should dare so much? Isaac.
                                         I had forgot
The letter—I do crave your mercy here. He takes off his cap and presents the letter. Grand Master.
From thy hand, infidel?—De Bracy
Give it to us.
[Page 51]
Isaac.
                                         Bless thee, my Rebecca!
A daughter be to thee, as thou hast been
[150]   Unto thy father! Rebecca.
                                         Oh! my father, Oh!
Take thy poor travell'd dove unto thy ark;
She has been forth upon the wat'ry waste
And found no resting place. Grand Master.
                                         I've read the scroll;
It changes not our judgment; she must die,
Unless her champion prove that judgement false. Isaac.
Die! wherefore? Heaven! what wrong hath she done
To thee, or to thy people? Grand Master.
                                         How! dost dare
To bandy words with us? Hence! hence! vile Jew!
Wake not our wrath. Isaac.
                                         Thy wrath! the savage bear
Will turn upon the huntsman, when her young
Stand in his danger: think ye then the Jew
Less hearted than the bear?—Your pardon Knights,
My age is weak; take ransom for my child;
I was too rash; let money buy her free. Grand Master.
Not all the money of thy tribe shall do it. Rebecca.
Tarry not, father: fear thee for thy life. Grand Master.
Will no one force him hence? Isaac.
                                         My life! What is't?
Oh, if your thirst must drink up blood, drink mine.
Swill, swill to bursting! Dash against the stones
[175]   This crack'd and aged vessel! When I'm gone
I leave no mourner but my daughter here,
And it is fit the young should mourn the old;
So did I mourn my father; so, her child
Should one day mourn for her. Grand Master.
                                         I tell thee, Jew,
Thy pray'r is fruitless. Rebecca.
Stay not my father—Oh, thine aged hand
Is all too weak to turn the winged bolt
That, wreath'd in fire, bursts thy feeble guard;
[Page 52]

And, smashing thy young plant, bears to the earth
Its bruis'd and broken fragments. Isaac.
Be merciful! be just! make not mine age
A stranger in the land. I am a poor
Infirm, heart-broken, man; although a Jew,
No less a man;—your faith denies not that—
Take pity on mine age; blow after blow
Has rain'd upon this head; sometimes I fear
My brain is shaken. Let that pass. Look down—
Behold me in the dust! my tears are few;
But like these few thin hairs, thus show the more
The body's desolation. Youth may weep
Its grief away; but age's sorrow burns:—
Burns—burns, till that which fed it is consum'd. Rebecca.
Stoop not, my father, to these cruel men. Grand Master.
[200]   Vile jew! thy daughter dies. Isaac.
She shall not die. Brian.
                     By Heaven! De Bracy. (aside to him)
                                         You are lost
If once you speak. Rebecca.
                                         My father, tarry not. Isaac.
Hear, Heaven! hear—No children have these fiends—
I cannot curse them in their children—else,
Shed madness on them Moon! And thou, O earth,
Let all thy fruits be ashes in their mouths!
Thy cooling waters, fire!—wolves—wolves they are;
Then let them, like wolves, feed upon each other,
The brother on the brother; till, from lack
Of living food, they burst their father's tombs
And prey upon the bodies that begot them! Grand Master.
Shall I be bearded in my place of pow'r? Isaac holding his daughter to his breast, and stretching forth his right hand to Heaven. Isaac.
                                         Ye powers of air!
Come to my breast—and now send forth your storms;
Crush, crush us all to dust! one common tomb!
Wind! lightning! thunder! blow! blaze! and strike!

[Page 53]
ACT V. SCENE I. —The Jews' Burying Ground.—Violent Storm.— Isaac discovered sitting on the Grave of his Wife. Isaac.
—Awake! awake!—
Will nor this wind, nor rain, nor thunder, wake thee?
Thou must sleep soundly! would I slept as sound!
What light breaks through the clouds? not morn—not morn—
'Twas but the storm-fire—morn is yet far off!
Eternity freeze up the stream of time!
This moment be the ever! Perish time!
Or slumber but a week—a day—an hour—                                          A Clock strikes Four.
He will not—no he will not—morn will come!
My child will die—I do not think I'm mad—
No—no—not mad—But yet my brain's on fire!—
'Tis but the heat of night. (Storm) Does it not rain?
I hear the plash upon the leaves! and yet
It falls not on my head: the trees too sob,
And shudder in the wind, and yet no wind
Blows on this burning body.                                          Violent Storm. Enter Miriam. Miriam.
                                         Oh! through night
I've sought you, uncle: pray you now remove
From out the storm: fire, water, thunder, wind,
Contend as if for mastery; the earth
Is reeling, rocking to its strong foundation;
And were in flames, but that the clouds shoot down
River on river on its smoking breast. Isaac.
I am not mad—no—no—I am not mad.
[Page 54]
Miriam.
[25]   I pray you now— Isaac.
                                         What—Miriam?—is it you?
Go home—go home. Miriam.
                                         I only wait for you. Isaac. Sings:
   “Then Jeptha wept o'er his child,
   “Oh must my daughter die
   “For Gileads victory?
   “My daughter—oh my child—
Wherefore should men be fathers? they are curs'd
In children's love as in their hate.                                          Storm. Miriam.
                                         Come in. Isaac. Sings:—
   “In the lone wood let me die!
   “In the lone wood let me lie!
   “Winter shall my sexton be;
   “He will shake from some oak tree
   “Dry leaves, 'stead of dust, on me. Miriam.
My dearest uncle! pr'ythee now come in. Isaac. (Pointing to Heaven.)
He has not call'd me yet;
But he soon will—look!—look!—dost see?—dost see
Yon eyeless fellow digging up the earth?
'Tis the bald sexton Death—he works for me:
Ha! ha! hark how his dry bones rattle in the toil!
He stops.—Art tir'd? or is it deep enough?
To it again—He shakes at me his glass;
The sands are few—they run like mill- streams—look,
[50]   He comes—most horrible—so near! Keep off—
Stretch not thy bony gripe to me—I'll fly—
Fly to earth's centre! open—open—open earth—
Tis thy son calls thee—open—let me in—
Save me from death—he clutches me! too late!
Darkness and winter—                                          He shudders and falls. Miriam.
                                         Dearest uncle!—Help!
[Page 55]

Help or he dies—Is no one near? help!—help!
What can I do to aid him? Help—oh help. The sun breaks partially through the clouds.—Robin Hood, Tuck, Scarlet, and Foresters, enter. Miriam.
                                         He opes his eyes—dear uncle! joy! Isaac.
Who is it calls me? Daughter is it you?
The sun peeps through my curtains. Is it late?
What, Miriam, strangers—there was something here—
Some heavy cause of grief my child!—'tis gone!
Gone! gone!—all's blank. Robin Hood.
                                         The wrath of heaven sure
Is on the Jew: or else there could not be
Such misery to man. Isaac.
                                         Still not a word.
Anon, I shall remember. Miriam.
                     Dear Sir. Isaac.
                                         Hush!
I shall remember. Oh! these waters roar
So fiercely in mine ear—King Jeptha—aye—
I stood before his throne—The Templar Knights—
[75]   I cannot—no, I cannot. Robin Hood.
                                         Poor old man,
I need must pity thee. Miriam.
                                         Alas—alas!                                          The bell tolls for Rebecca. Isaac.
That bell—stay—stay—my brain!                                          The bell tolls again—Isaac Shrieks.
                                         I know all now!
Too well—too well, my daughter! Oh, my child! Miriam.
He weeps, and sense returns. Robin Hood.
                                         Come, look up man!
Here's good hope yet. Isaac.
                                         Hope! lead me to the place
Where, where my daughter—dies. Robin Hood.
                                         'Twere best, my girl,
You did to his desire; I shall be there. Miriam.
Come, dearest uncle, lean on me.
[Page 56]
Isaac.
                                         Thou'rt kind—
I love thee well; but thou art not my child!
I'll walk alone.                                          (Exit Isaac. Robin Hood.
                     How's this? Miriam.
                                         His daughter dies—
Lest some brave Knight against the Templar prove
Her innocence in arms. Robin Hood.
                                         Fine faith is theirs!
A holy crew, these Templars! By St. George!
Speed, Scarlet, to young Ivanhoe! Declare
[100]   What you have heard.                                          (Exit Scarlet.
                                         Miriam, 'twere best you look'd
To the old man; his grief is wild,
And may offend his life. Miriam.
                                         Ye kind pow'rs above,
Support my weakness in this trying hour.                                          (Exit Miriam. Robin Hood.
                                         And now as Richard bid
For Templestowe, that if these Templars dare
To beard our royal lion, our near aid
May swell his scanty numbers. Tuck.
                                         He'll need all:
The time was short for gathering, Robin Hood.
                                         Spy thou
The vantage of the time; see all—say nought.
Keep the door lockt, but throw the windows up, Tuck.
Go to,—I'll shoe my tongue with list; go to—
I will be silent as a mill on Sunday,
An unwound clock, an organ lacking wind,
Or as a woman's tongue. Robin Hood.
                                         A woman's tongue? Tuck.
Aye, marry—when she's fast asleep.                                          (Exit Tuck. Robin Hood.
Now, then; tough hearts, tough bow, and limber strings.                                          (Exeunt Robin Hood and Foresters.
[Page 57]
SCENE II. —A Room in Templestowe; a few closing chords of the Harp are heard from an inner Chamber as Brian enters. Brian.
How sadly sweet! it drops like odours! 'tis
Passion's own tongue, and speaks not to the ear,
But to the heart. She must—she shall be mine!
Rebecca, thou sad maid, come forth! She comes—
Her eyes weigh'd down by tears—as morning dews
Sit heavy on the tulip's golden round,
And stoop its burthen'd tenderness to earth. Rebecca enters. Rebecca.
Thou here? Brian.
                     Thy friend is here. Rebecca.
                                         Friends! they, alas!
Are birds that sing but to the summer. Brian.
                                         Tush!
Tush! take me in my meaning. Rebecca.
                     Well. Brian.
                                         Be mine
And I will save thee—save thee from a death,
Worse than the worst of thoughts. Rebecca.
                                         To live a life
Worse than the worst of deaths. Brian.
                                         Be wise in time;
You'll hardly find a champion. Say you do;
My arm is strong—the chance uncertain; pause,—
I ask thy heart—will buy it at the price
Of fame and name, so dearly do I love thee. Rebecca.
[25]   Aye, as bees love the violets of the spring.
To rifle their best fragrance and desert them. Brian.
Be wise, I say; Death, in his fairest fom,
When sleep hangs on his temples, and his hand
Flings round him poppies, yet's a thing of fear.
But when he comes, as he will come to thee,
With burning fingers plucking out thine eyes.
Oh! bethink thee well; can'st thou bear this?
[Page 58]
Rebecca.
He who lays on the load,
Will lend me strength for its endurance. Brian.
                                         Fond
And peevish girl, I do but ask thy love;
Which, given to thy lover, makes him rich
And leaves not thee the poorer. Rebecca.
                                         Aye! indeed!
Is not a maiden poorer in the loss
Of maiden fame? I thought, that honor was
To woman what sun is to the day;
Without which, all its beauties are unseen,—
Its roses looking nettles:—gone her fame,
Woman is poorer than a beggars' alms. Brian.
Fame, 'tis a dream! Oh leave this wintry land,
And hearts as wintry; fly to the rich east;
The quick-wing'd hours shall be our handmaids, each
With a young pleasure, partner of his dance,
[50]   Shall beat the greensward with her silver feet,
Like moon-beams dancing on a summer brook;
Odours shall gem their locks, which each quick step
Shall shake on us in showers, as morning's breath
Shakes dew drops from the myrtle. Rebecca is going; he takes her hand. Brian.
How, would you leave me? Rebecca.
                                         Sir, this speech! but no,
Let me be still myself, though his rude tongue
Is drunk with license. Brian.
                                         Is't not better thus,
Than doing as our sober grey beards do,
To sleep upon the sunny bank of life,
And dream of happiness. Rebecca.
                                         Look down—look down!
Upon thy servant. Brian.
                                         Oh! deceives not me,
I know your sex; ice freezes in your looks,
But the warm current flows beneath that ice,
As quick as when the bright unfetter'd stream
Is sparkling to the Sun.                                          Bell.
[Page 59]
Rebecca.
                                         Hark! hark! the bell!
Brian thou art a murderer—Again!
Hark! air and earth and water catch the sound,
And now by day or night, on flood or land,
Whenever time repeats this hour of death,
[75]   A voice from all the elements at once,
Shall shriek it in thine ear as I do now,
Brian, thou art a murderer!                                          (Exit. Brian.
                                         Hear me;—she is gone!
Now by St. Paul—Revenge! I'll be reveng'd!
Proud girl—Rebecca! wilt thou not return?
But for a moment—Still deaf to my pray'r!
So deaf will I be when thy screams affright
The vulture wheeling o'er thy head in watch
For his burnt offering.—Revenge—Revenge!                                          (Exit. SCENE LAST. A level plain, surrounded on all sides by hills, so as to form an amphitheatre. In the back is a rivulet, over which is a low bridge; on either side of the scene are rude seats, rising one above the other: in the middle is a stake, with chains, surrounded with faggots; near it is a black chair; six Saracen slaves stand about it, four of which bear lighted torches: a crowd assembled below; Tuck in front, watching the people: Gurth enters. Gurth.
What! Friar Tuck. Tuck.
                                         I answer not to that. Gurth.
I cry you mercy; you possess, I know,
A wardrobe of good names; and which suits now
Will't please you wear? Tuck.
                     Call me Clerk Anselm. Gurth.
                                         Good!
But what's your bus'ness here? Tuck.
                                         My curious friend,
That's no part of your bus'ness to inquire.
Howbeit, I care not much an if you know;
I keep a running reck'ning with St. Dunstan,
He scores me up my sins; I score to him,
Per contra, all my virtues: now it haps,
[Page 60]

The balance runs most horribly against me;
A round score of wenches kiss'd, as many deer
Kill'd in the moonlight, twice so many cups,
In twice so many days, beyond full measure.
These stand on his page, mine's all white; at best
Some lean-gut virtues written there; whereon
I deem it wise to join this holy work;
The burning of a witch will make all even. A bell tolls: a Knight enters, bearing the great Standard of the Temple, on which is inscribed, “Le Beau Seant.” Six trumpeters precede, sounding a mournful march; Knights preceptors, two and two, pass over to their seats. The Grand Master follows, carrying in his hand the Abacus, and takes an exalted place among them; the Banner, Le Beau Seant, is fixed behind him, and waves over his head. After him Brian de Bois Guilbert enters, De Bracy at his side, followed immediately by a Herald; these three take their places in the lists below; when all the above-mentioned are on the stage, the trumpets cease, and a Hymn with its Chorus is sung by the Neophites, who enter two by two in black vestments; a guard of Warders follow, in the midst of which Rebecca walks, habited in coarse white garments: She is led to the chair by the stake. Tuck and Gurth mix with the crowd. [Neophites.] Chorus.
   Jubilate Deo! Raise
   To high heav'n the voice of praise.
[25]         Jubilate Deo! Hymn.
   To the altar fire we bring,
   No sweets of th' Arabian spring,
   No blood of bulls, nor fruit of trees,
   But a richer gift than these— Chorus.
      Jubilate Deo! Hymn.
   With the heart of love we bring,
   As a sin burnt-offering,
   Virgin youth that else would die,
   Lost to thee eternally. Chorus.
   Jubilate Deo!—Raise
   To high heav'n the voice of praise!
         Jubilate Deo!
[Page 61]
Grand Master.
Our Temple's champion! Brian.
                                         Ready to thy hest. Grand Master.
Ask then the maid if yet she yield her guilty. Brian goes to Rebecca: Isaac enters, followed by Miriam. Isaac.
Mir—Miriam. Miriam.
                     I am here. Isaac.
                                         Lend me thine arm.
Look thou, and tell me.                                          He pauses, unable to speak. Miriam.
                     What, dear uncle? Isaac.
                                         Look:—
How does she bear this trial? Does not fear
Shake her young limbs? a horrid ghastly fear? Miriam.
I dare not look. Isaac.
[50]                                            I will—her father will. Brian returns to his place: De Bracy steps forward, and lays Rebecca's glove at the feet of the Grand Master. Grand Master.
She doth deny—sound, Herald, for our champion.                                          Herald sounds the trumpet. Grand Master.
Again.                                          Herald sounds a second time. Grand Master.
Again.                                          Herald sounds a third time. Isaac.
Hush, hush! 'tis but the echo's voice,
No trumpet answers for the Hebrew—none!
All that is human leaves us!—All!—all!—all!
Hear me, kind heaven! Hear an old man's pray'r,
Who bites the dust in agony—let these grey locks be death,
And each an agony! I'll die them all
To save my child—or in atonement take
These tears—this broken heart, this bloody sweat,
Which cold, cold anguish wringeth from by brow,
And save my child! Grand Master.
                                         No champion comes; but yet
[Page 62]

My mercy gives thee limit 'till yon clouds
Shall dark the sun; Go, to thy father go;
Bid farewell to the earth, and all of earth. Rebecca.
Thy blessing be upon me. Isaac.
Thou image of thy mother!—can it be
That ought so sweet should perish—look down, heav'n,
See how she lies on this cold wither'd heart,
A snow drop on the breast of winter!—Spare
My bud of spring, and let these white snows melt,
If such thy pleasure, into earth again. Rebecca.
[75]   A bitter hour it is! but it will pass,
As others oft have pass'd, of no less woe;
Time will moss o'er my memory, dear father,
And the quick hours, trampling o'er my tomb,
With constant feet wear out my epitaph. Isaac.
Thy calmness ghasts me? Oh, so look the dead!
So marble calm! So horribly repos'd. Rebecca.
Grief, like the waters of some chilling fount,
Whose coldness numbs the light woven flower to stone,
Has wrought mysteriously about my heart,
And frozen it to ice. Grand Master.
No champion comes. Isaac.
                                         The dark clouds roll—roll—roll—
Be hush'd, ye winds! their edge is on the sun!
Burst, fall in show'rs—look, they pause!—Ah! no—
They shut out light, and with it shut out life!
Why should I live? break, break thou stubborn heart. The Grand Master gives a sign to the Saracens to seize Rebecca. Rebecca.
Off, off, tis but a dream! pass—pass away;
What strange and ghastly forms—can I not wake,
Can I not shut thee out? I'll close mine eyes
They'll pass away. Isaac.
                     Rebecca! Grand Master.
                                         To the stake!
[Page 63]
Rebecca.
Tis real! oh, forbear! but for a moment. She clasps her Father's arm.
Hold me dear father! in thine arms I'll die,
[100]   Murder me here—I will not shriek, off—off—
Father! They'll slay me—save, oh save thy child! Isaac.
Stay, hark, a champion comes! I hear the tramp
Of horses on the earth! it nears—and hark—
A trumpet sounds! De Bracy.
                     The Jew speaks truth— Isaac.
                                         Again!
Earth, air, and heaven—hark!
He comes—he's here. Ivanhoe.
                                         A champion to Rebecca,
Am I too late? Grand Master.
How! Brian.
                     Ivanhoe! Rebecca.
                                         Thank heaven. Isaac.
The noble youth! a Sampson to our cause! Ivanhoe.
Dost license me thy champion?—Speak. Rebecca.
                                         I do:
Yet no, thy wounds are fresh, thy strength is weak;
Better to die than peril thee. Isaac.
                                         Behold
Thy father's agony—Rebecca!—child!
See you this furrow'd brow? Rebecca.
                                         I do—I do
Accept thee for my champion. Ivanhoe.
                                         You have heard
[125]   She takes me for her champion. Brian.
                                         I'll not fight,
With one thus half himself; go, get thee heal'd;
In fitting time, it may be I will scourge
Thy boyish pride. Ivanhoe.
                                         Twice beaten, and thus brave!
Do battle to thy pledge; or recreant yield. Brian.
Dog of a Saxon! arm thee to thy death. Isaac.
Most merciful! most mighty one!—Be not
His father's sins remember'd in this hour!
[Page 64]
The Herald retires from the Lists: The Grand Master flings down Rebecca's glove—Brian and Ivanhoe advance. Ivanhoe.
Why dost thou droop thy sword? Brian.
                                         What light was that
Which shot across my face—I am withered—blasted;
I've sin'd against earth and heaven—I die— Brian reels: his Squire catches him in his arms and unclasps his Helmet. Isaac.
Lo! heaven's wrath,
The strong one is struck down! though helm and mail
Tremble proud dust! your arms avail ye not,
Pow'r clips ye as the air, felt though unseen. The Templars lay down their arms.) Grand Master.
Give freedom to the Jewess. Take, old man,
Thy daughter at our hands. Isaac.
                                         Where is she?
An unkind mist is gathering between us;
Speak to me let me hear thee. Rebecca.
                                         Art thou ill,
Dear father? Isaac.
[150]                        Give me thy hand! Rebecca.
                                         'Tis here. Isaac.
Where?—Where? Rebecca.
                     You hold it now. Ivanhoe.
                                         Fear not my love:
'Tis but the first gush of exceeding joy. Isaac starts from the arms of those who hold him, and gazes for a moment at his Daughter. Isaac.
My child, wilt not, wilt not, to these old arms? Rebecca.
Oh my dear father! (Falls into his arms.) Isaac.
                                         Earth recedes—ah now
I feel the presence of another world;
The heaven's unclasp their gates of burning light,
The seat of immortality's unveil'd
Where the great mover beams mid'st angel hosts;
A sun 'midst untold stars—'Tis sweet to die. Isaac sinks into the arms of Ivanhoe: Rebecca kneels grasping her father's hand: the Curtain slowly falls to a plaintive melody. Back matter

Front matter
PROLOGUE. (Enter the Genius of Prologue, habited in a black gown.)
Once more, to greet a British Theatre,
Do I, the genius of old prologue, come,
From you to ask a boon due to my age,
And those delights which, in a better time,
I gave your forefathers: to you I come
To beg your patient hearing of my cause.
While Marlow painted, with a sweeping hand,
The wond'rous workings of tumultuous minds,
I held a plain, but just and useful, office,
To shew the moral ere the play began,
That men might catch instruction with delight,
And view, indeed, a mirror of their minds.
Shakspeare, whose soul of alchemy could turn
The dullest dregs of nature into fire,
Gave me a swelling and more lofty strain,
And bade me, ere his martial king appeared,
Announce his entry with high sounding words
That breath'd the trumpet's voice in every line,
And great imaginations that conveyed
The soul back to the very field of war;
And to his mast'ry who would not obey,
And minister to his unearthly greatness?
[Page ]

Jonson, severely conscious of his worth,
Made me the organ of his bold appeal
To reason and to learning, and by me
Taught men to judge him by his own just rule;
And sometimes, lifted past his usual nature,
Condemn'd and brav'd the follies of the time.
Then came a troop with Dryden at their head;
He scarcely owning them, but they delighted
With his example, that 'gan swell me up
With high and bombast sentences, and mirth
Began to steal upon my sober face.
Meanwhile my sister Epilogue, debauch'd
With low and ribald jests, no more address'd
The town with Rosalind's mirthful innocence:
Nor could the example of Pope's critic pen,
Nor Johnson's just and noble sentiment,
Redeem me from unworthy gaieties;
From this the better morals of the age,
Perchance its dulness, now have rescued me:
But still the trembling sycophant by me
Brays out in fears his unpoetic baseness,
Or buys your suffrage with a very list
Of weak excuses, which he hopes are needless.
To you I come to save me from this fate,
I was ordain'd for great men's greatest purpose;
In me you should behold the power of truth
Pointing with magic finger to the Scene,
And tracing in't the heartfelt application,
Making the guilty turn with paly cheek,
As they consider of my fearful words,
Shewing to man with nice discrimination
[Page ]

The causes that provoke a tragic end;
Speaking a noble, just, and moral truth,
And then enforcing it by great example.
To night we offer to your good attention,
The picture of a selfish sensualist,
One trick'd with many meretricious virtues—
False courage, generosity and coolness,
And able to do much—yet doing nought,
Save for himself—a man of worldly wisdom—
Mark him, and ponder deeply on the scene,
And turn the mind from listless apathy
To fit amusement for a human soul:
This reward claims our author—I have done,
And to your favor leave our bold attempt.

SCENE, MANTUA .
[Page 1]
Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A STREET IN MANTUA. Enter Claudio and Lawyer. Claudio.
And when, sir, will the duke decide this suit? Lawyer.
'Tis thought within two days. Claudio.
                                         I trust 'twill be so!
To linger in incertitude's the sum
Of human ills; the wreck'd and toil-spent shipman,
Who meets a fix'd, inevitable fate,
Feels less of agony, than he whose fortune
Casts him upon a drear and desart rock,
To watch, with credulous eye, th' horizon round,
And form each vap'ry speck into a succour,
And, sickening with hope, to die anew
With every fading object of his fancy.
I'd rather perish by the assassin's sword,
[Page 2]

Than live the gen'ral theme of sland'rous tongues,
The mark for ev'ry dull plebeian's pity,
The accus'd of murder. Lawyer.
                                         This will clear your fame,
And free your honor from all stain. Claudio.
                                         Oh no!
Honour, once wounded, never can be heal'd;
It is all over vital, and the wound
That stabs it—kills, 'tis tender as the down
That paints the gay and sportive butterfly,
Touch it—the bright and golden covering flies,
[25]   And leaves an earth-born worm;
As weak as is the timorous sensitive plant
Than shrivels at the approach—and more inconstant
Than weightless atoms trembling in the sunbeam Lawyer.
'Tis too fantastic for a lawyer's thought.
'Twas well, sir, that Lorenzo saw the affray,
Your case were else more doubtful, as it is
You've little cause for fear—two friends I think. Claudio.
Aye, sir, they were so: if they be so now,
Fortune perhaps has not deserted me:
Men's minds are oft the index of our fates,
And as our friendships slacken we may read
Our downfall. Nay, stay with me; you'll much favour me,
To cheer me with your company and counsel.
[Page 3]
Enter Lodovico and Alphonso. Lodovico.
Good morrow, sir. Claudio.
                                         I thank you for the bidding,
I've need of more good morrows. Lodovico.
                                         Nay, your cause
As I have heard is clearly on your side,
Your present liberty proves this, methinks. Alphonso.
Aye, doubtless; trust me all things will be well.
Hear you of Raffaelle, the new Count Cimaro,
The proud and noble heir of dead Antonio? Claudio.
Yes, sir, I know him well, he's truly noble. Lodovico.
We're going to his palace straight; to night
[50]   He doth eclipse his own magnificence,
Which ne'er was yet equall'd in Mantua;
His peerless spirit spurns all bounds of custom;
His ample fortune ranges like his will;
A thought with him's a deed. Claudio.
                                         'Tis a brave gentleman. (To the Lawyer)
Lorenzo did not speak with certainty. Lawyer.
Most clearly, sir, and plainly. Alphonso.
                                         You'll be with us
To night at Count Cimaro's. Claudio.
                                         No, sir, truly
My thoughts are now my fitt'st companions;
They leave me little time for gaiety.
[Page 4]
Alphonso.
I would that I could tempt you to the Count's,
All there are nobly welcome—he has a spirit,
Like Antony, to banquet hosts of kings: Lodovico.
But, since you will not, we must hasten thither,—
I'm grieved at your anxieties. Alphonso.
                                         And I;
But we must hasten to the festival. Claudio.
                                         I thank you,
Your kind concern much moves me, my dear friends,
But let me not detain you from your mirth:
Farewell. Both.
Farewell.                                          (Exeunt Lod. and Alph.) Claudio.
[75]   Such are the herd of men; 'tis not ourselves
That are the objects of their vulgar friendship,
The very outside dress gains more affection
From them. The bubble fortune is their idol.
But come, sir, for I fear I weary you:
In grief we're scorpion-like, and writhing, turn
Our venom 'gainst ourselves—
I'll strive to be more cheerful, and to wean
My thoughts from melancholy—will you please
Come tow'rd my house. Lawyer.
I wait upon you, sir.                                          (Exeunt.)
[Page 5]
SCENE II. THE GARDEN OF CIMARO'S PALACE BY MOONLIGHT. A retired walk with a Grotto, in the distance illuminated temples, and every appearance of festivity—music without. Enter Louisa and Maria. Louisa.
This is a scene more suited to my soul
Than the dull glare of yon gay festival:
Aye—it is true that music has a soul,
And needs responsive feeling to be sweet.
To me the melancholy mournful bird,
That pours her pensive plaint in this recess,
Is more harmonious in her soft lament
Than the full chorus in yon glittering hall.
It was not well to seek for Claudio here;
With him, alas, mirth dwells not—'twas a fault
To think he could be here. Maria.
                                         Nay, my dear lady,
I wonder he should fail to seek you. Louisa.
Oh! in his nature dwells so deep a sense
Of truth and honour, he would scorn to seek
My love—were't possible to think him guilty,
And were he so,—I fear I yet should love him:
He cannot doubt, should all the world condemn him,
His name would live fair as this holy light
In my affection.
[Page 6]
Maria.
                                         And yet you have never
Assured him of it. Louisa.
                                         Oh! a thousand times
By praising, loving, all he prais'd and lov'd—
[25]   By timorous glances, check'd with many a blush,
By the sigh half suppress'd, the fault'ring tongue,
The mute embarassed silence;—are not these—
Not love's assurances—but love itself? Enter Raffaelle habited as a Magician and masked. Raffaelle.
I have amaz'd yon idle thoughtless crowd:
Another sight like this would buy their voices,
To make me duke—if they dar'd think so bravely.
I do despise them, though I court their smile;
And yet 'tis well, my state requires their homage,
The homage that the fool or needy knave
Pays to the man who knows to use his wealth,—
Ha! who is this? she whom I mark'd just now,
Whose simple graces even fools appeared
To gaze on longer than on jewell'd dames,
And that's a wonder: she is somewhat sad;
I'll try a masking humour to revive her. (To her)
I have been weaving spells in yonder halls,
Calling thin sprites from forth the glassy deep,
Decking with instant flow'rs the barren ground,
And filling all the air with sweets ambrosial,
So potent and so perfect was my art;
[Page 7]

But here a milder and more holy spell
Controls my powers and bids me kneel your subject. Louisa.
I have no spell save what my fancy gives
To this inspired scene, and that's too pure
[50]   For fulsome adulation or the homage
Of one—the lord of yon festivity. Raffaelle.
O'er me a woman and a beauteous one
Possesses all the pow'r of strongest spells
In one soft charm, the potency of love. Louisa.
A charm indeed, like others but ideal. Raffaelle.
My friends will scarce believe this doctrine now;
But why prefer this sad and lonely shade
To mirth and joy and social gaiety?
Those beauties sure were formed for other gaze
Than purblind night, or the unconscious moon;
And to those ears the gentle tale of love
Should sound more grateful than the owl's dull hoot;
And that warm heart should beat with quicker pulse,
More vivid soul should dart from those bright eyes
Than scenes of weary solitude inspire. Louisa.
Alas! sir, I can scarcely answer you
In strains so courtly—I can gain no pleasure
From a fool's smile,—nor can the tale of love,
That's but a tale, spoken, but never felt,
[Page 8]

Give me delight—nor joys of courtly life,
That tedious labour after sweets ne'er found,
Repay me for the loss of gentler thoughts. Raffaelle.
Tis well indeed, my sylvan deity,
And lest your wit should change my nature too,
[75]   And wrap me here in rural contemplation,
Let me conduct you to my magic kingdom,
And entertain you in my proud domain,
With pomp that may outshine simplicity,
Not in your thoughts,—nor e'en perchance in mine,
But far indeed in theirs who wait my presence,
To pamper to satiety their love
Of wond'rous novelty—will't please you walk?                                          (Exeunt.)
[Page 9]
ACT II. SCENE I. —AN APARTMENT IN CIMARO's PALACE. Enter Raffaelle and Servants. Raffaelle.
Who waits this morning? Servant.
                                         Signior Lodovico
Attends you, sir, and other gentlemen
Are in the hall. Raffaelle.
                                         I'll see them; (Exit Servant.)
They are industrious; my last night's feast
Would weary stronger natures:—I am sick
Of this dull round:—that fair one whom I saw
Would give new zest unto my luxuries,
Quicken the lazy current of my blood,
And rouse my soul to energetic action.
I cannot live in apathy, and crawl
Unheeded and unknown; this vaulting spirit
Fate never form'd to animate a worm. Enter Lodovico and Gentlemen.
Good morrow, friends. Lodovico.
                                         We rise to greet you, sir,
And pay the tribute of our wond'ring homage
[Page 10]

To the artificer of last night's glories. Raffaelle.
Nay, my dear friend,— 1 Gent.
                                         No ducal pageant more
Shall ever hold regard in Mantua. Raffaelle.
You're pleasant, sir. 2 Gent.
                                         'Tis far short of the truth:
Nature was shamed with art's magnificence. Raffaelle.
[25]   Nay, pray you— Lodovico.
And the lady de Commenes
Grac'd well the hand of Mantua's prime lord. Raffaelle.
The lady de Commenes—I knew her not— Lodovico.
The beauteous lady honor'd by your favour: Raffaelle.
This is worth hearing;—she has beauty truly. 1 Gent.
Mantua waits but your award to say so. Raffaelle.
Her wealth and influence are great in Mantua. Lodovico.
Next to my lord's. Raffaelle.
                                         Her wit is well enough. Lodovico.
'Tis counted rare. Raffaelle.
                                         And I suppose—to end
This list of her perfections—she has suitors,
A regiment or so. Lodovico.
                                         They are not few, sir,
Alphonso—and the noble Claudio—
He indeed is most favoured.
[Page 11]
Raffaelle.
                                         Claudio!
My friend whose life's in danger; is't not he? Lodovico.
The same, my lord. Raffaelle,
                                         He's worthy of her hand;
And when the world gives out too that she loves him,
Perchance, tho' she ne'er thought of it before,
It may be that she'll marry him;—how think you? Lodovico.
To-day, I guess, my lord—will prove the truth. Raffaelle.
[50]   To-day? Lodovico.
                                         His cause to day the duke will judge;
At noon the court will meet. Raffaelle.
                                         I will attend it:
Faith I should feel an interest in their union;
'Tis very soon, yet 'twill be time enough.                                          (Aside.)
How stands he, think you? Lodovico.
                                         By the evidence
Of lord Lorenzo he will sure be cleared. Raffaelle. (Aside)
Not if a dagger's found in Mantua:
Waits Julio there? Servant.
                     He does, my lord. Raffaelle.
                                         'Tis well;
Perchance I may have need of him directly
On urgent business. Then Lorenzo saw
[Page 12]

Vincentio attack him? Lodovico.
                                         So he says, sir, Raffaelle.
I'm glad his life rests on so sure a cause;
I would I were his judge; and yet I doubt not
The duke will deal as nobly by him as I should:
I would do much to serve him in his suit,
Knew I the means—there was no other witness,
Save this Lorenzo? Lodovico.
                     None, my lord. Raffaelle.
                                         Nor needs there;
[75]   I think that is his villa near the road,
Where this encounter happened. Lodovico.
                                         Aye, my lord,— Raffaelle.
It is a sweet retreat, and were it mine
I should prefer it to the city—he,
I think, is seldom from it? Lodovico.
                                         Very rarely;
To-day he comes here to attend the trial. Raffaelle.
'Tis fortunate indeed, he is the witness:
My friends, now I bethink me I have need
Of a few minutes leisure, you will walk
Into my gardens; last night's sports are gone;
But there is yet some poor amusement for you:
Open the doors there.
[Page 13]
(Folding doors are opened in the back ground and discover a natural and beautiful garden with rural seats, &c.) Lodovico.
The pageant's gone: 1 Gent.
'Tis wonder upon wonder! Raffaelle.
Nay, nay, a trifle: I'd not have the ruin
Of a fool's sport remain to mock my poverty
When 'tis gone by a year; nay, pray you walk,
I conjure not by day-light. (They go out very obsequiously, and with much wonder on their countenances.)
Louisa de Commenes! the vaunt of Mantua!
The pride of Italy! she's not for Claudio—
Lorenzo shall not save him,—Julio! Enter Julio.
Her wealth, her influence, 'bove all her beauty,
Should grace no less than Raffaelle Cimaro—
[100]   Curs are no mates for lions: Claudio!
Beware my greater nature! little men
Are but the cyphers that make up my sum
Of power and greatness. Julio! Julio.
                                         My lord: Raffaelle.
A beggar feed upon such royal cates!
Julio, ere noon I must have one dispatch'd;
Lorenzo—on his evidence depends
The safety of my dear friend Claudio;
[Page 14]

And I would find some fearless evidence
To swear that Claudio attacked Vincentio,
And speak of other matters, which kind fortune
Has giv'n me knowledge of. I saw Vincentio
At lord Alphonso's on the very day,
Where he conceal'd himself, and from that somewhat.—
The needy monk I yesterday relieved
Seek and bring to me. Hold! I must begone
To the lady de Commenes—within a half-hour
Call with him at her palace; but beware
She sees him not. Here's money for the hand
That takes Lorenzo's life—about it straight.
Stay—if thou find'st another that may serve
To fix his death on Claudio—bring him to me—
Lorenzo will be passing from his palace—                                          (Exit Julio.)
She must be mine; with her I should outstep
[125]   The ducal pomp; I'd pass on pleasure's wing
The wildest flights of fancy; to my will
All nature should be chain'd: methinks already
I swell with the intoxicating thought.
Come, for the means.—Oh! this indeed is power
In its full use—to pile, and pile,—and heap,
Till the proud temple, rising to the clouds,
Leaves e'en the artificer in joyous wonder.
I see—I see—ha! ha! when I have doted
Awhile in waking dreams on the idea
I'll rise and form it to reality.                                          (Exit.)
[Page 15]
SCENE II. —AN APARTMENT IN THE PALACE DE COMMENES. Enter Louisa and Maria. Louisa.
'Tis near the time, Maria. Maria.
                                         It is, lady, Louisa.
Oh this suspence! this tedious chasm of being,
That so destroys our present faculties,
And wraps them in the future.—
This feast of yesternight was brighter far
Than aught within my memory. Maria.
                                         Aye, madam,
So noble and so brave a company,
The music and the glorious temple.— Louisa.
                                         Peace!
I think there is no doubt of Claudio's safety;
Why dost not answer me? there can be none. Maria.
I hope not, madam, nay, I'm sure there is none. Louisa.
That's a kind word. Even flattery sometimes
Is dear to us, although we know it is so,
And yet, I trust, in this 'tis but the truth. Enter a Servant. Servant.
Madam, the count Cimaro. Louisa.
                                         I am sick,
I'll not be spoken with; yet stay, I know not,
[Page 16]

His countenance were great to save my Claudio,
I wait his pleasure. (Ex. Servant) He should be right noble,
And fond of such a spirit as my Claudio. Enter Raffaelle. Raffaelle.
A fair good morrow to you, gentle lady;
[25]   Your beauties do not fly the sun's quick beam,
But shew like flowers, that, wond'rous as I thought them,
But droop by night—and meet the brighter day
With tenfold fairness. Louisa.
                                         You are jocund still, sir. Raffaelle.
Sadness dwelt not in Paradise—and here,
Eden's restored to me—beneath that smile
Grief can no more exist than pow'rs of evil
Within the light celestial. Louisa.
You prove your wit, lord Raffaelle, not your truth. Raffaelle.
Nay, that can never be, if saws be true,
A lover's heart feels deeply, and his tongue
Gives utterance to matter, more than words. Louisa.
Your mirth's your love, Cimaro. Raffaelle.
                                         Not so, lady,
Albeit I am not of that whining tribe,
Who, having no other fortune than their words,
Mete them out dolefully to a nasal tune,
[Page 17]

And strangle joy in their contorted faces.
Lady, we both are revelling in the morn
Of fair and sportive youth; on both of us
Fortune has shed abundance; in our grasp
Lie all 'neath sov'reign honours; we are plac'd
So far above the underlings o' the world,
Common events to us may be disport,
[50]   And while the tide of fortune sweeps down fools,
We stand the barriers of the puny flood,
And overpeer its rage. Louisa.
                                         Life's accidents,
If they harm not ourselves, may yet have power
Upon our friends; and in their fate we feel
The ills of being. Raffaelle.
                                         Why should we then link
Our greatness to their frailty? nature shews
In this, we should be faithful to ourselves.
He who would save a drowning friend from death
May topple headlong in, and die himself.
Great minds with great should join—and wealth with wealth—
And pow'r with pow'r—and all things with their equals.
In this, I still am speaking 'gainst myself;
For you, being peerless, never could be mine.
You smile, dear lady, might I hope that smile
Assur'd me favour in my bold attempt,
I should then dare to say, that all unworthy,
And poor, as I may seem, compared with you—
[Page 18]

Though those bright beauties, resting in these arms,
Would shew as brilliant as the lustrous moon,
On the deep vested bosom of still night—
Though none can equal that all heav'nly sweetness,
Second to none beneath yourself;—in Mantua,
[75]   The richest, and most potent, as I am,
I lay my love most humbly at your feet,
And wait in hope your soft and gentle kindness
To place it in your heart, to rest for aye. Louisa.
Good words, well put together, lord Cimaro. Raffaelle.
Say—a good meaning from an open heart;
But will you deign an answer to them, lady? Louisa.
I've not the wit to jest, as you have done— Raffaelle.
But to be serious as I have been. Louisa.
Oh! that were to say nothing. Raffaelle.
                                         Trust me, lady,
I've said no more than my full heart has prompted;
And ask from you a like sincerity. Louisa.
Then, not to wrong your openness, beseech you
Believe at once that I can ne'er be your's;
And from all further suit—I do entreat
You will refrain.
[Page 19]
Raffaelle.
                                         This is a lady's “nay,”
And therefore I am bound to disbelieve it. Louisa.
My lord Cimaro, 'tis no idle thought
Makes me refuse you, if you love me truly
You'll speak no more of this. Raffaelle. (Aside.)
                                         Is't so, 'tis well,
Ha!—ha!—I'll try:—I would not, trust me, lady,
Urge you beyond the deep respect I owe you;
[100]   Yet, for your honour, may I tell you this,
Injurious as I doubt not you will deem it,
'Tis said you will espouse the felon Claudio.                                          (She endeavours to speak.)
O! trust me—I could not give ear to it
Beyond the observance of a smile—I see—
I knew it must be false.— Louisa.
                                         No more, I pray you.— Raffalle.
Nay, I, perchance, should not have spoken of it,
But feeling a deep interest here to serve you,
I would not that the slightest taint should rest
One moment on your fame; and though I scorn'd
Even to repel the foolish calumny.— Louisa.
My lord Cimaro! Raffaelle.
I would pursue the sland'rer to the death,
If you but wish it:—'twas a sacrilege
To join that spotless name with such reproach.
[Page 20]
Louisa.
And why reproach? Cimaro.                                          (Hesitatingly) Raffaelle. (Aside.)
Yes, she loves him:
Claudio thou diest: heav'n has no pow'r to save thee.
Oh! t'was the very madness of their malice
To link imperial blood with a murderer's. Louisa.
A murderer's!—he is no murderer. Raffaelle.
Nay, I know not—the duke will be his judge—
No more of him—let us to sprightlier subjects. Louisa.
I pray you pardon me—I am not well. Raffaelle.
[125]   I'm sorry that I mentioned this report,
But I am guiltless of belief in it. Louisa.
Leave me, I pray you. Enter a Servant. Servant.
My lord, you are enquired for. Raffaelle.
                                         'Tis well:
Madam I'll leave you—trust me I am grieved—
Much grieved I spoke of it—farewell—farewell—
This scene will change 'ere night—'tis done—he's dead.                                          (Aside.)
As I return from court I'll wait on you:
He's not the first kill'd by a woman's kindness.                                          (Aside.)                                          (Exit.)
[Page 21]
Louisa.
Come, come, Maria; come, my gentle girl,
Lead me into my chamber—Oh! my heart
It leaps into my throat, cruel Cimaro!
Love him! oh Claudio!                                          (Exeunt.)
[Page 22]
ACT III. SCENE I. —A HALL OF JUSTICE IN THE DUCAL PALACE. Enter on one side Claudio with Officers, &c. and Venilla on the other, in mourning, and attended by Gentlemen. Venilla.
My lord, I'm happy to encounter you
Before I range myself as your accuser:
I would not you should think me of a spirit
Basely litigious, that would make this court
The arbiter where honour should decide,
And bear sole sway: still less should I desire
To prosecute vexatiously my appeal,
When you, had my lost kinsman been alive,
Would stand most justly here as the appellant:
But, as it is, beseech you, sir, to think
This course is but pursued to clear your fame,
And so remove all taint upon my love
Due to my kinsman dead. Claudio.
                                         I thank you, sir,
And trust that in the end I may shew worthy
Of so much favor in your thought.
[Page 23]
Enter Raffaelle and Julio. Raffaelle.
They understood me right? Julio.
Doubt not, my lord. Raffaelle.
Tell them to herd among the common rabble:
Be not you seen too near them; when they're sworn,
Let them go instant to my house. Lord Claudio,
Good-day; I'm glad to find the time so near,
For your deliverance: my lord Venilla,
I think you doubt not of his innocence—
[25]   This scarcely need be heard before the duke. Claudio.
I thank you, lord Cimaro, for your kindness,
But as I dread no malice, I would rather
This trial should proceed; to crush it now
Would favour rumour, not alone 'gainst me,
But my good lord Venilla. Raffaelle.
                                         It may be;
And truly 'twill be better since you doubt not
A fortunate result. The duke is coming,
And with him all the nobles. Enter Duke and Senators, they take their seats. Duke.
Before we enter on the present business
For which we are assembled, as an earnest
Of our high favour to the lord Cimaro
We do invest him with the sword of state,
To bear it as our marshal in our city.
[Page 24]
Raffaelle.
My lord, I humbly thank your grace; my service,
Poor as it is—is freely yours; my zeal
Shall strive to merit that your bounty now
Has cast on me untried. Duke.
                                         'Tis well, my lord;
Now to your suit—proclaim the court begun— Crier. I do hereby cite the lord Venilla, the accuser in this case, to come forward and prove his charge registered in this court against the lord Claudio. Long live the Duke!
Venilla.
[50]   My lord, I will not tire with idle words
The patience of this most august assembly:
I stand here to accuse lord Claudio
That he hath slain Vincentio, my kinsman;
And crave your highness' hearing in this cause
Rather for him than for myself; for I
Will, with your pleasure, wait his open answer;
First stating that which he hath not denied,
That by his hand the dead Vincentio fell.
If without reason, of a brutish rage,
This deed hath been committed,—then I crave
The vengeance of the law upon his head.
That by lord Claudio's hand my kinsman died
Needs no more proof than this, that he was found
Standing beside the dead Vincentio's corpse,
And his drawn rapier reeking in his blood;
If he deny not this, let him reply,
[Page 25]

What cause he had to kill him: on his answer
Prov'd by what witness he may call before you
My subsequent proceeding will depend. Duke.
Claudio! your answer to Venilla's charge. Claudio.
First then, my lord, to save the court some time,
I do confess by me Vincentio fell,
And grieved I am at the occasion, yet
To save myself this means alone remained.
[75]   For on my life the attack was made by him;
Lorenzo saw the onset, and I trust
Is here to prove the truth of what I speak. Duke.
Is lord Lorenzo here? Raffaelle.
                                         My lord, he is not,
He may be waiting in the galleries—
Let him be called.                                          (Exit Attendant.) Duke.
                                         Are any others here
That can bear witness upon this occasion. A Monk steps forward. Raffaelle.
Did you expect this evidence, lord Claudio? Claudio.
No, my good lord, Raffaelle.
                     I thought you knew him not. Duke. (To the Monk.)
                     Who art thou? Monk.
                                         Good my lord, of holy order:
Paolo is my name; a Dominican.
First may I ask—was't near my lord Lorenzo's
[Page 26]

The fray took place? Duke.
                                         It was; know'st thou of it? Monk.
Near there, my lord, upon that fatal day,
Chancing to walk in solitary thought,
I saw this nobleman, with hurried step,
Pacing behind the ruin's broken wall;
Ever he rubb'd with trembling hand his brow
That seem'd all pale and moist with agitation.
At last I heard the sound of other feet;
[100]   He rush'd half madly forth—I saw no more. Claudio.
How! Raffaelle.
Peace, lord Claudio!—the duke would speak. Duke.
Follow'd you not?—how was't you saw no more? Monk.
Alas! my lord, I am an aged man,
Bent down with years, and fearful in my nature;
He that would lay in ambush for a foe,
Might murder me. Claudio.
                     I murder thee! Raffaelle. (Half aside.)
                                         I would beseech you, my lord Claudio, peace:
You know not the emotion you betray. Claudio.
Can I hear this—and yet remain unmoved?
Thou liest, old man. Raffaelle. (To the Monk.)
Have you aught more to say?
[Page 27]
Monk.
I have no more—and that I have spoken truly
Methinks these years should witness: I have nought
To hope for in this world: look, good my lord,
And judge by him if I speak not the trhth. Raffaelle. (To Claudio.)
I feared this from your rashness—be more calm—
Has your grace aught to ask of this man more? Duke.
Not now—let him stand by awhile. Raffaelle.
                                         Yet stay,
Lord Claudio, would you I should try his truth—
Or were it best to hear no more from him? Claudio.
I have no cause to fear, my lord Cimaro,
[125]   In shewing all the truth. Raffaelle.
Then I've one question—
In what dress was lord Claudio habited? Monk.
He wore a large dark mantle which fell from him
As he leapt out the gap. Venilla.
                                         There was one found. Monk.
And as he drew aside his vest there beamed,
In the moon's gentle ray—that fell upon it,
A ruby bright and large—hung round his neck
By a thin chain of gold.
[Page 28]
Duke.
                                         Is't so indeed?
Sure that bright jewel, matchless in Mantua,
Which was found near, and which had once belonged
To the noble lady de Commenes was this. Raffaelle.
I thought that this would work. (Aside) Lord Claudio:
I know not what to say—ask somewhat of him
That may dispel this fearful mystery. Duke.
Lord Claudio, would you more with him? Claudio.
                                         My lord,
I do disdain to question him—to all
I do oppose Lorenzo's testimony:
Would he were here: my advocate was sent
To seek for him. Raffaelle. (Aside)
If found he could not help you:
Are there no others that can speak of this?
[150]   I hope there may, to prove this old man's malice;
And yet I know not what could tempt him to't. A Peasant steps forward. Duke.
Come you to speak of this? Peasant.
                                         So please your highness,
Going from Mantua homeward on that day,
Two passed me on the road; and one was muffled
In a black cloak: as they walk'd by, the other
[Page 29]

Said to him—“Two might do the business surer:”
The one replied—“But you have no disguise,
And, should Vincentio 'scape, that might be fatal.”
More I heard not, for they went on full quickly,
And I'd a heavy burden. Duke.
                                         Look around you,
If any be of the same height with him
You saw thus muffled. Peasant.
                                         'Twas about the height
Of yonder nobleman. (Pointing to Claudio.) Raffaelle.
                                         Art sure of that?
Quite sure? Peasant.
                     I am, my lord. Raffaelle.
                                         It cannot be:
Were you, lord Claudio, thus habited?
Who saw you on that day can prove you were not? Claudio.
I was so dressed. Raffaelle.
Yet there walked no one with you? Claudio.
[175]                                            There was one;
But for the rest I know but that 'tis false. Duke.
Who was the other? Claudio.
                                         'Twas the lord Lorenzo.
Who left me near his villa. Duke.
                                         Whither went you? Claudio.
Towards the villa of the lady Commenes.                                          (With Hesitation)
[Page 30]
Duke.
Your answer is confused: I fear Lorenzo
Comes not lest he should witness too against you,
Or else be prov'd accomplice in this guilt:
Would you ask more of him? Claudio.
                                         My gracious lord,
I am amazed at this evidence;
'Tis all a tissue of malicious falsehood;
I know not who has moved them thus against me. Raffaelle. (Aside)
He gasps within the eddy of a whirlpool,
And his last struggles draw him to the gulph.
Yes, he himself shall minister his fate. (To Claudio)
Yet, my lord Claudio, you have one hope—
If this arise from malice, I'll disprove it:
Let all the witnesses be taken hence. (Exeunt Attendants with Witnesses.)
My lord Alphonso, as I think, Vincentio
Was with you here in Mantua privately,
Upon some feigned business, a short time
Before he made th' attempt on Claudio's life. Alphonso.
[200]   He was, my lord, and from his secrecy
Yourself and I alone could know of it.
He passed forth disguised as a monk,
And changed his habit at a little cottage,
About a mile from Mantua.
[Page 31]
Raffaelle.
                                         'Tis well;
If there be any malice in their proof
They will convict themselves: 'tis plain he went
From Mantua thither; should the peasant swear
He saw him undisguised, and near to Mantua;
Or should they err, led by the gen'ral rumour,
To think that he was coming from his villa. Claudio.
I see it, good my lord, and thank you much. Duke.
Call in the peasant. Enter Attendants with Peasant.
                                         How far was't from Mantua
Lord Claudio pass'd you? Peasant.
                                         As I think, my lord,
'Twas half a mile. Duke.
                                         Saw you Vincentio after? Peasant.
No, my lord, I saw none save an old monk. Duke.
At what time did he pass you? Peasant.
                                         'Twas at sun-set. Duke.
Thence 'tis about two miles to where he fell.
Let them bring in the monk. Enter Attendants with Monk.
                                         Whence came the sounds
[225]   Of footsteps—from the side of Mantua
Or from the villa of the lady Commenes?
[Page 32]
Monk.
From that of Mantua, my lord, which seem'd
Most strange to me, when I heard more of this:
'Twas said Vincentio was at his villa,
But this way I am sure I heard his footsteps. Duke.
                                         Aye,
At what time was't you saw the stranger rush
From forth the ruin? Monk.
                                         Somewhat past an hour
After the sun had set. Claudio.
                                         I know not how—
This tale hangs well together, but 'tis false. Duke.
My lord, the evidence is mighty 'gainst you,
Unless you can excuse, or shew most clearly
'Twas in your own defence you did this deed,
I have no power to turn the rigorous law
From the dread doom of death. Claudio.
My lord, I am o'erwhelm'd—I cannot speak
More than—'tis false. (To the Monk) Old man, thy life is short,
And heaven will require a strict account
Of such blaspheming of thy holy office. Duke.
Exclaims are vain, unless thou hast some proof,
Or cause to urge to mitigate the law,
Thy life is forfeit.
[Page 33]
Raffaelle.
[250]   My gracious prince—if Claudio hath done this,
As it appears, some reason of strong weight
Urged him to such a deed: I cannot think
Without some deep and heart-felt injury
He would assassinate Vincentio.
Speak, my lord Claudio—confess the truth,
That justice may with mercy be attempered,
Leave not thy name an infamy to man,
For causeless murder. Speak, and shew thy wrongs,
It nought avails to combat this strong proof. Claudio.
No—I have said—some deadly unseen foe
That dares not bear his cause upon his sword,
Has prompted these to lie against my life.
I will not compromise my innocence:
They that have sworn this know that it is false. Duke.
I grieve thy fate, but know not how to avoid it:
Had I the power I would spare thee yet. (Consults with Senators.) Raffaelle. (Aside.)
Now triumph, Claudio, in thy lady's love!
The hands that should have clasp'd about thy neck,
May now weave chaplets for thy timeless grave;
Thy hymeneal song shall be a dirge;
Thy nuptial bed—the cold and lifeless tomb:
[Page 34]

Whilst I shall revel in thy mistress' beauties,
And quaff nectareous sweets from her soft lip,
As the dull grave-worm draws itself o'er thine,
[275]   My heart shall beat with ecstacy of joy
As thine shall throb the last of agony. (To him)
Oh! Claudio! dote not on the name of innocence;
Confess, and boldly trust the duke with all:
Thy state is at the worst—a milder sentence
May greet repentant sorrow. (Claudio looks firm but distressed.) (Aside.)
What! does this sting, lord Claudio? This is he
Who would wed her I love. Duke.
                                         There is no hope—
No power in the law—that can defer
Your instant execution. Raffaelle. (Aside.)
                                         There is no hope!
My dear friend, Claudio! (Aside) That such a thing
Should be Cimaro's rival! Enter an Officer. Officer.
The lord Lorenzo, faint and wounded, waits
For entrance to the court. Duke.
                                         Lorenzo wounded!
Let him come in at once—conduct him hither. Raffaelle.
Curse on the fool that let him 'scape. (Aside) Make way there.
[Page 35]

Now my dear lord—I trust your honour's saved. (to Claudio.) Enter Lorenzo supported.
Fool that I was to trust a common stabber!—
So the man dies they think they've done enough— (to Lorenzo,)
                                         My lord, sit down, your wounds are painful to you (Seats him in the Marshal's chair.) Duke.
Tell to the court how this befel, Lorenzo. Lorenzo.
Pardon, my Lord, I'm faint with loss of blood—
[300]   I scarce can speak, for, passing from my villa,
Near to the spot where Claudio slew Vincentio,
A ruffian blow left me for dead, 'till one
Pass'd by and bound my wound—at my desire
Procured conveyance hither— Duke.
                                         This is strange
And looks indeed like malice against Claudio.
My lord Cimaro, cause fit search be made
To bring the villain to just punishment;
For by his means we may discover more. Lorenzo.
I saw him not—I fell by his first blow. Raaffelle.
My lord I'll institute immediate quest,
If these things are permitted, there's no safety
For honest men in Mantua—I'll look to it.
[Page 36]
Duke.
But what says lord Lorenzo?— Lorenzo.
                                         Good my lord,
Upon the day—Oh I am faint! Raffaelle.
                                         He'll die;
Would 't were before he could hear Claudio! Duke.
Rest for a while. Lorenzo.
                                         My lord I yet have breath,
And while I yet can speak—I will attest
The innocence of Claudio— Duke.
                                         Thank Heaven Lorenzo.
I parted with him near the abbey walls
[325]   I tow'rd my villa, he tow'rd Commenes,
When turning to observe the rising moon,
Which shone full brightly o'er the mouldering arches,
I saw Vincentio rush from forth the ruin
And aim a deadly blow at Claudio;
His sword pierc'd but the mantle of my friend,
Who instant drew—and, ere I gain'd the spot,
Had kill'd him—at the moment that I reach'd him,
A Peasant too came up, who had not seen
More than Vincentio's fall—I would be spared,
For life ebbs with me— Duke.
                                         'Tis enough, Lorenzo.
Where are the Monk and Peasant? Raffaelle.
                                         Gone, my lord,—
I see them not—.
[Page 37]
Duke.
Let search be made for them:
Meanwhile lord Claudio—you are free—and trust me,
I am most thankful heav'n hath interfered
To spare to me the sin of too rash judgment;
Fearful indeed, is the dread task of rulers,
Had not Lorenzo sped thus to your aid,
I should have sent you to that fatal doom,
Which all my sorrows could not have recall'd.
Lord marshal see that search be made for all
Who have abetted in this traiterous plot,
[350]   And they shall feel the vengeance of the law. Raffaelle.
Doubt not, my lord, with joy I undertake
The task of vengeance on lord Claudio's foes. (Aside)
For were't another's office 'twere my death. Duke.
Break up the Court. (Exeunt Duke Senators, &c.) Raffaelle.
                                         Pardon, my dear lord Claudio,
That I have been so tardy in the offering
Of my congratulations—but my joy,
At your deliverance, was too full for speech,
You know, I trust, my friendship. Claudio.
                                         Aye, my lord—
I have not in my safety aught more pleasing
Than is the power to return my thanks t'ye Raffaelle.
I fear'd indeed I had been too officious
[Page 38]

But you will pardon it. Claudio.
                                         I knew your meaning,
And therefore could not but be thankful for't. Raffaelle.
That would be strange if you had known my meaning.— (Aside)
I must begone to order instant search
For these false witnesses—I will not fail
To see you shortly, and I trust to bring them
Within your power—so I'll take my leave.
Farewell—damn'd—damn'd—damn'd chance—but I've not done. (Aside)                                          (Exit.) Lodovico.
That's a brave spirit—he's a true friend, Claudio!
But that their cunning was past human wisdom
[375]   He would have sure discovered it—as 'tis.
You are indebted to him for the attempt. Claudio.
I think so, sir:
Come lords, we'll to my house, my cheer's the better
For so much peril, will you with me homeward?                                          (Exeunt) SCENE II. —A ROOM IN CIMARO'S PALACE. Enter Raffaelle and Julio Raffaelle.
Tell me no more, he should have stabb'd and stabb'd
Till all his body were a wound—that, had
Each separate inch a life, he might die all,
[Page 39]

Henceforth I'll trust myself—the monk and peasant
Conceal most closely: I must search for them;
Convey this gold to them—they've done their work.
Curse on the wayward fate that crosses me:
All causes should conspire to form great ends:
If I o'erleap the petty bound of justice,
And doom the reptile Claudio to his ruin,
What is the speck in the majestic world?
A thing that was—and is beheld no more.
It is all nature's custom, that the great
Consume the small. Who views the cataract
With less of thought sublime, because it drives
Some little brook back to its puny source?
'Tis greater by its devastating power.
Should one small cloud
Dim the fair lustre of heaven's varied arch?
Should the proud oak be rooted from the earth
Because its growth displaces some dull weed?
Claudio, my genius hath the mastery,
And thine shall bow to it: this arm shall do it—
I'll make occasion speedily; and if
[25]   I fail, 'tis but to bid him to a banquet,
And poison him in feasting. (Enter Servant) Servant.
                                         Lord Alphonso
Waits you without, sir. Raffaelle.
He may serve my purpose,
[Page 40]

For should I need the festal cup, his hand
Shall be the bearer. I await him here,                                          (Exit Servant.
He too was Claudio's rival, and suspicion
Were better upon him than me: let's see now—
To bid this Claudio to a feast to-morrow,
And on the way assault him. (Enter Alphonso.)
                                         Oh! my friend,
I wish'd to see you. Alphonso.
                                         Oh! my lord, command me. Raffaelle.
I have been thinking how to celebrate
The noble Claudio's deliverance,
And I design a feast to-morrow night. Alphonso.
To-morrow he is married. Raffaelle.
                                         Married! married!
To-morrow!—and to whom? Alphonso.
                                         The lady Commenes. Raffaelle.
Indeed! Alphonso.
                     Most true. Raffaelle.
                                         This is no little matter:
I think it is as near to you as me;
[50]   We both have lov'd the lady de Commenes;
And both, as I should guess, were griev'd to lose her. Alphonso.
Faith, somewhat. Raffaelle.
Had not Claudio been her suitor,
One or the other had had better fortune.
[Page 41]
Alphonso.
I am content to yield. Raffaelle.                                          (Aside)
                                         'Twere easier
To move a wren to combat with an eagle,
Than urge this dolt to touch a hair of Claudio. (To him)
Well, well, and so am I; a lady's love
Cannot obey aught but her fantasy.
I've an esteem for Claudio, and I've shewn it.
I freely give Louisa to his love;
And more to prove how well it pleases me,
I will not be denied his presence here
To-morrow night you shall go bid him for me. Alphonso.
Most happily, my lord. Raffaelle.
                                         And to the lady,
Who doubtless will not be so easily won,
Say this—I spoke to her the other day
To prove her love to Claudio, not meaning
Any offence by it, but if she lov'd him
To yield at once; and that I meant no wrong,
Methinks my conduct at the trial proves;
Were my heart rancorous 'gainst Claudio,
[75]   I should not thus have sought to save him. Alphonso.
                                         Aye, sir,
Doubt not I'll urge this. Raffaelle.
                                         Something further, in which
I'll crave your kind assistance: some of us,
You and myself, will, habited as peasants,
Conduct the festival, and humbly shew
The changes of the eve. Alphonso.
                                         With all my heart;
[Page 42]

I will engage some other noblemen
To wear the habit, and attend your guests. Raffaelle.
May I entreat you then to see them now,
I will not fail t' eclipse what yet I've done,
In honour of so happy an event:
Farewell. Alphonso.
                                         I will about it: farewell, sir.                                          (Exit.) Raffaelle.
So, so—his nature formed him for a lacquey:
He'll act it to the life:—to lose a lady,
And such a lady, with a less concern
Than monks bestow their scapularies: aye,
This gen'ral habit will much aid my plan—
It will divide suspicion, and I'll fix it—
First at my rapier's point I will essay him
In the dark portico beside my palace;
There will I have my servant Julio
[100]   Meet and detain him;—no delay—such deeds
Are better in the doing than the thought.
I'll bring her yet a virgin to my bed,
And crop the prime of love in her sweet beauties.
This marriage yet shall be a funeral.
Fate, like a mettled steed, has started 'neath me,
Only to prove the prowess of the rider;
But I will curb and spur it to my will,
And ride triumphant to the goal of bliss.
Security has lost more fools than Claudio.
[Page 43]

I'll spare no pomp to greet his death; the glitter
Will take th' attention of the common herd,
And keep them from too deep a scrutiny;—
This hand shall make sure work—'tis prompted here.                                          (Exit.)
[Page 44]
ACT IV. SCENE I. —A ROOM IN THE PALACE OF COMMENES. Enter Claudio and Louisa, Claudio.
We owe much thanks to our friend Cimaro,
For honouring thus our nuptials. Louisa.
                                         Think you so?
If so, his mind is chang'd tow'rd you and me. Claudio.
I think as lord Alphonso spoke of him,
That, finding he must never hope your hand,
With a true generous spirit, and to serve you
In aiding me, he came unto my trial.
If I am skill'd in him—he's of that nature
To gain an end he'd put forth all his means;
Yet the end lost he envies not the winner.
His pleasure is in the pursuit not gain.
There are some men whose happiness is action—
[Page 45]

To whom repose is torture—who hold nought
Indifferent to them;—such a man is Raffaelle. Louisa.
I'm grieved your friend Lorenzo lingers yet
In pain and sickness; but the wound's not mortal. Claudio.
No, thanks to heaven, their malice there has failed;
We'll to Cimaro's, love; I would not spurn
His noble friendship; yet I would not go:
I am to-day too full of quilet joys
To love a boisterous tumult; methinks joy
Dwells but in peace,—and such sweet solitude
As the first pair in loveliest Eden knew;
[25]   Such friends have yet a claim on our affections,
Which 'twere a dotage to despise. Enter a Servant. Servant.
                                         My lord,
Some gentlemen are waiting to conduct you
To lord Cimaro's. Claudio.
                                         We'll attend them straight:
Come, my Louisa.—                                          (Exeunt.)
[Page 46]
SCENE II. —A DARK PORTICO BY RAFFAELLE'S PALACE. In the half distance, an illuminated Hall, music within. Enter Raffaelle cloak'd and mask'd. Raffaelle.
'Tis strange—a few short moments, and he dies!
He that in pride of youth and happiness,
Plumed up by beauty's smile, and trick'd in all
The trappings of his new aspiring fortunes:
He that would mate me in magnificence,
Comes but adorned with all these shining glories
As to a sacrifice; dull and unconscious
As one who sleeps beneath a tottering rock,
And dies ere ruin wake him:—I can play
The spider with true art: he is enmesh'd
Ev'n as he gambols, and my fell embrace
Poisons his life-blood:—soft—is't he?— Enter Julio. Julio.
                                         My lord. Raffaelle.
Peace on thy life, and wait for Claudio's coming. Enter Lodovico and others: Raffaelle draws back. Lodovico.
All Mantua dotes upon lord Claudio;
His very griefs have made him popular;
[Page 47]

And in magnificence I doubt he'll rival
The lord Cimaro, though I hear he to-night
Exceeds his former grandeur. 1 Gentleman.
                                         Let us in then.                                          (Exeunt.) Raffaelle.
Aye, aye, lord Claudio is their dear friend now,
He whom some two days since they would think grac'd
By half a look, they turn to him and court him;
My pleasures pall and sicken on their tastes:
[25]   'Twere folly but to dream it could be else.
Th' astronomer views not th' all-glorious sun,
That immemorial pageant of the heavens,
With half the fond delight with which he spies
The scarce seen twinklings of a new-found star:
Great things grow stale and common by oft seeing;
And, with the common herd, are scarcely felt;
Because the form, instinctive in their thoughts,
Awakes no cause for vulgar contemplation.
Yet I shall mar this pleasure—here he comes! Raffaelle stands back, Enter Claudio, Louisa and Gentlemen. Julio comes forward to Claudio. Julio.
My lord, I'd crave a moment's word with you. Claudio.
On then, my love!—on friends! I'll strait be with you.                                          (Exeunt Louisa and Gentlemen)
[Page 48]
Julio.
My lord, my master charg'd me to inform you,
He thinks to have found some traces of those men
Who bore false witness 'gainst you, at your trial. Claudio.
Then let them go unheeded—I am free
From any wish against them;—should they name
The author of my ills, I would not harm them
Let my lord know this— Julio.
Sir, I'll do your bidding                                          (Exit.) Raffaelle makes a pass at him as he is going out, which he wards with his hand—they fight— Raffaelle is disarm'd—he exits in the arch. Claudio.
Help! help!—he must be here. Enter Gentlemen with torches.
A villain ever now attacked me here—
He must have pass'd this way. 1 Gentleman.
                                         Ha! see this door;
Was't here he fled? 2 Gentleman.
[50]                                            This leads but to the court,
And no one's there. Claudio.
                                         Indeed this is most strange;
But I beseech you say no more of it,
It might affright Louisa.
[Page 49]
1 Gentleman.
                                         We will not, sir, Claudio.
Thanks! thanks! let's in, lest that my stay amaze them.                                          (Exeunt.) SCENE III. —A SALOON OPENING BY FOLDING-DOORS INTO AN ILLUMINATED GARDEN, IN WHICH FOUNTAINS ARE SEEN PLAYING, THE VIEW TERMINATED BY A RUSTIC TEMPLE OF SILVER BOUGHS ENTWINED. Gentlemen and Ladies masked,—Alphonso with others, habited in rich Arcadian dresses discovered —among these Raffaelle, similiarly habited, steals unperceived—a dance—after which Raffaelle comes forward. Raffaelle.
He'as 'scaped the lion's gripe; I'm held at bay;
But I've another effort ere I fall:
Thinks he to baffle my endeavours yet;
I am urged on by millions of desires,
And each desire hath many several hands,
To gain the full completion of my wishes:
Yet on one chance rests all my hopes—one chance!—
If it be lost, I have no care but death:
And both shall grace the glory of my ruin.
I am not fool enough to die alone:
I'll hold immortal int'rest in Louisa—
My spirit shall o'ermatch her Claudio's.
[Page 50]
Enter Claudio and Gentlemen. Claudio.
Nay, name it not; would I could find Cimaro,
He might seek out the villain—but no matter;
Do not, I pray you, interrupt the sport,
By speaking of th' attack. 2 Gentleman.
                                         We will not, sir, Raffaelle. (To Alphonso)
Our guests seem somewhat heated by the dance;
Let us fill wine to them—pour out a bowl—
For my lord Claudio. Claudio.
                                         Is it you, Cimaro?
To-morrow I will speak with you, so please you:
The ancient malice of my unknown foe
Is not e'en yet appeas'd. Raffaelle.                                          (Aside)
[25]                                            Nor will it be,
Until your life is made the atonement. How
Has he again, attempted on your life? Claudio.
Ev'n here beside your gates I was attack'd
By one, who being disarm'd fled hither. Raffaelle.
                                         Hither!
I'll search the palace. Claudio.
                                         Not so—pray you, Raffaelle;
Louisa must not know this. (Alphonso brings wine which Raffaelle takes and puts a powder into it.) Raffaelle. (To Alphonso)
My lord Manlio,
[Page 51]

I thank you, will you drink my gentle lord? (To Claudio.) Claudio.
I'm somewhat heated by this strange encounter. Raffaelle. (Laying his hand on Claudio's, which holds the cup.)
I must prepare the sights in yonder temple.
One word—beware Alphonso!— (Raffaelle passes to the back ground, and is busied with the crowd—as Claudio raises the cup to his lips, Louisa comes up.) Claudio.
I was about to taste this generous wine—
Will't please you add a sweet to it Louisa?
Your lips do breathe a blessing on the bowl,
And make it sacred to the god of love. (She sips it—He drinks it.) Louisa.
What was it that detained you, Claudio? Claudio.
'Twas but some matters that related to
The treachery of my foes, my friend Cimaro
Thinks he has found them—but no more of that— (Alphonso takes the bowl from Claudio. Claudio and Louisa walk up.) Raffaelle. (Viewing the bowl in Alphonso's hand)
Yes, he has drain'd the venom to the bottom;
[Page 52]

His minutes now are measured, strait 'twill work. Enter Julio. Julian. (To Alphonso)
My lord, will you permit me to conduct you
[50]   Into the temple—to command the changes
That wait but for your presence— Alphonso.
                                         Lead me thither, (Exeunt.) Raffaelle.
Why this is brave—all's suited to my wishes.
This is such joy—that were the fiery bolt
Of vengeance winged already 'gainst my head
I would exult in the short interim—
And it is like I shall have longer time,
For now-a-days are miracles disused,
And man creates what prodigies he will,
Without the answer of celestial portents.
See, see, already is his cheek grown pale—
His knees begin to totter—I will to him. (Meets Claudio, Louisa hanging upon Claudio's arm. During this speech many go out.) Louisa.
Claudio, you tremble; what is't, my dear Claudio? Claudio.
Nay, nothing, nothing. Louisa.
                                         And your speech is faint—
Oh, heaven! your eyes! Raffaelle.
                                         Indeed I think your fears
Are just—he is not well—a chair here quickly. (A chair is brought—Claudio sits.
[Page 53]
Louisa.
Look, look up, Claudio— Raffaelle.
                                         Soft—his eye grows fix'd;
A film grows o'er it: what a thrill was there!
Look on his quiv'ring lip! Claudio.
                                         I'm faint, my love,
And fear the grasp of death encircles me—
[75]   His icy hand weighs heavy on my heart— Raffaelle.
Oh speak not so:—here rest your head, my friend, (lifting his head)
Say but another word—have hope, dear lady. Claudio.
Louisa,—should I die,—my friend
Cimaro— (a pause—he struggles for utterance) Raffaelle.
He cannot—see—cold drops roll down his cheek;
His heart beats low and softly— Louisa.
Mercy, Heav'n! Raffaelle.
She swoons—oh bear her from this fatal place;
Feed her with hope should she revive—                                          (Exit some with Louisa) Claudio.
                                         Cimaro!
Protect Louisa—farewell—oh! (dies) Raffaelle.
                                         Great Heaven!
My friend!—dear Claudio's! gone? aye, gone for ever— (a pause.)
That goblet was I fear the fatal cause. 1 Gentleman.
The goblet that Alphonso gave, my lord?
[Page 54]
Raffaelle.
Alphonso! ha! Alphonso! 'twas lord Manlio. 2 Gentleman.
No, good my lord— (discovering himself.) I did not— Raffaelle.
                                         Cursed fate!
This was my fear;—ah me! should he be poison'd!
Heav'ns peace be with thee, my unhappy friend;
O that the wretch who did this damned act,
May feel ev'n here the poison of that chalice.
Dear Claudio! Good my friends; retire, I pray you;
It were not well to noise this in the halls.
[100]   My absence will not be remarked—Alphonso
Will take the alarm;—therefore speak not of this—
I hope he has not done't;—but if 'tis so—
I pray you now retire and close the doors,
My grief's to me companion—he is cold—                                          (Kneeling and clasping his hand.) (Exeunt Gentlemen, and close the doors.)
Yes, he is cold! the warmth of life is gone!—
'Twas kind too to commend me to Louisa:
A dying husband's words will be obey'd,
Who leaves the world upon his wedding-day;
And his request, methinks, was not so harsh.
Fond, doting, foolish Claudio! Ere I'd yield,
Ev'n in death, Louisa to another,
[Page 55]

I'd see her reeking in her ruddy gore,
And writhing in death's agony round my feet.
Men say his nature though was soft and kindly,
And what means that—that they could prey on him:
No, while I live, I live unto myself;
And seeming generosity's a part
Of the great plan: for that I pitied Claudio—
For that I feast yon tribe of empty fools;
And done for that, his death upon my soul
Weighs not the lightest flagging of the wind.
Ho! Julio! (Enter Julio.)
                                         Remove this carrion hence,
And lay it out with pomp upon a bed;
[125]   Let there be mutes, tapers, and mummery,
And store of monks, and masses, and all mourning.
Dead, I will honour him beyond all parallel:
And it is fit: he was Cimaro's rival.
Hence! put my house into a shew of grief—
Call in your fellows—let the rumour be,
Alphonso poison'd him: for me, I am
Retired to my chamber—I'll not spare
Tears or laments—then to my sweet Louisa.                                          (Exit Julio.)
For her I wear this mockery of woe—
In her my happiness will be more perfect,
Than Paris', when he bore fair Helena
[Page 56]

In jocund triumph from the Spartan shore.
He doted on a woman, and he gain'd her;
But, at my beck, wealth, love, pre-eminence,
Come crowding in confusion of delight;
My fame not merely saved without a blemish,
But greeted with the shouts of Mantua,
For generous friendship, constancy and truth.                                          (Exit.)
[Page 57]
ACT V. SCENE I. —A SALOON IN CIMARO'S PALACE, THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF WHICH THE DAY-BREAK IS DISCOVERED. Enter Raffaelle. Raffaelle.
The drowsy pall of night is drawn aside
By the fresh vigour of the jocund morn;
So yields a widow to a second love
And so Louisa strait shall greet Cimaro.
Upon these dullards, sleep lies heavy yet:
They have no wish to mock their weariness.
Methinks the lark sounds merrily this morning,
Chaunting proud Pæans through the upper air;
And my full triumph very nature hails
In gladsome aspect. I must rouse these sleepers.
Ho! here comes Julio. Enter Julio.
                                         Julio—I have much
Must be dispatch'd to-day—I trust Alphonso
Will be suspected of this last night's business,
[Page 58]

And giv'n into my guard—'tis he must bear
The hazard—so he be condemned for it
I care not if he should escape—and yet
His death were surer:—oh! these poor dull fools!
Like cards in houses built by children—one
Falls, and in tumbling strikes another down—
But such are easily built up again— (a knock without)
A knocking there! who is't? go to the door—
I have been wailing over Claudio's corpse. (Exit Julio)
Perchance the duke has news of this already;
[25]   No matter—I'm prepar'd— Re-enter Julio. Julio.
                                         A messenger
From the lady de Commenes. Raffaelle.
                                         So soon—what says she? Julio.
But that she wishes your immediate presence. Raffaelle.
What can this mean? she cannot be so fickle
To love me yet—there's something more in this;
But what care I? I have been used to meet
And out-brave danger. Say that I obey her.                                          (Exit.)
[Page 59]
SCENE II. —THE PALACE OF THE LADY DE COMMENES. Louisa and Maria discovered. Louisa on a couch. Louisa.
If it be so—and sure I think it is—
I am not sorry that I tasted of it:
In death I shall rejoin my Claudio—
It were no happiness to stay from him. Maria.
And would you, lady, die? Louisa.
                                         Oh yes, Maria,
Death is repose with Claudio; I have felt
Even from then a gradual decay;
It grows upon me in a stilly coldness;
Yet ere it reaches to my heart, Cimaro,
I trust, will come—I'd see him ere I die. Enter an Attendant. Attendant.
Madam, the lords Lodovico and Manlio
Enquire of your health. Louisa.
                                         'Tis well; I'll see them.                                          (Exit Att.)
I would have witnesses. Enter Lodovico and Manlio. Lodovico.
                                         How fare you, lady? Louisa.
Oh well beyond all hope; calm as the night;
I've slept not—yet my mind has been with angels.
Methought I saw my Claudio stretch his arm
[Page 60]

Tow'rds me from heav'n, and with sounds seraphic,
Woo me to come to him—I shall obey him. Enter Attendant. Attendant.
Madam, my lord Cimaro. Louisa.
                                         Let me see him.                                          (Exit Attendant.)
My lords, I pray you stay; I have some words
[25]   To speak; and be you witness of his answers. Enter Raffaelle. Raffaelle.
I cannot bid you a good morrow, lady;
Your hope and mine is gone; and common greetings
Sound dull, and heartless, in this wretched time. Louisa.
Aye, my good lord, and sounds from hollow hearts
Are poor indeed to me. Raffaelle.                                          (Aside)
                                         This is most strange!
And yet believe me 'tis a happiness
Unhoped for, thus to see you: I thought not
Even that mind so much above its sorrows. Louisa.
No, didst thou think that I should wail my loss;
'Tis but a parting, and we all must die.
My griefs are not of earth: should I invest
My sorrows with the pageantry of woe?
I have a hope too bright to mix with grief—
[Page 61]

Thou couldst not think that I should live, Cimaro. Raffaelle.
Live! lady. Louisa.
Live! didst thou not drug the bowl
For me as well as Claudio? Raffaelle.
                                         I! dear lady!
For thee! Louisa.
Thou canst not look like innocence,
Though thou art full of wiles, this is no time
To mask my words—I am about to die. Raffaelle.
To die! what mean you? you! you! die! die! Louisa.
[50]                                            Yes, lord;
I should not be so calm else; but the cup
That kill'd my Claudio, lent its help to me. Raffaelle.
Thou didst not drink—'twas poison! Louisa.
                                         Aye, I feel it. Raffaelle.
Foil'd! foil'd! foil'd! foil'd! damnation! Louisa.
                                         Lord Cimaro,
You put the poison there. Raffaelle.
Who saw me do't?
Yet I care not; did you drink much? no matter—
A drop were a slow death to fifty men:
But did you taste it? Louisa.
                                         Mark him, lords! my life
But quivers on my lip. Claudio, I come.
Cimaro, thou art guilty! Heav'n forgive thee;
[Page 62]

There was a strain of music, heard you not?
Soft, soft and tender, of sweet melancholy;
Nor see you there—but your's are mortal senses—
Ah Claudio—I come—I come.                                          (Dies.) Raffaelle.
Dead! deep damnation rest on all the earth!
Sweep from its face all things that dwell on it,
And people it alone with direful plagues:
I'd not kill thee, Louisa! O 'tis mockery:
Pour down your fires, rive me to the earth,
Ye dull unthinking heav'ns! why gaze you at me?
[75]   Yes, 'twas I killed him—her—all—
I have accomplish'd the decrees of fate.
You, you, you, petty spirits, move half lifeless;
And, being, are not—fools, fools, in my fortune,
Things nobler were encompass'd. Lodovico.
                                         He is mad. Raffaelle.
Mad! reptile! are all mad that tow'r above you,
And do what you daren't dream? My deeds are spent,
Idle as ether—vagrant as the wind—
Hopeless and fineless—I have done my part—
'Tis ended—all, all—here: I had one hope,
One end, one aim—the loadstar of my life—
And it is gone;—my powers are gone with it;
[Page 63]

She's dead! Oh! would that I could weep one tear;
It would allay the fever of my soul:—
How—not one drop?—it gushes from my heart;
There, there, there, there.—I'll not endure the gaze,
And taunts, and gibes, that wait upon my fortunes;
Each fool will bless himself he'as done no murder:
And who would live, when thou and all are gone!                                          (Stabs himself.)
You wonder yet—'tis much; then I'm not fall'n
Beneath myself; I yet can scorn your follies;
While fate crouch'd to me I could live; and now
Its pow'r is not so great but I can die:
This, this is well (they offer to assist him) : no, no—away, away—
[100]   I did despise you living—and my death
Is sacred to myself. Oh! (they observe him— he suppresses his agony.) ha! ha! ha!                                          (Dies.) The Curtain Falls.
[Page 64]
Back matter
EPILOGUE. (Enter Mrs. Epilogue, an old flirt, with a large fan, &c.)
Gentles good even, Mrs. Epilogue,
I introduce myself; my brother Prologue
Refused his countenance to me, the brute!
And left me thus to hazard a debut:
He is my elder brother,—or I'm sure
He'd have no reason to be so demure.
This is the way with antiquated folks;
They're past the relish of our modern jokes,
Preaching in dull blank verse!—if there's a poet
Within the pit I call on him to shew it
How much our speeches are improved by time,
Since lucky fortune cast them into rhyme.
For were't not for the jingle at the end
Some works might be thought prose—which Heav'n forefend!
Then such a fuss about instruction too,
As though his canting stead of shew would do.
For Heav'ns sake do not countenance the fellow,
Or where we rant some Methodist may bellow.
[Page 65]

A play's a play, say I, and but give me
A quantum suff : of roaring,—grief, or glee.
Who is not mov'd when Alexander's mad?
If not the scene—a head-ache makes him sad.
In Comedy what difference in the case is,
Whether we laugh at wit or Munden's faces?
A play's a vehicle for striking action;
And to bring folks together: though a faction
May hold that they should have a moral with 'em,
Some authors have no morals left to give 'em.
Plays, to gain approbation in these times,
Should be no more than speaking pantomimes:
Or if there needs a theme to talk upon,
The surest hit's to palliate crim. con.
A lady in men's clothes has great effect;
Plays that want noise you'll certainly reject;
And then when all is done, and you have wonder'd
Enough how actors fell, and jump'd, and flounder'd,
And ran against the door posts, while you thought
Soon to decide if in their heads were aught
That so in princely parts they play'd the dog;
Then let there come a sprightly Epilogue,
No matter how 'tis written,—so 'tis said,
That she who spoke 't was pretty and well-made,
'Twill catch some sure applause herself to praise,
In half a hundred pretty, clap-trap ways.
And so I told our moody author here;
But he refused such practices to bear:
“For me,” said he,—I've not forgot his speech,
“If I can wisdom, truth, and virtue teach,
[Page 66]

“And gain my own applause as well as theirs,
“The stage may claim my most exalted cares:
“But if men come but with their sensual eyes,
“I've shewn a mirror tells them how I prize
“Their vain acclaims, if so—soul, and tongue and pen
“May lie oblivious—and ne'er wake again.”

PROLOGUE. [By Peacock, E.] WRITTEN BY E. PEACOCK, ESQ.
Beyond the hopes and fears of earlier days,
The frowns of censure, and the smiles of praise,
Is he, the Bard, on whose untimely tomb,
Your favour bade the Thespian laurel bloom.
Though late the meed that crown'd his minstrel strain,
It has not died, and was not given in vain.
If now our hopes one more memorial rear,
To blend with those that live un withering here.
If on that tomb, where genius sleeps in night,
One flower expands to bloom in lingering light,
Flower of a stem which no returning spring,
Shall clothe anew with buds and blossoming.
Oh! yet again the votive wreath allow
To grace his name, which cannot bind his brow;
And while our tale the scenic maze pursues,
Still prove kind Guardians to his orphan muse.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. WAVERLY'S CHAMBER. Waverly discovered reading. Wav. Lay you here. (Lays down the book.) What enviable sculls must they have, who read law by way of recreation!—For my part, whether the fault lies in my blood or my brains, I can't determine, but I am sure there's too near a connexion between them, for me ever to make my head a lumber-room for the Statutes at Large—No, I shall never be Lord Chancellor, that's clear.
                                         (Knocking.) Enter Servant. Serv. Mr. Barton, Sir.
Enter Barton . Wav. (Aside.) Now for a common-place lecture upon dissipation and extravagance.—These old fellows, when they forget the relish of pleasure themselves, endeavour to make it nauseous to every body else.— Hah! my dear uncle! I'm heartily glad to see you in town.
Bart. That may be, Sir, tho' I don't believe a word of it; but I'm not heartily glad to see you, Sir; and I don't know, Sir, that I shall ever be heartily glad to see you again, Sir;—I have heard of your tricks, Sir!

[Page 2]
Wav. Very likely, Sir; I know I've a great many kind friends.
Bart. An't you a sad young dog, Sir?—Answer me that!—An't you a sad young dog, Sir?
Wav. [25]   Sad, Sir!—I never was in better spirits in the whole course of my life.
Bart. Instead of keeping your commons, attending the courts, and reading Blackstone, you must dangle after petticoats—play at faro with people of quality—and keep your bit of blood for the Ascot and Epsom Races!—What d'ye think, Sir, all this will come to?
Wav. More than I shall be able to pay, uncle, I'm afraid.
Bart. Prodigal!—Spendthrift!—Rake!—Beggar! —You I mean, Sir!
Wav. I beg pardon, Sir; I thought you were talking to yourself.
Bart. Hav'n't I done every thing in my power to make a man of you?—Didn't I fix you as clerk with one of the first merchants of the first city in the universe?
Wav. Yes, Sir, you did fix me there with a vengeance, where I enlarged my ideas of men and manners, by making the grand tour of the sugar-market; and improved my health and complexion, by squatting ten hours a day upon a little high stool, to acquire the accomplishments of filling up bills of lading, and copying invoices.
Bart. [50]   Well, Sir, wasn't I silly enough to take you from the counting-house and settle you in the law?
Wav. Yes, Sir, as you couldn't make me a rum puncheon or a sugar hogshead, you kindly consented to transform me into a wig-block!
Bart. A wig-block, Sir? S'death! what d'ye mean?—Hav'nt I entered you here of the Temple?
Wav. Yes, Sir; where having been properly broke, trained, nicked, cropt, and blooded, I might
[Page 3]
start for the plate in Westminster Hall: and, after being distanced the first heat, might sit quietly down in the third row of pale-faced special pleaders, like a succession plant in a green-house, waiting till the old ones drop off.
Bart. Why what do you mean, Sir?—Plant in a green-house!—Hav'n't I taken you handsome chambers? —bought you a noble library of— (Looks at the book-case.) Hey!—what the devil's become of all your books?
Wav. Gone, Sir!
Bart. Gone?
Wav. Yes, Sir; as I always pay the greatest deference to your opinion, you see I have taken the earliest opportunity of following your advice.
Bart. [75]   Following my advice, Sir?
Wav. Yes, Sir, you recommended me to enlarge my library.
Bart. Well, Sir?
Wav. So, I immediately opened a treaty with a celebrated auctioneer, and in three days they were all at liberty.
Bart. And this you call enlarging your library?
Wav. Yes, Sir; indeed they looked so melancholy in their state of confinement, that the very sight of them gave me the blue devils;—and as you know I mean to give up the business, I thought it advisable to take the earliest opportunity of parting with my stock in trade.
Bart. Yes, Sir; but I see you havn't parted with your stock of impudence.
Wav. No, Sir, that's generally the last thing a man parts with in our profession:—but, seriously, my dear sir, how could you think of confining a steed of my blood and spirit within the dull inclosures of the law?
Bart. Better, sir, than running wild like a colt about a common; and, sirrah, your coat will be soon almost as ragged.

[Page 4]
Wav. Not if you'll do me a favour, nuncle.
Bart. [100]   What is that, prodigal?
Wav. Lend me five hundred pounds.
Bart. Never, sir:—what, make me a partner in your extravagance?
Wav. Quite the reverse, my dear sir. You know I must have the money; and if I apply to my old friend Levi, fifty per cent. will be the very lowest: now, if you were to advance it me, I know you wouldn't charge me more than five at farthest. Nay, I shouldn't be at all surprised, if you were to lend it me for a year or two without any interest at all.
Bart. And what security do you propose?
Wav. Pooh! you're too much of a gentleman to talk of security:—isn't my honour a very sufficient security?
Bart. Your honour!—Yes, yes, to be sure, when you an't worth a sixpence, your honour will make a very pretty dividend among your creditors. Pray, does your old friend Levi lend you money upon your honour?
Wav. Upon my honour he does not.
Bart. And when you made over the reversion of your fortune to him, did he advance the price of it upon your honour?
Wav. No; but I shall fling him there.
Bart. [125]   What, evade the contract?
Wav. Yes, by shooting myself the day before I come of age, and have the satisfaction in my dying moments to think I have cheated a Jew.
Bart. A very pretty Christian consolation, upon my soul!—However, Sir, I see you are not to be reclaimed, and my time is too precious to be thrown away upon incorrigible folly.
Wav. 'Gad that's fortunate, my dear uncle; for I have an engagement upon my hands, which I would not break—
Bart. For any thing I suppose, but a horse-race or a party at Faro?

[Page 5]
Wav. Only walk with me to the end of the next street, and you shall be convinced I have a better scheme in my head than either a horse-race or a party at Faro.
Bart. Shew me a scheme worthy the pursuit of a man of sense, and—
Wav. You'll lend me the five hundred—hey! uncle?
                                         (Exit.) Bart. What a mixture of folly, levity, and kindheartedness. Never steady to any one point; always planning structures, and building castles in the air. What his present scheme can be, heaven knows. [150]   Still I doubt not but I shall reclaim him. But now to pay a visit to Lady Nightshade—and then for my profligate ward, Sedgemore—his detestable disease of gaming, I am almost afraid, is incurable, but my friendship for his deceased father, and my duty as his guardian, compel me to use any means in my power to retrieve his honour and preserve his estate. I have just received a letter from him, in my assumed character of Moses Levi, the Jew, wherein he informs me he is in present want of two thousand pounds, and must have it within two days.— (Reads.) —“Let me have the money.—I care not on what terms.—Money I want, and money I will have. C. Sedgemore.”—Yes, my precious ward, I will, as Moses Levi, again visit you. Advance you this money—get you in my power—punish your folly, preserve your fortune, or abandon you to folly and disgrace.
                                         (Exit.) SCENE II. —Lady Wellgrove's. Enter Lady Wellgrove , followed by Sapling . Sap. Why cousin! cousin Letty, I say, why what makes you run away from a body so?
Lady Well. Can't you see I don't like your company?

[Page 6]
Sap. What do you speak so cross to a body for?— I'm sure I'm always very civil to you, and would do any thing to oblige you; but you're always so queer and so grumptious.
Lady Well. Why, you know I've been obliged to give you up; for, in spite of all my endeavours to make you a human creature, you don't make the least progress towards civilization.
Sap. Why, you don't give me any encouragement.
Lady Well. Not give you any encouragement?— Didn't I carry you with me on Saturday night to the Opera?—and didn't you begin snoring in the middle of Cherubini's famous Bravura?
Sap. I'd a nice nap, that's the truth on't: but you know I woke time enough to encore it; and ecod, I don't see but that's as much as many of your dilli— what-d'ye-call-em?
Lady Well. Dillitanti?
Sap. Aye, Dillitanti do.
Lady Well. What, I suppose you would rather have heard the roaring of a dozen fox-hunters in your [25]   father's great hall?
Sap. No, no, I don't say that: but dash me if I wouldn't rather hear our Doll in the country call the bees together with a poker and warming a pan.
Lady Well. Didn't I take you with me to see the new Comedy?—and didn't you set up such a hideous roar of laughter, that my Lady Sarcasm asked me if I had brought you from Exeter 'Change?
Sap. Well, I went to laugh, didn't I?—and what do I care for my Lady Sarcasm, and the rest of your prim, plaistered, antiquated tabbies?—Ecod they don't mind to laugh, for fear of cracking their complexions. —Hang me, if I think there's one of them would stand a good game of romps; I should like hugely to try a few of them at Hunt the Slipper, or Hot Cockles, or Blindman's Buff.

[Page 7]
Lady Well. Oh you miracle of elegance!—Women of quality play at Hot Cockles or Blindman's Buff!
Sap. Why not?—where's the use of a woman, if she's never to move?—I'm sure the other night, at Mrs. Kickshaw's, we sat for half an hour as if all the life of the company had got into the plates and dishes; and after all, there wasn't supper enough for a couple of camelions. Lord! lord! how I did long for a good large dish of gooseberry fool!
Lady Well. [50]   Gooseberry fool!—Oh you monster!
Sap. Yes, gooseberry fool!—What makes you snub a body so?—we shouldn't cross one another before we're married; we shall have time enough for that afterwards.
Lady Well. Married!—who ever dreamt of such a thing?
Sap. Why, if you come to that, I dare say you have a hundred times.
Lady Well. Not of marrying you tho'.
Sap. Why father said you would marry me. You know he sent me to town on purpose.
Lady Well. Indeed!
Sap. Why you know he did.
Lady Well. Why, then, take my advice:—go home to father, and tell him, I have sent you back as untamable. Go, retire to your native woods; and if you are determined to marry, marry a lioness or a she elephant. Why, how could your father think it possible, that I should ever marry a creature that's more awkward than a bear, before he has learnt to dance, and as mischievous as a monkey, without being half as entertaining? There! go along! Mamma's darling, and father's own son.
                                         (Exit.) Sap. (solus.) My mamma's darling and my father's [75]   own son!—what does she mean by that?—I suppose that I'm a fool as well as father. Well—all this must be vastly polite, because she's a woman of high breeding. In the country, perhaps, we should call it rude; but in London!—Well, let her go— (snapping his fingers) that for her—I'm going to dine with some jolly
[Page 8]
boys, at one of the great coffee-houses, and if I don't drink confusion to her in a bottle of Burgundy, may I be poisoned with the first glass.—Marry her!—A fig for her!
                                         (Exit.) SCENE III. Lady Nightshade's. Enter Waverly and Betty. Betty. Hush!—Hush, Mr. Waverly, for heaven's sake tread more softly.
Wav. Where's Julia?
Betty. In her chamber, poor young lady, little dreaming of the plot they are hatching.
Wav. Who?—what plot?—
Betty. Worse than Gunpowder Treason—it will make your very hair stand on end.
Wav. Does it concern Miss Sedgemore?
Betty. You shall hear:—You must know I have long suspected my Lady and Lord Filligree; I thought their midnight confabulations would end in something; so knowing they were alone together just now in the drawing-room, I stole gently up the back stairs, into the next chamber, and look'd thro' the key-hole: —Great discoveries, you know, have been made by looking thro' a key-hole.
Wav. Well, what did you see?
Betty. Nothing, Sir, but I heard a great deal.
Wav. Well, what was it about?
Betty. Why I won't pretend to repeat exactly the words, but they talked a great deal about a Faro table, and five thousand pounds, and then your name was mentioned, and my sweet young lady's, and [25]   something about a foolish attachment, and that it must never be, and rustic bashfulness, and overcoming her scruples, and then I heard his lordship say something about a private lodging.
Wav. Ay, are you sure of that?

[Page 9]
Betty. Very sure, Sir, I couldn't distinctly hear where, but I know it was in one of the streets leading out of one of the squares.
Wav. So, so, well what followed?
Betty. That was all I heard, for as I was turning my head round to put my other ear to the key-hole, I fell a-sneezing: so I was obliged to put my handkerchief into my mouth, and steal softly down stairs.
Wav. Are they still alone together?
Betty. No doubt they are, Sir, contriving the ruin of the poor innocent.—I declare the very thought of it almost turns me topsy turvy.
Wav. You must immediately convey me into the room where you heard this conversation.
Betty. Why to be sure I could, but if I was to be found out and lose my place.
Wav. Well, well, if you should, I'll get you another.
Betty. Perhaps, Sir, when you marry my lady, you may take me into your service?
Wav. Ay, ay, any thing.
Betty. [50]   This way then, Sir, softly, this way, Sir.
                                         (Exeunt.) SCENE IV. ANOTHER ROOM IN LADY NIGHTSHADE'S HOUSE. Her Ladyship and Lord Filligree at a table. L. Fil. Positively your ladyship is right—I'm afraid I shall never be able to prevail upon the dear girl.
Lady Night. Never depend upon it. This Waverly has quite turned her brain:—and tho' I have forbid him my house, I have lately discovered them carrying on a clandestine correspondence.
L. Fil. Yes, she certainly encourages his addresses, and repels mine; tho' positively, her indifference
[Page 10]
to me is totally unaccountable:—her education, indeed, has been very confined, and she has never been used to the addresses of persons of a certain rank.
Lady Night. And then you know, my lord, by living out of the great world, she has imbibed such antediluvian notions of honor and disinterested love, and mutual attachment. I wonder, for my part where she has picked up such a parcel of low trumpery stuff.
L. Fil. To do your ladyship justice, she has learnt none of it from you.
Lady Night. No, thank heaven!—I have nothing of that kind to answer for:—but as your lordship cannot take the town by a regular siege, what do you think [25]   of attempting it by a coup-de-main?
L. Fil. Your ladyship talks like a true campaigner, but before we take possession of the citadel, suppose we settle the division of the spoils?—Miss Sedgemore's fortune, I understand from your ladyship, is forty thousand pounds.
Lady Night. Within a few hundreds.
L. Fil. Out of which, if I marry the lady, you are to receive five thousand pounds, as a recompence for your good offices.
Lady Night. Nothing less will set up my table for the winter, in which you know your lordship is to have a share—but against my ward's inclination, I insist, no violence.—
L. Fil. Violence!—Look at me!—Do yton hink I would offer violence to a young lady?
Lady Night. No—that I'm sure your Lordship is incapable of.—Hark!—I hear her coming,—Now, make the most of your time, my lord, to prefer your suit, and, remember, a woman can refuse a man nothing when her reputation is in his power.
Enter Miss Sedgemore . Lady Night. Good morning, Julia, you look quite
[Page 11]
bewitching to-day. No doubt you heard his Lordship was here, and determined to confirm your conquest.
L. Fil. And eternally rivet a heart already devoted [50]   to your beauty.
Miss S. I can assure your Lordship, whatever the effect has been, I had no such intention.
Lady Night. Come, Julia, this is affectation. You cannot be ignorant of his Lordship's attachment, tho' you seem determined not to reward it:—however, I shall leave him to be his own advocate, and only hint, that when a man of his rank, condescends to address a person of yours, she must want both sense and spirit to reject his proposals.
                                         (Exit.) L. Fil. My dear Miss Sedgemore, what your aunt says is very true; and positively I cannot help expressing my amazement, that a person of your penetration cannot distinguish betwixt the honor of such an alliance as mine, and the paltry offers of plebeian insignificance. Positively you won't every day meet with such proposals.
Miss S. I hope not, my lord; for then I should be exposed to the daily mortification of rejecting them: but as I find my presence will only subject me to the renewal of offers, which I have already thought it my duty to refuse, I hope your Lordship will pardon my withdrawing.
L. Fil. Not so fast, my pretty little icicle, not so fast, if you please.
Miss S. What means your Lordship?
L. Fil. [75]   Mean, my charmer?—why, I mean to —to—deuce take me, if I know precisely what I mean to do;—but I certainly don't mean to let you escape, without knowing if those lips are as cold as the chilling words they breathe.
Miss S. If your Lordship attempts rudeness, I shall alarm the family.
L. Fil. Don't be afraid of that, there's nobody within hearing.
Miss S. What, then, am I betray'd?
L. Fil. Only to your happiness. (Seizes her.) In
[Page 12]
vain those frowning eyes reprove my love, for thus I dare their malice and court their persecution.
Miss S. Help!—Ruin!—Help!—Unhand me!
(Whilst they struggle, Waverly comes forward.) Wav. Ha! a cry for help!
L. Fil. Ha!—Waverly, what, are you there?—I thought, young man, you were amusing yourself with Coke upon Lyttleton.
Wav. I thank your Lordship for having assigned me a nobler task, that of rescuing virtue, beauty, and innocence from the artifices of a villain.
L. Fil. Very heroic, upon my soul; but do you recollect, Sir, who I am?
Wav. How should I, when you have forgot yourself —the best mode of reminding me of your rank is [100]   by the superiority of your conduct.
L. Fil. Let me advise you, young man, to give up the law.—You've too much morality by half; and are, indeed, as totally ignorant of the laws of gallantry.
Wav. As your Lordship is of those of honor—but if your lordship continues any longer to shock this lady by your presence, whom you have already so grossly insulted by your villainy; your Lordship will need a stronger protector than either your birth or fortune.
L. Fil. You are a most impudent fellow, positively; but take care what you are about: for if you utter the smallest monosyllable that can be construed into a challenge; by all the privileges of a peer, I'll bring you upon your knees before the upper house. I will, by all the dignity of parliament.
                                         (Exit.) Wav. My dearest Julia!—
Miss S. Oh, Charles! didn't I forbid this interview —yet how can I chide a disobedience, which has thus preserved me from insult?
Wav. From insult indeed! I have a story to tell you; but this is no time. You must immediately fly this detested house.

[Page 13]
Miss S. Whither can I fly?—What is it agitates you thus?
Wav. [125]   No matter where: fly this instant, I conjure you. Your friend Lady Wellgrove will receive you. I know the sincerity of her friendship.
Miss S. What can I do?
Wav. This is no time to hesitate—trust yourself, my sweet Julia, to my protection, and I will convey you to her.
Miss S. There's my hand, then; to your protection I resign myself.
Wav. Come, then, my sweet girl, every moment is precious.
                                         (Exeunt.)

END OF ACT I.

[Page 14]
ACT II. SCENE I. Lady Wellgrove's House. Lady Wellgrove leading in Miss Sedgemore . Lady Well. This way, my sweet girl, this room leads to my apartment, there you may remain without the least danger of discovery.
Miss S. My noble, generous friend.
Lady Well. To prevent the possibility of a surprise, take this key—it fastens the door on the inside, and will preclude all unwelcome visitors; and pray calm your agitated spirits.
Miss S. There was one thing I forgot to mention to Mr. Waverly, which was, to request that he would by no means at present inform my brother of the place of my retreat.
Lady Well. And why not?
Miss S. Oh Letitia, you know the impetuosity of his temper, and 'till every thing can be properly explained, I shall never be able to meet him.
Lady Well. But how shall we inform Waverly?
Miss S. There's the difficulty.
Lady Well. None in the least—I'll go to him myself.
Miss S. What, visit a young man in his chambers?
Lady Well. Why I hope you would not have me visit an old one.
Miss S. Yes, but in the broad day.
Lady Well. Why is not that better than doing it at [25]   night?—I'll go positively—that is, if you'll promise not to be jealous; you may depend upon my visit being a short one.—But first I must lock you up, to
[Page 15]
prevent any more elopements. Come this way, I'm your guardian now, and mean to keep you in excellent order; there— (Locks her in, and returns.) Visit a young man at his chambers?—And why not?—Virtue feels no alarm at the step;—but what says reputation? —For in these sort of fiery ordeals, though virtue escapes burning, reputation often gets terribly scorched; for let friendship move ever so fast in the cause of humanity, scandal will overtake her.
                                         (Exit.) SCENE II. Lady Nightshade's . Enter Barton and a Servant. Bart. You will be so good as inform her ladyship my name is Barton.
Serv. Barton, Sir?
Bart. Yes, Sir, Barton. (Exit Servant.) So, so, so—every thing here wears the appearance of speedy ruin. Her ladyship, I hear, as the last resource to support her sinking credit, has opened a faro table— that is, keeps a decoy for the young wild fowl of fashion; and though she has too much pride to retrench one superfluous luxury, is not ashamed to be supported by voluntary contributions of the thoughtless and the unprincipled,—a striking example of the meanness of the proud, and the littleness of the great.
Enter Lady Nightshade . Lady Night. Mr. Barton, your servant, I beg pardon for having kept you so long waiting.
Bart. No apologies, I intreat. You no doubt received my letter, apprizing you of my intentions to be in town this day?
Lady Night. Oh yes, I've been expecting you every hour.

[Page 16]
Bart. You know our lovely ward has been the principal cause of my journey, as she will be of age on Wednesday. I am come up for the purpose of delivering her fortune into her own hands, and discharging [25]   both your ladyship and myself from the trust.— Her father, you know, left her twenty thousand pounds, which, during her minority, is increased almost to thirty thousand.
Lady Night. A prodigious sum to commit to the uncontroled disposal of an inexperienced young girl.
Bart. Why it is a great sum to be sure; but I have the firmest dependance upon her prudence and discretion.
Lady Night. You will perhaps be inclined to alter your opinion—when I inform you, she this morning withdrew herself from my protection.
Bart. You astonish me!—In what manner?
Lady Night. Eloped with Mr. Waverly.
Bart. (Aside.) So, so, this was his scheme—but what reason could she have for such a proceeding?
Lady Night. That I am totally at a loss to guess.
Bart. There must be something more in this.
                                         (Aside) Lady Night. I assure you the affair has given me very great uneasiness—I have been turning it over a great deal in my mind.
Bart. And what is the result of your ladyship's contemplations?
Lady Night. I can't help thinking it would be the height of imprudence to put her into the immediate [50]   possession of her whole fortune;—if she should fall into the hands of some ruin'd spendthrift, or designing fortune-hunter, I should never forgive myself.
Bart. Amiable solicitude! (aside.)
Lady Night. I know from experience the temptations to which a young woman is exposed in this dissolute age.
Bart. No doubt your ladyship does.
Lady Night. Yes, and the difficulty of resisting them.

[Page 17]
Bart. That I believe you have sometimes found impossible. (Aside.)
Lady Night. Therefore I have been thinking, if you were to leave three or four thousand in my hands, by way of a dernier resort in case of the worst.
Bart. An excellent thought!
Lady Night. Do you approve of it?
Bart. Extremely—but why confine yourself to three or four thousand?—Don't you think ten thousand would be a neater sum?
Lady Night. Excellent! (aside.) Why if you really are of that opinion.
Bart. Oh, I think you may just as well take ten as one.
Lady Night. You shall have my bond for the payment.
Bart. Totally unnecessary; your ladyship's word [75]   is just as good: and I suppose if the faro season should prove profitable, your ladyship will be ready with the money.
Lady Night. The very first lucky run.
Bart. Now an't you a pretty devil?
Lady Night. Hey! what! amazement!
Bart. An't you a pretty devil? you old decoy duck!
Lady Night. This in my own house!
Bart. Shame! Shame! Shame!—There's not a drop of blood in your body, but should start into your face, to make some atonement for a proposal so scandalous.
Lady Night. Why, can I believe my ears?—But what else could I expect for having condescended to act in a trust with a pettifogging attorney?
Bart. Your ladyship's condescension was always great, but it is more particularly so on the present occasion—from its being so disinterested; but why should we differ in words, when we perfectly agree in sentiment; for I am quite of your ladyship's opinion, that Miss Sedgemore is in no small danger of having
[Page 18]
her fortune preyed upon by some ruin'd spendthrift, or designing fortune-hunter—and I shall be particularly cautious that no part of it shall be punted away [100]   among black-leg lords, and bankrupt women of quality.
Enter Mr. Sedgemore . Mr. S. What, Barton and my aunt in private confabulation?
Lady Night. Yes; we have been transacting a little business.—Any news of your sister?
Mr. S. None—I have been to Waverly's chambers; but he went out early this morning, and his servant can give no account of him.
Lady Night. Then, depend upon it, he's gone off with her.
Mr. S. I can't believe it.
Bart. Now I can—for he told me this morning he had a scheme in his head, tho' I couldn't get from him what it was.
Mr. S. Indeed!—That looks suspicious.
Lady Night. Oh, it puts it beyond a doubt.
Mr. S. However, I have three words to say to Barton, and then I'll renew my search.
Lady Night. As you have business, I'll leave you together.—Indeed this affair has so deranged my sensibility, that I'm not fit company for any body. Heigho!
                                         (Exit.) Bart. Tender-hearted creature!
Mr. S. Well Barton, have you seen the Jew?
Bart. He'll be here within these two hours.
Mr. S. [125]   And bring the money?
Bart. If he can procure it.
Mr. S. That's well. Have you given orders for the timber to be cut?
Bart. I have obeyed your instructions. But, my dear Sir, reflect a moment before you cut down these venerable memorials of your ancestors.

[Page 19]
Mr. S. Why what the devil else did my ancestors plant them for, but to be cut down?
Bart. At least, Sir, spare some of the old oaks.
Mr. S. Oh yes, I'll spare them all—to any body that will give a good price for them. Look'e Barton, the money I must have—I'm bound in honor to pay it, and not a tree shall be left standing.
Bart. Not one, Sir?
Mr. S. Not a sapling.
Bart. Leave one standing, Sir.
Mr. S. Not a leaf.
Bart. Only one, Sir—one solitary remnant—that having wasted the patrimony of your ancestors, you may hang yourself upon it.
Mr. S. You grow impertinent, Sir—You presume on your friendship with my father, or perhaps from being a creditor on my estate.
Bart. Your father did indeed consider me as his [150]   friend; whilst living, he honor'd me with his confidence, and when he died, (excuse these foolish tears,) appointed me the guardian of his children: 'tis a great and important trust, young man, and I shall faithfully discharge it.—Therefore, by the memory of that revered name, who gave you being, I adjure you, sacrifice not your honour and your noble spirit to the miserable pursuit of gaming, which in the selfish feelings of avarice, destroys the social energies of friendship, and the warmest feelings of the heart.
Mr. S. Well, well—excuse my impatience, I did not mean to offend you. I must preserve the dignity of my rank, and the pride of my ancestors.
Bart. Rather part with the pride of your ancestors, that you may preserve their dignity; and consider how much more noble is the humility, which makes the honest heart feel proud—than the pride which must one day end in beggary. But I see the subject is displeasing to you, and will take my leave. Whatever may be your opinion of me, you will one day know me for your friend.
                                         (Exit.)
[Page 20]
(Alone.) Mr. S. My friend! Yes, my only friend. One who nobly dares to tell me of my faults, and shews me the precipice on which I totter. Why, what a pitiful vice is this! Where the certain consequence of [175]   miscarriage is ruin and despair—and even the exultation of success is built on the misery of our fellow creatures. To recede now is, I fear, impracticable, yet something must be done, and speedily, for it will be impossible any longer to silence the clamours of my creditors, with promises which cannot be fulfilled.
Enter Mr. Hint . Hint. Beg ten thousand pardons, but was informed my Lady Nightshade was here.
Mr. S. No, Sir; her Ladyship has some time left the room.
Hint. Beg pardon, Sir; but perhaps, you may have heard of the elopement?
Mr. S. Very possibly, Sir.—Who is this impertinent puppy? (Aside.)
Hint. Beg pardon, Sir; but perhaps are acquainted with the particulars?
Mr. S. No, Sir; tho' very much interested in the event, I know very little of the particulars.
Hint. Interested in the event, and not know the particulars?—Amazing!—Now I, who don't care three farthings about the event, have a wonderful curiosity to know the particulars.
Mr. S. Such a curiosity is very wonderful indeed!
Hint. Perfectly natural tho'; just sat down to the public breakfast at my Lady Gusto's, when in rush'd [200]   my Lady Labyrinth and Mrs. Garnish, quite out of breath, like a couple of Treasury messengers. You are acquainted with my Lady Labyrinth no doubt?
Mr. S. Never heard of her, Sir. (Impatiently.)
Hint. Never heard of my Lady Labyrinth! One of the best sort of women in the world, only
[Page 21]
very unfortunate in telling a story—dash'd into it notwithstanding, and indeed would have been tolerably correct, hadn't she been totally mistaken in time, place, and circumstance. However, Mrs. Garnish made amends—know Mrs. Garnish, I presume?
Mr. S. Never heard of her either, Sir.
Hint. The best story-teller in England—great in a duel—excellent in a divorce—but in an elopement superlative.—To be sure, she does embroider a little, but then her manner is perfectly inimitable.
Mr. S. Indeed, Sir.
Hint. Kept us in such a constant roar, that I began to tremble for the consequences. My lady Stucco was seized with such a convulsion of laughter, that she crack'd one of her cheeks in the explosion, and shewed part of her face for the first time these twenty years.
Mr. S. Then, Sir, I presume you are acquainted [225]   with the whole circumstances.
Hint. All of them mistaken tho'. One said it was the Italian music-master, a second the Irish footman, a third the Swiss valet; nay, Mrs. Neverout maintained to the last, it was Robin the gardener, and that the parties were seen together precisely at thirty-five minutes and a quarter past five this morning, riding double on one of the dock-tailed coach-horses thro' Kensington turnpike. All of them wrong —know nothing about it.
Mr. S. Then, Sir, most probably you do.
Hint. Wants to pump me. (aside.) Who, I? Oh no, Sir; not an iota— (affectedly) I know nothing— am not fit to be trusted. The ladies to be sure never place any confidence in me—I never know the motto of their garters, or the colour of their bed-furniture— No, Dam'me, I'm a dull dog—hav'n't the art of penetrating into mysteries, of diving into the bottom of things—Miss may be a perfect vestal, for any thing I know to the contrary.

[Page 22]
Mr. S. Who dares say otherwise? (hastily.)
Hint. Not I, Sir—I say no such thing—But if a young lady, forgetting the usual decorum of her sex, does choose to appear at the chamber-window of a young fellow—
Mr. S. [250]   Well, Sir?
Hint. A handsome young fellow, a gay young fellow, a wild young fellow.
Mr. S. Has Miss Sedgemore done this, Sir?
Hint. Who says she has, Sir?—who mentioned Miss Sedgemore?—Zounds, Sir, d'ye think I can't keep a secret?
Mr. S. Oh, Sir, I haven't the least doubt upon that subject.
Hint. Certainly wants to pump me, but it won't do. (Aside.) I say, Sir, if a young lady, who has something like a reputation to lose, does choose to appear at the window of a young fellow, the most charitable construction upon her conduct—
Mr. S. Well, Sir?
Hint. Will be, that it is not very correct. To be sure, Waverly is my friend.
Mr. S. Waverly, Sir?
Hint. No, Sir, who mentioned Waverly?—Not my practice upon these occasions to mention names —If he had run away with the whole of the Grand Signor's Seraglio, what's that to me?—Let every man attend to his own business, that's my way.
Mr. S. Then Waverly is a villain! (aside.)
Hint. Looks devilish blank upon it. (aside.)
Mr. S. [275]   Thoughtless, foolish girl!
Hint. Beg pardon, Sir, but know the lady perhaps?
Mr. S. Intimately, Sir.
Hint. Beg pardon, Sir, but love her perhaps.
Mr. S. To distraction!
Hint. Beg pardon, Sir, but jilted perhaps?—Take my advice and give her up.
Mr. S. Give up whom, Sir? (angrily.)

[Page 23]
Hint. Nobody, Sir. I don't advise you to do any such thing.
Mr. S. Heark'e, Sir, if you breathe the slightest imputation on the virtue of Miss Sedgemore, it will be at the hazard of your life.
                                         (Exit.) Hint , Solus. Hint. Ti, ti, ti, tum—Ti, ti, ti, ti. A mighty queer genius this!—designed for the church, I suppose —not dock'd yet tho'—thinks he's in the pulpit already —sha'n't bully me tho'—In love with her to distraction—don't let me forget that.
Enter Robert . Robt. My lady, Sir, is so much indisposed, that she'll not be able to see you this morning.
Hint. Not see me this morning?—this fellow must know something about it. Hist, hist, Robert—come here, Robert. Isn't your name, Robert?
Robt. Bob, Sir—tho' some for shortness call me Robert.
Hint. You've liv'd a long while in the family, Robert?
Robt. [300]   Twelve years last Lammas, your honor.
Hint. A very long service. A great favourite of your lady's, I know. I have heard her praise your superior style of polishing plate, and cleaning decanters —deep in the secrets of the family—Eh, Robert? Dare say you know all the particulars of the elopement.
Robt. Elopement, Sir?
Hint. Bound to secrecy, I see! (aside) Come, come, you need not be so confounded close with me —your young Mistress's elopement—
Robt. Haven't heard a syllable of it.
Hint. Not heard of it! Why, is it possible you have been blind, deaf, and dumb, upon such an occasion?
Robt. Lord bless you, the servant that can't upon
[Page 24]
occasions be blind, deaf, and dumb, will never live long in a great family.
Hint. Very true; but tell me all you know about it—tell me all you know, and, you dog, I'll make an exciseman of you.
Robt. If you would make me an emperor, I could tell you nothing.
Hint. No?
Robt. Not a syllable.
Hint. Why, then, get thy ways for an uninquisitive blockhead! and the next time you say your [325]   prayers, don't forget to beg for a little more curiosity. (Pushes him out.) What strange creatures there are in this world! Dare say this fellow never troubles his head about any body's business but his own. If I could have picked up two or three incidents, with the help of a little embellishment, I might have done wonders; but to be obliged entirely to depend on one's own invention, is rather too hard—besides it may bring me into a scrape—for tho' all the world knows I wont fight, for that very reason I shall be sure to be challenged.
                                         (Exit.)

END OF ACT II.

[Page 25]
ACT III. SCENE I. Waverly's Chambers. Enter Waverly followed by a Servant. Pen, Ink, and Papers, on Table. Wav. Mr. Sedgemore called you say?
Serv. Yes, Sir.
Wav. Did he leave no message, or letter?
Serv. None at all, Sir.
                                         (Knocking at door.) Wav. See who knocks.— (Exit Serv. —Strange what he could want with me so early.
Enter Servant. Serv. A lady in a veil, Sir, wishes to speak with you.
Wav. Shew her in, Sir.— (Exit Serv.) —Who the devil can this be?—in a veil too.— Enter Servant, introducing Lady Wellgrove . You may retire, Sir.
                                         (To Servant, who goes out.) Lady Well. Are we alone?
Wav. As Adam and Eve were in Paradise, Madam.
Lady Well. (Unveils.) But are you sure there is no serpent here in disguise?
Wav. Lady Wellgrove!
Lady Well. You are visibly surprised, Mr. Waverly, at the imprudence of this visit; but when you hear it is made on the behalf of Miss Sedgemore, your candour will, I trust, excuse this sacrifice to propriety.

[Page 26]
Wav. The wishes of Miss Sedgemore could receive no additional influence, except in being communicated from so fair a messenger.
Lady Well. Very gallant, indeed, but to the point. [25]   —Her brother is yet unacquainted with her escape, in which you have so generously assisted, and as she dreads the impetuosity of his temper, I must have your promise, not to reveal to him, for the present at least, the place of her retreat.—May I promise her your silence?
Wav. Certainly.
Lady Well. Having executed my commission, you will pardon the abruptness of my visit.— (As she is going.)
Enter Servant. Ser. Mr. Sedgemore, Sir.
Wav. The devil!—Say I'm not at home.
Serv. I've already told him you are, Sir.
Lady Well. What will become of me?
Wav. Fool! dolt! idiot!— (To Servant, who goes out.) —Step into this room, Madam, a minute, and depend upon my protection.
As he is putting her into the room, enter Sedgemore . Sedg. So, so, so, as I suspected!—I wonder what face he will put upon the affair. (Aside).
Wav. Ah, Charles Sedgemore!—the very man I was longing to see— (aside.) Wish you was fifty miles off, with all my heart and soul.—How long have you been in town? You found the roads very dirty I suppose.—What the devil shall I say to him? — (aside).
Sedg. His confusion is manifest— (aside).
Wav. [50]   Faith, Charles, I'm most heartily glad to see you.
Sedg. You will give me leave to doubt that, Sir.— By the glimpse of a petticoat, I caught just now, I
[Page 27]
suspect my visit is as unwelcome, as it was unexpected.
Wav. What, then, you had a glimpse, eh?
Sedg. Yes, Sir, I had a glimpse.
Wav. How the devil shall I get off now?— (aside). Well, well, as you see how the land lies, I know you've more charity than to interrupt my happiness.— Who do you think it is?—You won't believe me, if I tell you.
Sedg. Perhaps not, Sir.
Wav. Mistress to the Spanish ambassador.
Sedg. Indeed? His impudence amazes me— (aside).
Wav. Yes, she now and then pays me a charitable visit.—I'd introduce you, but she's a lady of very nice reputation, and talks the prettiest broken English—
Sedg. Most probably I shall take the liberty of introducing myself.
Wav. Why, that will be taking a very unaccountable liberty indeed.
Sedg. One, however, that I shall think myself warranted in doing.
Wav. [75]   Why then, you'll excuse me for hinting, that no gentleman ever presses his company, where he finds it is not agreeable.
Sedg. For that very reason, Sir, I shall intrude mine.— (Sits down in a chair.)
Wav. Why this is very civil, very civil, upon my soul.—Why then, Sir, I must take the liberty of reminding you that these apartments are mine.
Sedg. Granted, Sir.
Wav. That every thing in them belongs to me.
Sedg. (Rising.) Are you sure of that, Sir?
Wav. Yes, Sir, fixtures and moveables.
Sedg. Except the lady in the next room, Sir.
Wav. Why, you know, I don't pretend to an entirety in her.

[Page 28]
Sedg. Then, Sir, I do, and thus I take possession.— (Attempts to go into the room.)
Wav. By heavens, you pass not here!
Sedg. Sir,—let the lady make her appearance and answer for herself.
Wav. Whoever the lady is, Sir, it is sufficient for me to know, as it ought to be for you, that she has put herself under my protection.
Sedg. Then, Sir, I will no longer be trifled with.
Wav. Nor I intimidated.
(They struggle, and Lady Wellgrove enters.) Sedg. [100]   Lady Wellgrove! amazement!
Wav. Now, Sir, I hope you are satisfied.
Lady Well. Mr. Sedgemore, I can assure you, however appearances may be against me.—I say, Sir, however extraordinary it may appear that—I mean, that notwithstanding the natural inference—
Sedg. The lady talks very pretty broken English, indeed.
Lady Well. Indeed, Charles, you are in an error.— (Cries.)
Wav. You are upon my soul, Charles.
Sedg. No, Madam, I have been in an error too long, am now undeceived—that I have lov'd you with the most ardent affection, it is now as much my shame and regret, as it was once my pride and boast. —However, it is never too late to amend our errors, and I shall, I trust, expiate the magnitude of my folly, by the sincerity of my repentance.—As to you, Sir, (to Waverly ) for this aggravated insult to my feelings, I shall expect speedy retribution.
                                         (Exit.) Wav. (After a pause.) Was there ever such an unlucky accident?—Sure all the devils in pandemonium have been laying their heads together to bring it about.
Lady Well. Oh, Mr. Waverly, how frail and tender [125]   a blossom is woman's reputation, which not only fades under the slightest breath of merited reproach;
[Page 29]
but whilst employed in the cause of humanity, incautiously nourishes the worm which feeds upon its quiet.—How ought guilt to tremble, when indiscretion is punished so severely.
                                         (Exit.) Wav. So, I am likely to have a day of adventures —a jobation from my uncle—an elopement with one lady, and a tete-a-tete with another—for which I suppose I shall get my throat cut before night.
Enter Servant. Serv. (Gives a letter.) The messenger waits for an answer.
Wav. From Mr. Sedgemore, I suppose. (Reads.) “Sir, I write this from the nearest Coffee-house, to inform you, I shall be at the Ring, in Hyde-Park, within an hour, when and where I expect you will give satisfaction, to the much injured Charles Sedgemore.” —Within an hour?—why that's allowing very little breathing time, but when a man is thoroughly determined to do a rash action, the less time he takes to consider of it the better.—How am I to proceed in this affair? Must I give him the meeting?—certainly, there is no avoiding it.—Get me ink and paper, Sir. (Sits.) Shall I fight with him? Wherefore? —Have I done him an injury?—No.—Have I [150]   received one from him?—Yes,—but I can forgive it— why then should I risk my own life, or endanger his?— Because, otherwise the world will post me for a coward, and I am afraid of its reproaches.—Afraid of its reproaches? What then, shall I be a coward in reality, to avoid the mere imputation of it?—I must give him the meeting however. (Writes.) Here, Sir, give this to the messenger who waits, and this you must immediately run with to Mr. Hint's, if he should be out, get intelligence where he is, and follow him. (Exit Servant.) If the lady had really been inclined to do me a favour, I could have been run through the body for her with the utmost satisfaction,
[Page 30]
but to suffer so heavy a penance for a sin I never committed, is a little beyond my philosophy.

My greatest glory and my pride would be,
Freely to die for her who lives for me;
But she who lives to bless another's arms,—
Why let another combat for her charms.                                          (Exit Waverly .) SCENE II. LADY NIGHTSHADE'S. Table, Pen, Ink, Paper, and Chairs. Enter Mr. Sedgemore with a letter. Sedg. What am I to think of this letter.—It certainly never could be intended for me (reads.) “Dear Hint, by a strange fatality of events, I am summoned to meet my dearest friend, in an affair of honour, whose sister I have preserved from the most imminent ruin—I have also involved in my disgrace a virtuous and innocent lady, who, from motives of the purest friendship, has been tempted to exercise her humanity at the peril of her reputation” —directed “Charles Sedgemore, Esq.”—Is it possible! I have been too hasty in my suspicions —I know not what to think—perhaps—
Enter Barton , disguised as Levi . Bart. I ax pardon for disturbing you, but business —business you know—
Sedg. Must be attended to—therefore in three words, can you let me have the two thousand pounds?
Bart. Two thousand pounds!
Sedg. Yes—I must have it directly.
Bart. Directly, that ish very short notish.
Sedg. Shall I have it?
Bart. Two thousand pounds!—
Sedg. What say you?

[Page 31]
Bart. Moneysh is very scarce—times are hard.
Sedg. What, at your old tricks, friend Levi. [25]   Come, come, I understand you, all this is as much as to say, you must have 20 per cent.
Bart. Twenty per cent! bless your soul, d'ye think I steal de moneysh—I could'nt do the business under fifty, 'pon my life.
Sedg. Fifty per cent., well, you shall have it.
Bart. And fifty pounds premium.
Sedg. You shall have it.
Bart. Vel, I vil try what I can do—I vil try what I can do—and now we have settled that, supposhe we talk a little about the security.
Sedg. A mortgage on my whole terra firma.
Bart. No, dat ish already mortgaged to Mr. Barton, your steward.
Sedg. Egad, that's true—how the devil should he know that (aside.) However, I'm going to clear away the old rubbish from the premises—to sweep off the antiquated oaks and elms, and you shall have a mortgage upon them, either standing or lying, as you please.
Bart. Your old elms and your old oaks will be a very rotten security—cause you haven't the power of cutting till you come of age.
Sedg. Where the devil did he learn that (aside.) Well, well, that you know will be in a week.
Bart. Yesh, but you want to touch directly.
Sedg. [50]   Well, well, get me the money, and damn the security.
Bart. Damn de security—ah! dat's very pretty talking—but I can't do business without security—if its vonce known, I should be expelled, and thrown upon the vide vorld.
Sedg. Well then, you shall be the first, and set a noble example to your brother usurers.
Bart. I should not be able to convert any one of my tribe, or your's either.
Sedg. And you won't let me have the money.
Bart. Not without security.

[Page 32]
Sedg. Well—what am I to sign—are you prepared with your instruments?—I'm ready.
Bart. Oh yes! I have every thing prepared— here's de moneysh—There's the bond—it only wants your signature—Oh—I'm a man of business.
Sedg. (Signs.) There— (gives the bond.)
Bart. Well—dere— (gives the money.)
Sedg. And now go to the devil.
Bart. Thank you, Sir—much oblig'd to you— now, profligate, your punishment's at hand.
                                         (Exit Barton .) Sedg. What a miserable reptile is this—yet how can I expect that a wretch, whose trade is extortion, will lend me two thousand pounds without security, [75]   when my very best friends can't muster among them a single guinea—well, well, the errand I am going upon, may perhaps discharge a debt, which will free me at once from the importunity of my creditors, and the perfidy of my friends. If I fall, I shall be indebted to the hand of my adversary—if I survive, I must then trust to my own.
SCENE III. ANOTHER APARTMENT IN LADY NIGHTSHADE'S HOUSE. Table and Chairs. Enter Barton (as the Jew, followed by Betty). Betty. This way, Mr. Jew, if you please, this way, if you'll sit down in this room, my lady will wait on you.—I'll inform my lady.
                                         (Exit Betty.) Bart. Her ladyship want me? then there is some mischief on foot, ecod I shall make more discoveries in this disguise, than I at first calculated upon—here she comes—now to my character.
Enter Lady Nightshade . Lady Night. Your servant, Sir.

[Page 33]
Bart. No, madam, 'tis I am your ladyship's servant.
Lady Night. No ceremony, I insist upon it, pray be seated.—I have business of some importance to transact, which, as I have heard a very great character both of your talents and secrecy, I don't think I can commit into better hands.
Bart. As to my talents I shall not say nothing— as to my secrecy, I am very often employed by ladies of the first quality.
Lady Night. Then, Sir, the business is this—there are in this case diamonds of considerable value—look at them, and examine them with attention.
Bart. My ward's diamonds, by heaven! (aside.)
Lady Night. Bless me, Sir, you seem very much surprized.
Bart. [25]   I am struck with the beauty of the jewels; madam.—They are pretty baubles, very pretty baubles.
Lady Night. Yes, they cost a very pretty price, five thousand pounds I can assure you, was the very lowest.
Bart. Oh, I am sure of dat—for I bought them myself. (Aside.)
Lady Night. Examine them with the most scrupulous nicety, and tell me candidly whether you think they could be counterfeited.
Bart. Counterfeited, counterfeited, madam! (turns to Lady Nightshade .)
Lady Night. Yes, Sir, counterfeited—I have some thoughts of disposing of them.
Bart. They then belong to your ladyship?
Lady Night. Yes, a present from my poor deceased lord.
Bart. I shall never contain myself, (aside) —and your ladyship thinks of employing me in the affair.
Lady Night. Why I think you'll do me justice.
Bart. Your ladyship may depend upon the strictest justice.

[Page 34]
Lady Night. Diamonds are an ornament to be sure —but then they are of no real use.
Bart. None in the leasht—none in the leasht.—
Lady Night. For my part, I can't see but paste [50]   looks just as well.
Bart. Oh there ish no difference at all—none at all—it shall be done out of hand.
Lady Night. Immediately.
Bart. Then I'll set about it at once. (Rising to go.) Your ladyship will trust them in my hands—they will be as safe as in your own.
Lady Night. Believe me, I haven't the smallest suspicion of your honesty.
Bart. When your ladyship knows me better, you'll find me an honester man than you take me for.
Lady Night. Oh, Sir, that is impossible.
Bart. I kindly take my leave—I beg your ladyship will not stir.
                                         (Exit.) Lady Night. So I think now I shall be even with them all—it is almost impossible the transaction should be discovered, and if it is, the diamonds have been thro' other hands, and the fact can never be brought home to me. The price of them will fit up my rooms in the highest style, and give my bank an eclat that will certainly bring me full repayment with interest, by the end of the season.


END OF ACT III.

[Page 35]
ACT IV. SCENE I. Lady Wellgrove's. Lady Wellgrove and Barton . Lady Well. A thousand thanks, my dear Sir, for this visit.
Bart. You will perhaps think yourself less obliged when you understand I am come to give advice.
Lady Well. Indeed you wrong me.—When did I ever listen to your advice without pleasure?
Bart. Well, well, to do you justice you have always been a good girl, but the point on which I am going to touch is of so tender a nature that—
Enter Servant. Serv. Mr. Hint, Madam.
Lady Well. The impertinent fool, what can he want?—well, shew him up.
                                         (Exit Servant.) Bart. If you have visitors, I'll take some other opportunity.
Lady Well. No, don't go. I'll dispatch him immediately.
Enter Hint . Hint. Beg pardon, but was informed you were alone—have heard no doubt of the elopement?
Bart. Of Miss Sedgemore, Sir.
Hint. The same, Sir.
Lady Well. The very thing I wanted to know about. Pray, Mr. Hint, tell us the particulars.

[Page 36]
Bart. Do, Sir, favour us with the circumstances.
Hint. (Affectedly.) Who I? psha! how should I know any thing about it?
Lady Well. [25]   Come, come, this is all affectation.
Bart. Pray, Sir, oblige us with the particulars.
Hint. Gad, I believe you think I know every thing, though, to do myself justice, there is only one person besides the parties themselves—a certain insignificant individual—a fellow of no discernment or penetration—
Lady Well. Come, come, this is tantalizing.
Bart. Pray, Sir, don't keep us in suspense.
Hint. Why then you must know, one of the post-boys who drove them the last stage to Gretna Green—
Bart. Gretna Green, Sir?
Hint. Yes, Sir, Gretna Green.
Bart. Why, Sir, the parties eloped only three hours ago, and it's impossible any information could have arrived from Gretna Green.
Hint. May be impossible, Sir, but it's very true for all that—believe my information may generally be depended upon.—However, Sir, as you seem to know a great deal more of the matter than I do, wish you a very good morning—did indeed intend to give you a chronological and exact account of the whole proceeding—might, perhaps, have told you that the lady and her gallant set off in one post-chaise, and were immediately after followed by the lady's [50]   guardian in another.
Bart. Her guardian, Sir?
Hint. Yes, Sir, her guardian, Old Barton—as crusty an old curmudgeon as any in England. Perhaps, Sir, you mean to dispute that.
Bart. Oh, no, Sir, I perceive you're much better acquainted with him than I am.
Hint. Might have informed you how the lovers were detained at Barnet, by one of the horses falling down with the staggers; and would inevitably have been overtaken by Old Square-toes, had not the
[Page 37]
linch-pin suddenly flown out of the wheel of his chaise, just as fresh horses were put to in their's— that they arrived without further accident on the Scotch borders—that Old Vulcan insisted upon having two hundred pounds—that the gentleman remonstrated —that the lady almost fainted with the apprehension that the ceremony would not be performed— but that the blacksmith was obstinate and the money was paid.—I might have told all this; nor shall you ever hear from me, tho' nobody else knows it, that the poor unfortunate devil of a lover, whom she had cruelly jilted, (had it from his own mouth) has been raving ever since, and was this morning conveyed by his friends to a private madhouse.
Enter Servant. Serv. [75]   A letter for Mr. Hint.
Hint. For me?
Serv. Yes, Sir, the servant who brought it was directed to follow you here.
                                         (Exit.) Hint. Have I your pardon?
                                         (breaking open the letter.) Lady Well. By all means.
Hint. (Reads.) “Sir,—Tho' averse to the arbitrament of the sword, I have a character which must be supported; I will therefore meet you at the Ring within the hour.—Your much injured friend, George Waverly.”
                                         (Drops the letter.) Lady Well. Bless me, Mr. Hint, I am afraid you've received some uncomfortable news?
Bart. The sudden death of some near relation, perhaps?
Hint. Sudden death! this is the most unaccountable, surprising sort of thing; within the hour! Zounds! I wouldn't dine with the Lord Mayor upon so short an invitation, and can he possibly think that—Why there'd be hardly time to send privately to Bow-street for the peace-officers—this is the most unaccountable, surprising, miraculous—pardon my
[Page 38]
abruptness—d—me, if it is'nt—quite incomprehensible!
                                         (Exit.) Bart. Pray, is that gentleman one of your intimate acquaintance?
Lady Well. [100]   Yes, he is as useful as a daily paper; except that he comes out a little later. I think his information is about as important, and his veracity as much to be depended upon.
Bart. But to resume the subject which he interrupted. I have been informed of your partiality for Young Sedgemore; nay, it is rumoured you have consented to marry him immediately.
Lady Well. My partiality to Mr. Sedgemore, I candidly avow, but the rest of the rumour is false; and you may rest assured, my dear Sir, I shall never finally resolve on so important a point without consulting you.
Bart. Tho' I have lost the authority of a guardian, I should indeed have been mortified to have forfeited the influence of a friend; and as you have frankly confessed your love for Mr. Sedgemore—
Lady Well. Does not every body love him, Sir?— is he not brave, generous, and accomplished?
Bart. I won't deny his merit; but were his virtues ten times greater than they are, one odious vice overshades them all; his detestable propensity to gaming.
Lady Well. Oh, that's the intemperance of youth; when he is mine, I trust I shall have influence enough [125]   to cure him of it.
Bart. Cure him first, and marry him afterwards; but to communicate to you a fact, of which you cannot be too soon apprized, he is already a ruined man.
Lady Well. Ruin'd?
Bart. Yes, by me.
Lady Well. Ah! Sir, that's impossible.
Bart. You know his estate is deeply indebted to me as his steward, besides which, I have, in the character
[Page 39]
of a money-lender, advanced him large sums upon such exorbitant interest, that his whole estate is in my power, and, within an hour, he will be arrested at my suit.
Lady Well. My dear Sir, how can you have the inhumanity—
Bart. Spare your reproaches;—tho' he has been a libertine, I don't mean to proportion his penance to his transgressions; and, as he is not yet an hardened sinner, I shall only consign him for a short time to the house of correction.
Lady Well. I have too high an opinion of your humanity, to suppose you would give unnecessary pain; but may not the extremity of your purpose, instead of awakening him to reflection, drive him to despair?
Bart. [150]   Leave me to manage it, and doubt not of success. If I fail to rouse his pride, still I have preserved his fortune; and, if I succeed in rooting from his bosom this selfish and contemptible vice of gaming, I may proudly present him to you as a husband every way worthy your affection.
                                         (Exit.) Lady Well. Farewel, Sir; tho' I hope every thing, I cannot but tremble for the event.
Enter Sapling . Sap. Hist! hist! Cousin Letty, stop a moment.
Lady Well. Oh, you creature, don't teaze me now.
Sap. Nay, I don't want to teaze you never. Do but listen for a moment; it will be worth your while, for 'tis the last time as I shall ever talk to you of our love matters.
Lady Well. Well, as you promise it shall be the last time, let us once more discuss them;—we may do it safely, for we dislike one another too much to quarrel.
Sap. Aye, so we do, that's lucky.—You know, cousin, father sent me up to town to marry you.
Lady Well. I do indeed; you told me so the moment you arrived, and have tagged it to every “How d'ye do” and “Good bye” ever since.

[Page 40]
Sap. Now it seems you don't care for father, and wont do as he orders. Though I dursn't but marry you, if you were willing, though you were uglier [175]   than old Jenny Goggle, of Gorgon Hall.
Lady Well. Thank you, cousin; I obeyed my own parents scrupulously, and will never obey any body else, out of respect to their memory.
Sap. Well, you must know, just as I was a putting my luggage a top of the heavy, to come up and marry you, father bid me mind my manners in town, and keep myself smart and sober, and genteel, or perhaps you might not take to me; now as you wont marry me no how, I don't see why I need be genteel any longer.
Lady Well. As you please, cousin; adopt whatever graces sit upon you easiest, only keep to our agreement, and be this our last tender conversation.
Sap. Thank you, cousin; thank you. The graces that suit me best are a roaring party, and cracking a dozen or two of wine;—now I know of a rare merry meeting to night, if you will not tell father.
Lady Well. Oh, never fear me. Run out of bounds as far as pleases you, I am no spy for the schoolmaster.
Sap. Well, but one word more. You know when I go back, father will be cantankerous; now, wont you write a letter to say I have been as genteel and graceful as heart could desire; and that we don't marry only because we have got no sympathies, or [200]   our hearts an't formed in the same mould; or some of the fine reasons people give, for not marrying, in story books;—father wont understand a word, and be so rarely taken in.
Lady Well. Well, dear cousin, as I now call you for the first, and I hope the last time, you shall dictate your own account of your own merits. I will use all my talent at embellishment, and your father shall learn that his son is as much a Chesterfield in manners as an Adonis in person;—and if he doesn't believe
[Page 41]
every syllable, he is the wisest father of the most foolish child I ever heard of.
                                         (Exit.) Sap. That's the second time she has called me a fool to-day.—That's proper good, just after her palaver about Adonis, and t'other gentleman she mentioned.—Now I'll shew these Londoners we country lads can be as flashy and high-bred as they. —I'll set-to with e'er a one of them, and I am mainly mistaken if they wont very soon find that my head's the hardest in company.
                                         (Exit Sapling .) SCENE II. THE PARK. Enter Sedgemore . Sedg. I am yet some minutes before my time.— Let me once more read his letter. (Reads.) What am I to conclude from this?—that, in the agitation of his mind, he has sent me the letter designed for another; or, that the whole is a paltry contrivance to cover his design;—no, he never could condescend to so mean an artifice. (Enter Hint .) S'death! this impertinent puppy again.
Hint. Servant, Sir.
Sedg. Sir, I wish to be alone.
Hint. Wants to destroy himself. (Aside.) Know you wish to be alone, Sir.
Sedg. Indeed, Sir?
Hint. Think I can give a pretty shrewd guess at your business here.
Sedg. Then, Sir, you must know it is a business of which all men are so much ashamed, that they do it with few witnesses!
Hint. Certainly going to drown himself in the Serpentine;—I shall prevent him tho'.
                                         (aside.) Sedg. Waverly not in sight yet.

[Page 42]
Hint. If I should save him now, (aside) —my dear Sir, do consider the consequences.
Sedg. Sir, I have considered the consequences.
Hint. [25]   Consider what a paragraph it will make— yesterday morning a young man genteely dress'd was taken out of the Serpentine-River, without any signs of life. The means recommended by the Humane Society were made use of three hours without effect.
Sedg. This is the most impudent fellow—
Hint. The body now lies at St. Martin's bone-house to be owned.
Enter Waverly . Oh now my time is come.
Wav. Mr. Sedgemore, your servant.—Hint, I thank you heartily for your punctuality, you received my letter I suppose?
Hint. Yes, I received your letter, or you wouldn't have seen me here, I promise you.
                                         (Aside.) Wav. Mr. Sedgemore, you seem unprovided with a friend.
Sedg. I hope, Mr. Waverly, we shall be able to settle our business without one.
Wav. By all means, if that mode is more agreeable to you.
Hint. What the devil does all this mean?
                                         (Aside.) Wav. My dear fellow, let me thank you again for your punctuality, but as it happens I shan't have occasion for you.
Hint. Shant you? I'm very glad of it.
                                         (Aside.) Wav. [50]   Not the least—and as you have already done me the favor to attend my summons, let me entreat you to add to the obligation by leaving us alone.
Hint. That I will with the utmost alacrity—I'll see what's going forward however.
                                         (Aside.)                                          Exit. Wav. Now, Sir, we are alone.
Sedg. Mr. Waverly, do me the favor to read that letter.

[Page 43]
Wav. (reads the letter) Well, Sir, I am perfectly acquainted with the letter, tho' not the means by which it came into your possession.
Sedg. Of that the direction will inform you.
Wav. Amazement! can it be possible?
Sedg. He's innocent, and I have wrong'd him— you then intended that letter for another.
Wav. For the gentleman who has just left us.
Sedg. Oh! Waverly, can you forgive the impetuosity of my feelings, and be again my friend?
Wav. As warmly as ever, my dear fellow, for to say the truth, appearances were devilish awkward. ( Hint crosses the back of the stage whistling.) Oh! Hint, are you there.
Hint. Yes, I am here.
Wav. Will you favour me with the letter you received [75]   this morning?
Hint. The letter! oh! yes, there it is.
                                         (Gives it.) Wav. There was a small mistake in the direction;— this was intended for you:—however, our differences are now happily settled without sword or pistol.
Hint. Thought there must be some mistake in the business.
Wav. I beg ten thousand pardons for having kept you so long in a state of apprehension.
Hint. Apprehension! oh no, not in the least, not at all alarmed; only, you know, if I had happened to have been popp'd off, I should have felt so damned awkward, not to have been able to give an account of the affair.
Sedg. This is the gentleman to whom I am obliged for the information of my sister's being at your chambers.
Hint. Who? me, Sir—under no obligations of that sort to me I assure you.
Sedg. Why, Sir, didn't you inform me Miss Sedgemore had been seen at this gentleman's chambers?
Hint. Lord bless you, Sir, not I—never heard of
[Page 44]
such a thing, you must certainly have dream't it— did want to pump me, (to Waverly ) but wouldn't do —you know my talent for closeness.
Wav. [100]   Oh! yes, I know it so well, that if I wish'd a thing to be known to half the town, I would immediately entrust it to you as a profound secret—you remember the affair of poor Miss Classic?
Hint. Nay, hang it, that's unmerciful now.
Wav. Didn't your talent for invention break off the long depending match betwixt her and Dr. Double-chin, and didn't the lady in a violent fit of despair—
Sedg. Hang or drown?
Wav. Neither; run away with her footman?
Hint. Out, by Jupiter, for every one knows it was the coachman.
Enter Nab , who taps Sedgemore and Waverly on the shoulder. Nab. Your servant, gemmen.
Hint. Hey! what!—tap on the shoulder—slight hint of a bailiff—take it immediately.
                                         (Runs off.) Sedg. Very familiar, Sir, but really I hav'n't the smallest recollection of your person.
Wav. Nor I.
Sedg. Your name, Sir?
Nab. Nab, Sir, Nab, at your service.
Wav. And your business?
Nab. My business, oh, a mere trifle—come, come, you needn't look so shy upon a brother officer.
Sedg. Indeed, Sir, and who is your commander?
Nab. The Sheriff of Middlesex, suppose you read [125]   my commission (serves them with a writ).
Wav. Hell and the devil, at the suit of my uncle!
Sedg. Barton to betray me thus!
Nab. I don't know what you may think of this, gentlemen, but its what I call doing business— damme its liming two birds with one twig.
Wav. And where, Mr. Birdcatcher, is it your pleasure—

[Page 45]
Nab. You'll find your new apartments very snug and agreeable—a clumsy bolt or two upon the door, and a few ugly iron bars across the window; then the room, to be sure, is very small, the air none of the sweetest, and the prospect damnable; but in all other respects—
Wav. Don't anticipate, Sir, don't anticipate, I've no doubt we shall find your house a paradise, with the devil always at our elbow; but as most probably we shall be there long enough to discover all its beauties, suppose you shew us the way.
Nab. Sir, with the utmost pleasure.
Wav. Courage, boy, (to Sedg.) we came here to cut one another's throats, let us now be employed in the nobler office of rousing one another's philosophy.
                                         (Exeunt.)

END OF ACT FOURTH.

[Page 46]
ACT V. SCENE I. A Spunging House. Waverly and Sedgemore sitting at a table. Wav. Well , Charles, here we are safely caged at last!—hang it, don't droop, boy, man is at best but the foot-ball of fortune.
Sedg. Ruin'd past redemption—our misfortune will immediately get wind, and every paltry, sneaking tradesman, who an hour ago would almost have kiss'd the earth to receive my commands, will now wear the brow of insolent superiority.
Wav. Why the rogues will be busy I'm afraid— what a happy life might a young man lead if none of his tradesmen ever became importunate before his undertaker.
Sedg. To be exposed to the insolent demands of my creditors, and the sneering pity of my friends— I will not endure it. (Takes out a pistol and lays it on the table.)
Wav. Why what the devil possesses you now?
Sedg. No matter—something must be done to save me from infamy.
Wav. What, by shooting yourself through the head—Believe me, Charles, the worst way of a man's atoning for his past irregularities, is by putting it out of his power ever to make amends for them.
Enter Nab . Nab. There's one Levi below inquires for you.

[Page 47]
Wav. Shew him up. (Exit Nab. We'll shoot [25]   him first, however—tho' perhaps he has heard of our misfortunes, and is come to bail us.
Sedg. Rather he is more alert than the rest, and learning we are caged, he is come to clip our wings.
Wav. Then I'll give him a specimen of what he is to expect.
Sedg. What d'ye mean?
Wav. Only to make him bail us. Come!—put up your pistol till we have occasion for it.—Here he comes.
Enter Barton . Bart. Shave you, Gentlemen, both—I couldn't think of taking my leave without inquiring how you like your new apartments—I suppose you can guess my business here—I came to—
Wav. Bail us, I know you did.
Bart. Then you know me more than ever entered my head—I came to lodge a detainer against you both.
Wav. You really did?
Bart. Yesh, you know, you will have no more occasion for me.
Sedg. Rather, friend Levi, you will have no more occasion for us.
Bart. Dat ish de same thing, you know—so now having told you my business, I shall humbly take my [50]   leave.
Wav. Indeed you will not.
Bart. No?
Sedg. No.
Wav. For thus I lodge a detainer against you.— (Presents a pistol.)
Sedg. And I another. (Presents another pistol.)
Bart. Why this ish new legal process.
Wav. Yes, a compendious mode of settling accounts between debtor and creditor, by double entry.
Bart. Very compendious indeed.

[Page 48]
Sedg. Yes, and as you approve of it, suppose we strike the balance immediately.
Bart. Oh, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob!
Sedg. No canting, Sir.
Bart. Mercy on me, mercy on me!
Wav. Now, Charles, are you prepared?
Sedg. Give the word.
Wav. Make ready, present—
Bart. Stop a moment, stop a moment—Bless me, what would you have?
Wav. Bail us immediately—you have acquired your riches by extortion, and now you shall part with a little of it by the same means—therefore bail us immediately, or—
Bart. [75]   Impossible!
Sedg. Then here goes.
Bart. Mercy on me! Stop a minute.
Wav. Not a second—promise immediately to bail us, or you shall be in Abraham's bosom in the snapping of a Trigger.
Bart. Oh, my moneysh, my moneysh!
Sedg. Promise, at once, or the prayers of fifty synagogues shan't save your bacon
Bart. My bacon! I am a Jew.
Wav. Now, Charles, make ready—present—F—
Bart. (Pulls off his disguise.)
Wav. My uncle?
Sedg. Barton?
Bart. Now an't you a couple of hopeful youths, an affectionate nephew, and a grateful ward? Who without judge or jury would have put me out of the world by double entry, for having preserved you both from beggary and ruin. Well, Gentlemen, what have you to say for yourselves?
Wav. Not a syllable—I don't think I had ever so little to say for myself in the whole course of my life.
Bart. Your friend here, perhaps, may give you some assistance.

[Page 49]
Sedg. [100]   Not I, Sir, upon my honour.
Bart. You young prodigals. I see a blush of amendment in your cheeks, the herald of returning virtue. Give me your hands—you have been a couple of wild young dogs, but I have redeemed all— behold in me your only creditor, and your true friend.
Sedg. My noble, generous benefactor!
Wav. My ever honoured uncle!
Bart. A truce with your praises, if you please.—I have settled your reckoning here, and we may depart immediately. I've a coach waiting, you must reinstate me in my disguise, for I have another game to play, which I'll explain to you as we go along.
                                         (They re-dress him.) Wav. Upon my soul, you have pitch'd upon a most happy disguise to conceal the practice of generosity.
Bart. No unmanly reflections, Sir—National prejudices are as false as they are illiberal. Believe me, I am not the only one who wears the heart of a Christian under the habit of a Jew. The seeds of benevolence are planted deep in every human heart; there is no bosom so barren and desolate as not to bear some blossoms of humanity.
                                         (Exeunt.) SCENE II. LADY WELLGROVE's. Lady Wellgrove sitting at Table. Lady Well. What a sleeping sluggard is time, when we most anxiously wish for his approach. The last half hour has appeared an age, and the next will be almost an eternity.—I'll steal and see if Julia is yet awake. (Goes into the chamber and returns.) The bitterest draught of misery has an opiate for the bosom at peace with itself.

[Page 50]
Enter Servant. Serv. My lady Nightshade and Lord Fillagree.
Lady Well. Shew them up. (Exit Servant.) What can they want?—Perhaps her ladyship may have heard that I have given an asylum to her Ward, and is come to claim her.
Enter Lady Nightshade , and Lord Fillagree . Good-morrow, Madam—Lord Fillagree, your servant —the honour of this visit is quite unexpected.
Lady Night. So I should imagine! but business of the first importance—
L. Fil. Yes, of the first importance, positively.
Lady Night. You are no doubt acquainted with the elopement of my niece?
Lady Well. I will not affect ignorance of it. (Aside)
Lady Night. And I am informed from pretty tolerable authority the fugitive is now in your house.
Lady Well. It is a fact I will not deny.
Lady Night. I suppose she has trumped up a pretty [25]   story to amuse your Ladyship with, and I have no doubt has made very free with my character, and his Lordship's, whose bare civilities as a man of gallantry, were mistaken by her rustic ignorance for violence, he! he! he!
L. Fil. Was there ever any thing half so ridiculous, ha! ha!
Lady Night. Therefore as your Ladyship has had the candour to confess she is in your house, I make no doubt you will immediately restore her to me, who come to claim her both as her guardian and her relation.
Lady Well. Your Ladyship must pardon me—my respect for truth has induced me to avow the protection I have afforded Miss Sedgemore, and my regard for justice and humanity impel me to continue it.
Lady Night. Very well, madam, vastly well—you'll please to recollect she's a Ward of Chancery.

[Page 51]
Lady Well. It might perhaps have been better if your Ladyship had recollected that.
Lady Night. Very well, Madam, vastly well— you'll recollect there's such a thing as law, but I suppose you are above that.
Lady Well. By no means—they only think themselves above law who attempt to violate it with impunity. [50]   As a relation of Miss Sedgemore, the law has appointed your Ladyship joint guardian of her honor and her fortune. You best know how you have executed that trust; but till that point is settled, I must be excused for doubting your title to resume it.
Lady Night. Then, Madam, I shall be under the necessity of searching your house.
Lady Well. Your Ladyship, I trust, will do nothing derogatory to the manners of a gentlewoman.
Enter Sapling , drunk. Sap. Ah! Jenny, (without) so here I am at last.
L. Fil. Who the devil have we here!
Sap. Damme but we've had a night of it—a set of high dogs. (Mimicks them.)
Lady Well. My hopeful cousin in this state.
Sap. Sir Harry, drink off your heel taps—my Lord, what d'ye think of the devil—not half hot enough.— Fill as you please, and drink as you fill.
L. Fil. Filthy fellow.
Sap. Buz you my Lord—Buz, buz, buz—damme I think there was nothing but buz—and now I'll go to bed.
Lady Well. Sir, I hope you'll go to bed in your own house.
Sap. My own house—that's a very good joke what, I suppose that isn't my bed-chamber?
Lady Well. [75]   I tell you this is not your chamber— was there ever any thing so unfortunate?
Sap. Not my chamber—I know it by the keyhole.
Lady Well. I tell you it is not.
Sap. But I say it is. (They struggle— Sapling
[Page 52]
comes with his back against the door, and forces it open —he goes in, Miss Sedgemore comes out, and he follows her.) Damme but I've bolted her, or rather I have unbolted her.
Lady Night. So, Miss, you are discovered at last, and I'll see who'll now interpose between you and my lawful authority.
L. Fil. Yes, I'll see who'll now interpose between us and lawful authority.
Sap. (Puts himself in their way.) Not an inch further—I started the game, and you have nothing to do with it. Besides, she's my own wounded bird, and no other sportsman shall hunt it down.
Lady Night. A very extraordinary person this.
L. Fil. Very extraordinary person indeed—pray Sir, do you happen to know that this lady is a Ward of Chancery?
Sap. Very possibly; but if the Lord Chancellor was to come for her, he should not have her—pray Sir, are you his bag-bearer?
L. Fil. His bag-bearer!—perhaps you are ignorant that I'm a peer of the realm.
Sap. [100]   Poo, never mind that—father's a baronet— keep off. (Puts himself in a boxing attitude.)
L. Fil. I think we had better send for a constable.
Sap. A constable?
L. Fil. I'll no longer endure it. (The women scream— Waverly and Sedgemore enter.)
Wav. Hollo! what the devil's the matter here?
Sap. Ho! ho! more company! Then I'll go to bed—damme, I'll go to bed. (Staggers off.)
Lady Night. Oh, Charles, I'm glad you're come— your sister is discovered at last.
Sedg. Yes, Madam, so is your Ladyship.
Lady Night. What d'ye mean?
Sedg. Nothing, only a Jew has been taken up attempting to dispose of certain diamonds, the property of my sister.
Lady Night. Well, Sir?

[Page 53]
Wav. And has confessed to have received the jewels from your Ladyship, for the purpose of selling them.
Lady Night. A mighty ingenious story.—And pray where is this honest Jew?
Wav. Call the Jew into court.
Lady Night. (aside.) Surely he cannot have betrayed me—at all events I must face it out.
Enter Barton , disguised as the Jew. Lady Night. Is this the person you speak of?
Wav. [125]   Does your Ladyship affect ignorance of him?
Bart. You are too quick upon her Ladyship—she will know me by and bye. Besides her Ladyship never saw me but once, and then she was more taken with my talents for secrecy than with the beauty of my countenance.
Lady Night. And pray, Sir, have you any thing to accuse me of?
Bart. Oh, nothing at all—nothing at all—every one has a right to dispose of their own jewels, especially when they are left them by their dear deceased lords, and you have done no more. There ish not the leasht harm in the transaction; and now, having confessed it as a Jew, I am ready to bear witness to it as a Christian.
                                         (Discovers himself.) Lady Night. Barton!
Bart. I told your Ladyship you would find me an honester man than you took me for.
Lady Night. This is all a plot to murder my reputation.
L. Fil. A most infernal plot, positively.
Lady Night. Very well, gentlemen—mighty well— it is now your time to triumph; but beware how you sport with the character of a woman of my rank.
Bart. We shall be at least as tender of it as ever [150]   your ladyship was.
Lady Night. Will your lordship leave this place?
L. Fil. Immediately—I protest I feel quite uncomfortable
[Page 54]
—will your ladyship give me leave?— (Offering his hand.)
Lady Night. Oh! the monsters!
                                         (Exeunt Lord Fil. and Lady Night .) Bart. So, so, so, (looking at Sedgemore and Lady Wellgrove , who keep at a distance from each other). Now I am sure you both wish to be nearer together, by your taking such extraordinary pains to keep at a distance.
Lady Well. Indeed, Sir, you're very much mistaken.
Bart. (To Sedg. ) Zounds, why don't you make your advances?—she can't in decency surrender till you begin the attack.
Sedg. Great as my offence has been, my punishment has already exceeded it. Can nothing convince you of my contrition?
Lady Well. Nothing. Yes, time, time may shew your sincerity; tho', upon second thoughts, I don't think even time can do it. No, I'm so convinced your offence can never be obliterated by time, that I think I may as well forgive you at once—there (gives him her hand); behave better for the future.
Sedg. Who wouldn't transgress, to be thus forgiven?
Bart. Here, Julia, are your diamonds (gives the casket); [175]   and Waverly, here is a diamond for you of the first water and the brightest polish (gives Julia to Waverly). Preserve her faithfully in your bosom, and set her deeply in your heart, and remember that nothing can ever rob you of your treasure, whilst you keep the key to her affections. This has been a busy day for us all, and we hope our friends here will not think it labour in vain.

Their helping hands, “The Guardians,” should engage,
Their care; the real Guardians of the Stage. Back matter

FINIS.

[Page 55]

EPILOGUE. (Speaking at the Stage Door.)
I will go forth and speak it—let me through, Man. (Entering.)
The Epilogue's among the rights of woman.
Though through your Timon not a female's heard—
The play once done, no man shall say a word.
Ladies, my wrongs are yours. Shall actors flout us—
Shall managers pretend to do without us?
And persevere, for they have dared begin it,
To act a play without a woman in it?
They cry—“'Tis Shakespeare's.” Then I must confess
It much destroys my reverence for Queen Bess.
She, who the French could tame—the Spaniard fetter—
Might sure have taught her saucy poet better.
Thus fierce with rage—no prompter's mandate checks—
Ladies, I stand the champion of the sex,
And for our Bard claim your applause by right—
For women guide our moral plot to-night.
And hard, and bold, and high in praise should be
The task our closing Drama leaves to me. 2
A gamester thus by wedlock to reclaim!
How many think I play a desperate game—
Yet can good wives, if wise, in every station
On man work miracles of reformation.
And were such wives more common, I'd ensure it,
However great the malady, they'd cure it.
And much their aid is wanted in a nation
That plays so deep the game of speculation.
Some to pursue it in St. Giles's meet—
Some more genteely in St. James's street.
To hazard thousands at a single throw,
Or sink a penny on a little Go.
Here rises briskly from his morning slumber—
One who's been dreaming of a lucky number.
His fortune's made—he seeks the shop where prizes
In golden rhymes are promised of all sizes.
With head brim-full of wealth—and empty purse—
The letter comes.—Alas! 'tis all blank verse.
In vain the lover hangs o'er Chloe's charms—
What's love to her—while Pam is in her arms.
[Page 56]

What on her cheek can raise the glowing blush:
A lover's tender vows?—Oh, no—a flush.
An Author too stakes deep who dares engage,
His all, in that uncertain game, the Stage.
When ye who here in solemn judgment sit—
Approve his satire—or applaud his wit—
He thanks his stars for such a lucky hit.
Scores up his winnings, leaves the table gay,
And stakes again upon another play.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I.
A range of hills, o'erhung with waving woods,
That spread their dark green bosoms to the clouds,
And seem to crave the tribute of a show'r,
Grateful to woodland plant and mountain flow'r—
A glen beneath frae whilk a bick'rin' burn
Strays round the knowes, wi' bonny wimplin' turn,
Syne trottin' down-wards thro' the cultur'd lands,
Runs by whare Gaffer's humble biggin' stands:
His wife an' him are at some family plea,
To bear what ails them, just step in and see. Gaffer and Mirren . Mirren.
“ Love should be free!”—My trouth but ye craw crouse,
You a Gudeman, an' canna' rule your house!
Had I a father's pow'r, I'd let her see,
Wi' vengeance, whether or no that love be free.
She kends right weel Muirland has ilk thing ready,
An's fit to keep her busket like a lady,
[Page 12]

Yet soon's she hears me mention Muirland Willie,
She skits an' flings like ony towmont filly—
Deil, nor ye'd broke your leg, gaun cross the hallan,
That day ye fee'd the skelpor Highland callan,

Base wretch, to steal our Dochter's heart awa'!
“Love should be free!” gude trouth, a bonny story!
That Muirland maun be lost for Highland Harry .
[25]   Muirland comes down this night—to tauk's nae use,
For she shall gie consent or lea' the house.
Oddsaffs! my heart did never wallop cadgier
Than when the Laird took Harry for a sodger;
An' now she sits a' day sae dowf an' blearie,
An' sings luve sangs about her Highland Harry. Gaf.
Indeed Gude-wife, the lad did weel enough,
Was eident ay, an' deftly hel' the pleugh;
But Muirland's up in years, an' shame to tell,
Has ne'er been married tho' as auld's mysel';
His locks are lyart, an' his joints are stiff,
A staff wad set him better than a wife.
Sooner shall roses in December blaw,
Sooner shall tulips flourish i'the snaw,
Sooner the woods shall bud wi' winter's cauld,
Than lasses quit a young man for an auld:

My say shall never mak' them disagree. Mir.
Ye hinna' the ambition o'a mouse,
She'll gie consent this night or lea' the house. Enter Jean in haste. Jean.

Isn't siller mak's our ladies gang sae braw?
Isn't siller buys their cleuks an' bonnets a'?

Wi' umbrellas, muffs, claeth-shoon, an' patons?
Our Lady,—what is't gars us curtsey till her,
An' ca' her Mam ? why, just 'cause she has siller;
Isn't siller mak's our gentles fair an sappy?
Whilk lets us see, it's siller mak's fouks happy. Jean.
Mither, ae simple question let me speir,
Is Muirland fat or fair wi' a' his gear?
Auld croighlin Wight, to hide the ails o'age,
He capers like a monkey on a stage;

An' cracks, an sings, an' gigles sae light an' kittle,
Wi's auld beard slaver'd wi' tobacco spittle.— Mir.
Peace, wardless slut—O, whan will youth be wise!
Ye'll slight your carefu' Mither's gude advice:
I've brought you up, an' made you what ye are;

Muirland comes down this night, sae drap your stodgin',
For ye must gie consent or change your lodgin'.                                          [Exit. Jean.

Our bonny Scots lads in their green tartan plaids,
   Their blue-belted bonnets, an' feathers sae braw,
[75]   Rank't up on the green war' fair to be seen,
   But my bonny young laddie was fairest of a';
His cheeks war' as red as the sweet heather-bell,
   Or the red western cloud lookin' down on the snaw,
His lang yellow hair o'er his braid shoulders fell,
   An' the eén o'the lasses war' fix'd on him a'.

My heart sunk wi' wae on the wearifu' day,
   When torn frae my bosom they march'd him awa',
He bade me farewell, he cried “O be leel.”

Ah! Harry my love, tho' thou ne'er shou'dst return,

Harry return'd, as servant to the Laird,
Finds, for a whyle, his presence may be spar'd,
An' here, his lane, he wanders o'er each scene,

He sees her cot, an' fain wad venture in,

Tir'd with the painful sight of human ills,
Hail Caledonia ! hail my native hills!
Here exil'd virtue rears her humble cell,
With nature's jocund, honest sons to dwell;
And hospitality, with open door,
Invites the stranger and the wand'ring poor;
Tho' winter scowls along our northern sky,
In hardships rear'd we learn humanity:

Nor dare deceit here point her rankling dart,
A Scotchman's eye's the window of his heart.—
When fate and adverse fortune bore me far,
O'er field and flood to join the din of war,
My young heart sicken'd, gloomy was my mind,
My love, my friends, my country all behind.
But whether tost upon the briny flood,
Or drag'd to combat in the scene of blood,
Hope , like an angel, charm'd my cares away,
And pointed forward to this happy day.
[25]   Full well I mind yon breckan-skirted thorn,
That sheds its milk-white blosoms by the burn,
There first my heart life's highest bliss did prove,
'Twas there my Jeanie blushing own'd her love.
Yon dark green plantins on the mountain's brow,
Yon yellow whins an' broomy knowes below,
Bring to my mind the happy, happy days,
I spent with her upon these rural braes—

I long to clasp my charmer in my arms.                                          [Exit.

Lang syne, beside the woodland burn,
   Amang the broom sae yellow,
I lean'd me 'neath the milk-white thorn,
   On nature's mossy pillow;
A' 'round my seat the flow'rs were strew'd,
That frae the wild wood I had pu'd,
To weave mysel' a simmer snood,
   To pleasure my dear fellow.

I twin'd the woodbine round the rose,
   Its richer hues to mellow,
Green sprigs of fragrant birk I chose,
   To busk the sedge sae yellow,

The crow-flow'r blue, an' meadow-pink,
I wove in primrose-braided link,
But little, little did I think
   I should have wove the willow.

My bonnie lad was forc'd afar,
   Tost on the raging billow,
Perhaps he's fa'n in bludy war,
   Or wreck'd on rocky shallow.
Yet, ay I hope for his return,
As round our wonted haunts I mourn,
And often by the woodland burn
   I pu' the weeping willow. Enter Muirland . Muir.

'Twas March the eight, that memorable day
Our sea-worn troops all weary with delay,
For six long days storm-rock'd we lay off shore,
And heard the en'mies guns menacing roar,
At length the wish'd-for orders came, to land ,
And drive the foe back from the mounded strand;
Then each a hero on the decks we stood,
Launch'd out our boats and speeded all we could;
While clouds of sulf'rous smoke obscur'd the view,
And show'rs of grape-shot from their batt'ries flew—
[75]   A brother Captain seated by my side,
Receiv'd a shot—he sunk—he quiver'd—died:
[Page 31]

With friendly hand I clos'd his life-gone eyes,
Our sighs, our tears were all his obsequies.
Then, as our rowers strove with lengthen'd sweep,
Back from the stern I tumbl'd in the deep,
And sure had perish'd, for each pressing wave
Seem'd emulous to be a soldier's grave;
Had not this gallant youth, at danger's shrine,
Off'ring his life a sacrifice for mine,
Leap'd from the boat and beat his billowy way,
To where I belch'd and struggl'd in the sea;
With God-like arm sustain'd life's sinking hope,
Till the succeeding rowers pick'd us up. Gaf.
Fair fa' your worth, my brave young sodger lad,
To see you safe return'd my heart is glad.
Ilk cottar round will lang your name regard,
An' bless you for your kindness to the Laird. Laird.
And when the day's hot work of war was done,
Each fight-tir'd soldier leaning on his gun,
I sought my brave deliverer, and made
An offer, with what influence I had
To raise his fortune; but he shun'd reward:
Yet warmly thank'd me for my kind regard;
Then, as in warmth I prais'd his good behavour,
[100]   He modestly besought me this one favour ,
[Page 32]

That if surviving when the war was o'er,
And safe return'd to Scotia once more,
I'd ask your will, for him to wed your Daughter;
A manly, virtuous heart he home hath brought her. Gaf.
Wi' a' my heart, he has my free consent ,
Wife, what say ye? I hope ye're weel content. Mir.

An' he wha deals in scandal only gains,
A rich repay of scandal, for his pains:
Ye hae our free excuse, ye needna' doubt it,
Ye'll ne'er, for us, mair hear a word about it. Muir.
That's a' I wish'd,—I cou'dna bide the thought,
To live on earth an' bear your scorn in ocht;
My heart's now hale,—ye soon shall hear the banns
Proclaim'd i'the Parish Kirk 'tween me an' Nanse;
I'm no' the first auld chield wha's gotten a slight,—
I'll owre the muir,—sae, fareweel a' this night!                                          [Exit. Gaf.
Of a' experience, that bears aff the bell,
Whilk lets a body rightly ken' himsel'. Jean.
May lasses, when their joes are far frae hame,
Bid stragglin' wooers gang the gaits they came,
Else aiblins when their moonshine courtship's past,
They'll hae to wed auld dotards at the last. Mir.
Gudewives shou'd ay be subject to their men;
I'll ne'er speak contrar to your will again.
[Page 36]
Gaf.
That's right, gudewife,—I'm sure I weel may say,
Glen-feoch never saw sae blest a day.
Young fouks,—we'll set the bridal-day the morn,—
But Lucky, haste bring ben the Christmas horn,
Let's pour ae sacred bumper to the Laird,
A glass, to crown a wish, was never better wair'd. Harry.
[200]   While I was yet a boy, my parents died,
And left me poor and friendless, wand'ring wide,
Your goodness found me, 'neath your fost'ring care,
I learn'd those precepts which I'll still revere,
And now, to heav'n, for length of life I pray,
With filial love your goodness to repay. Gaf.
This sacred maxim let us still regard,
That “ Virtue ever is its own reward .”
And what we give to succour the distrest,
Calls down from heav'n a blessing on the rest. NOTES

Main text ACT I. SCENE 1st. —The Temple of Jupiter. CALCHAS at the Altar.
Hear Jove supreme!
Thou! who, o'er all in highest heav'n enthron'd,
Look'st on the frail inhabitants of earth,
Oh hear my prayer! let not the sun, new ris'n
On this dread day, unconscious of thy pow'r
Withdraw its beams—bid Argos own thy might;
While thou, in visitation of thy wrath,
On the polluted feast of lust and murther
Shalt loose the impatient thunder! NIREUS enters.
                                         Calchas, hail!
[Page 120]
CALCHAS.
What brings thee hither? NIREUS.
                                         Clytemnestra's will.
This day, when yearly rites, that mock the heav'ns,
Bid Argos solemnize the blood-stain'd nuptials,
Fear harrows up her soul. CALCHAS to himself.
                                         Their doom is fixt.
Not vain at dawn the omen. NIREUS.
                                         Clytemnestra
Now bids thee to the palace. CALCHAS.
                                         What, once more
To hear in insolence of pride, Ægisthus
Defy the vengeance of long-lingering Jove,
And taunt his holy priest! Yes—I will go:
If Jove confirm the omen—I will go:
[Page 121]

[25]   But not to sooth her terror. Yet, say first
Of wrong'd Electra. NIREUS.
                                         On this day's return,
Not only, as of old, Ægisthus binds
Her limbs with chains, and in the cavern's gloom
Bids her, unheard, rave on her long-lost brother,
Th'avenger, lorn Orestes— CALCHAS —(interrupting him.)
                                         Hear, hear heav'n! NIREUS.
But ere the sun go down, his vow is past
To join by force the daughter of Atrides
With one low-born: that never heir arise
To claim the crown of Argos, or avenge
Her murther'd sire. CALCHAS.
                                         The measure is complete.
'Tis doom'd above, the impious are no more.
[Page 122]

I will consult the God—Nireus retire—                                          Exeunt. SCENE 2nd —An apartment in the palace. Ægisthus—Clytemnestra. ÆGISTHUS.
Scorn Clytemnestra these unwonted fears:
Prepare to grace the triumph. CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         No Ægisthus—
Not oracles, nor voice of answering shrine,
Signs from the flight of bird, or bleeding victim,
So mark impending doom, as this night-vision,
The harbinger of vengeance. ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Clytemnestra,
Shall idle terrors, shadows of a dream
Subdue thy daring spirit? these are mock'ries
That dotage dwells on, or the senseless fears
Of credulous childhood—
[Page 123]
CLYTEMNESTRA —(interrupting him.)
                     Hear me— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         I have seen thee
Mid the fierce clamours of the madd'ning tumult
Stand with undaunted brow. CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Thou hast beheld me
Stain'd with the blood of man, a warrior's blood.
The woman stood before astonish'd Argos,
Her dagger dropping gore—I dread none earthly.
This supernatural sight o'er-powers my soul.
Look here—while Clytemnestra shakes before thee,
Hast thou no fear? ÆGISTHUS.
                                         None from the dreams of night.
[25]   While yet Orestes liv'd— CLYTEMNESTRA —(interrupting him.)
                                         Is he too murther'd?
[Page 124]
ÆGISTHUS.
If gold can bribe, Orestes is no more—
Why droops thy brow? his father's spirit fir'd him:
His hate pursu'd, his vengeful blade hung o'er us.
Speak I ungrateful words, thy son is dead? CLYTEMNESTRA.
Thou never hadst a child— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Mourn not his loss. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Here, at this breast he hung. Messenger enters.
                                         Dread Lord, the pomp
Waits but thy presence— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Go—bid sorth my train.
Come Clytemnestra, rob'd in Troy's proud spoils
Grace, as of old, the triumph. CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         No—Ægisthus—
[Page 125]

The horror, that o'er-pow'rs me, on my brow
Deep stamps its visible impress—let the base
Conceal their fear: such as I am behold me—
I know not female artifice that lends
The lip of misery a dissembling smile.
No robe of Phrygian state shall blaze on me,
No banquet hail my presence— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Have I wrong'd thee?
Dost thou repent the deed that joins our doom? CLYTEMNESTRA.
Were it again to act, again this hand
[50]   Would slay the man who wrong'd me—thee, Ægisthus,
I still have faithful found. Whate'er the doom
That Jove decrees, tho' thunder burst around me,
Thee I will ne'er desert. ÆGISTHUS.
                                         I know thee now. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Go, glitter in thy splendor. Yet—I pray thee—
[Page 126]

Yet—nay I charge thee, that no word, no look,
No, not a silent smile betray contempt.
I brook not insult, less from thee than all—
Beware— ÆGISTHUS.
                     Why this to me? speak— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         When the spectre
Glar'd on me as I shriek'd—thou—dost not heed me.
'Tis man thou fear'st—hast thou no other fear? ÆGISTHUS.
Say on— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         I breath'd aloud a vow to heav'n—
Confirm it— ÆGISTHUS.
                     Can I aid thee? CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Bid Electra
On Agamemnon's sepulchre, complete
[Page 127]

The funeral rites! We reckt not of the dead.
Th'accepted offerings haply may appease
The avenging spirit—from this blood-stain'd hand
Such rites were profanation. ÆGISTHUS.
                                         But Electra
[75]   Now groans in chains, and, ere the night-fall, forc'd
To hateful nuptials, vents her idle rage
Beneath a servile roof. CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Free her from chains.
Urge not the unequal tye. I have but her.
Yet, if regardless of a mother's will
That daughter mock my fear, fix thou her doom,
E'en what thou wilt, so I no more behold her.
Her voice has terror in it: and her eye
In awful silence fixt on mine, exerts
Strange mastery o'er my spirit— Messenger enters.
                                         Calchas comes.
[Page 128]
CLYTEMNESTRA.
Say thou consent'st— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         In all be thou obey'd. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Avoid the indignant prophet.                                          (Ægisthus exit, as Calchas enters.)
                                         Holy Seer!
Accept thy Sovereign's thanks, that thou, long time
A stranger to this palace, once again,
At Clytemnestra's call, hast deigned to hear
What weighs upon her heart— CALCHAS —(interrupting her.)
                                         No thanks, for this,
To me are due—ere my reluctant step
Past o'er thy threshold, the inspected victim
Gave sign; alone that signal I obey'd— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Jove-honor'd prophet! super-natural horrors
[100]   Mark me the victim of heav'n's imminent wrath.
[Page 129]
CALCHAS —(pointing up.)
There justice reigns—thou shalt not scape thy doom. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Thy prescience, Seer, can all unfold: thy pray'rs
Wing'd intercessors at the throne of Jove
Avert impending destiny, and turn
The thunder in its course. CALCHAS.
                                         Here prayer avails not.
When impious mortals tremble at their doom,
Alone repentance at the throne of Jove
Pleads, and is heard—Repent! CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Not—not for this
I call'd thee. Priest! thy office hallows thee:
Or, ere this hour, the tongue that rudely taunts
Its sovereign, had been mute.                                          (Calchas going in anger, she stops him.)
                     Stay—
[Page 130]
CALCHAS.
                                         Impious mortal!
I leave thee to thy fate— CLYTEMNESTRA —(detaining him.)
                                         Not unrevealed—
Or shield me from these horrors, or unfold
Clearly the dread unknown; that now my soul
May summon all its strength to meet heav'n's wrath.
Interpreter of fate wilt thou reveal it? CALCHAS.
I speak but what Jove dictates—thou, be brief— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Calchas, thou know'st, this day, ten years gone by,
The son of Atreus perish'd— CALCHAS.
[125]                                            Slain by thee— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Aye—I deny it not— CALCHAS.
                                         'Tis known to all.
[Page 131]
CLYTEMNESTRA.
Well then—I slew him—ever on this day
We hold a solemn festival at Argos,
In honor of my nuptials with Ægisthus:
Add—if thou wilt—of triumph o'er the slain.
This too is known to all—but 'tis not known,
That ever duly on this day's return,
E'en at the very instant, at the dead
Of midnight, when I smote him, a deep groan,
Such as he utter'd when he fell beneath me,
Bursts on my ear: and one, who cries “revenge,”
Floats by; a shapeless figure indistinct:
For I have gaz'd on't with unaltered eye,
'Till the dim shadow floated from my sight.
Last night the groan was heard, the voice was heard
Of one who cry'd “revenge:”—the shadow floated:
But, gradually the uncertain shape assum'd
The form of Agamemnon, mail'd in arms,
Such as he stands, terrific on his tomb.
[Page 132]
CALCHAS.
Didst thou then gaze with an unalter'd eye? CLYTEMNESTRA.
No—'twas himself—I could not gaze on him.
But, ere I turn'd, I saw the wound I made:
And thro' the steel forth gush'd the blood: he caught it,
[150]   And from the hollow of his hand pour'd forth
An offering to the Furies: then drew near
And cast the dregs on me. CALCHAS.
                                         That was no phantom. CLYTEMNESTRA.
'Twas fresh, 'twas living blood, 'twas warm to sense,
Such as it spouted on me when I smote him.
I turn'd aside, but still before my sight
Which way my scar'd eye glanc'd, arm'd Furies stood.
The viper brood that round their tresses tangled
Their scaly coils, turn'd all their stings on me.
On me, each bickering eye, that roll'd in blood,
Shot sparks of fire. A voice of thunder burst,
[Page 133]

“Thus, will we lap thy blood”—“the dead shall slay thee”—
I shriek'd: in rush'd the attendants. All was void—
But they too heard the iron of their feet
That echoed on the pavement: they beheld
The flames in trailing flakes along the gloom—
Say! how shall I appease th'avenging Furies? CALCHAS.
By offerings suited to their ruthless nature. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Prophet! explain those words—“the dead shall slay thee.” CALCHAS —(aside)
Aid me, inspiring Jove! CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Wilt thou not answer? CALCHAS.
In silence hear the pow'r, who guides my voice.— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Oh speak!—
[Page 134]
CALCHAS.
                                         This day, a stranger youth, heav'n-sent,
[175]   To Argos bears Orestes' funeral urn.—
He can unfold the mystery of fate.— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Would he were come! CALCHAS.
                                         He comes—obey the God—
Thou, and Ægisthus, to the secret bath
Where Agamemnon perish'd, lead the stranger;
There, force him to reveal, howe'er reluctant,
What Phœbus has imparted—bid Electra
On Agamemnon's tomb libations pour. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Where bled Atrides? said'st thou—in the bath—
Not there—not there—I pray thee.— CALCHAS.
                                         On that spot
Question the stranger youth: and, if averse
Force him to speak.—
[Page 135]
CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         I thank thee, Seer! farewell.— (Exeunt.                                          (as they go out, Ægisthus and Phanor enter.) PHANOR.
Electra doth refuse— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Refuse, to quit
The gloomy cell! PHANOR.
                                         “No earthly pow'r, this day,
“Shall force me to behold the light I loath.”—
Such were her words.— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Bid her expect my presence.                                          (Phanor goes.)
Oft, proud Electra, hast thou vainly sought
To bear thy offerings to Atrides' tomb.
If proffer'd, thou reject it, never more
[200]   Thy voice, domestic fiend, shall threat Ægisthus.                                          (Exit.
[Page 136]
SCENE 3rd. —A Prison. Electra.—Phanor enters. PHANOR.
Ægisthus comes. ELECTRA.
                                         Is there yet more to bear? ÆGISTHUS enters.
Go, Phanor— ELECTRA.
                                         No—be present—stir not hence—
With him I hold not secret conference.— ÆGISTHUS.
Yield not to vain suspicions—if thou wilt,
Detain him—bid him strictly note each word,
Record each look—Yet, were no witness near,
Woman, the weakness of thy sex protects thee.
Thou hast no cause for fear.— ELECTRA.
                                         Phanor, retire.— (he goes).
We dread not whom we scorn—speak, I am mute.
[Page 137]
ÆGISTHUS.
I would that we had met in fitter place! ELECTRA.
It suits a sufferer that delights in grief:
It suits an outrag'd soul that broods on vengeance:
It suits the day, the deed, thee most, base murderer!
Look on these chains: think on the groans of death
That echoed through these vaults. ÆGISTHUS.
                                         I come to grant
What thou hast oft implor'd. ELECTRA.
                                         I oft have claim'd
Rights still deny'd: the melancholy right
To shed a tear on the unhonour'd tomb
Of him whom thou did'st slay—I ne'er implor'd thee. ÆGISTHUS.
[25]   'Twere well that thou had'st sued—time was, Electra,
That I with gifts and proffer'd kindness sought
To sooth thy haughty spirit.
[Page 138]
ELECTRA.
                                         Gifts! to me!
Tyrant! thou speak'st to Agamemnon's daughter!
No bribe can lure the lion race to fawn— ÆGISTHUS.
Therefore the lion race is gall'd with chains. ELECTRA —(with vehement indignation.)
Where art thou, brother?—I had hope in thee—
The sun keeps on his course, and the firm earth
Rests on its base—Yet Jove holds sway in heav'n.— ÆGISTHUS.
I come to free thee from these slavish chains:
Free thee from nuptials that disgrace thy birth,
And bid thee offer at a father's tomb
The long-neglected rites.— ELECTRA.
                                         Thou mock'st me, tyrant— ÆGISTHUS.
I loose thy chains.—
[Page 139]
ELECTRA.
                                         No—not a link shall fall.—
These bonds are precious to me—time shall come
When such may chain thee where the Furies close
Their adamantine rivets.— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Dost thou wish
To honor Agamemnon? ELECTRA.
                                         More than life—
If life the sacrifice, my father! hear me!
For thee, another daughter gladly dies.
[50]   Iphigenia bleeds again in me. ÆGISTHUS.
Go forth, and place on Agamemnon's tomb
Thy mother's offerings. ELECTRA.
                                         Said I not, thou mock'st me?— ÆGISTHUS.
I mock thee not. 'Tis Clytemnestra's will.
[Page 140]
ELECTRA.
Her will! aid, heav'n! repentance yet may touch her!
Yes. I will bear the offerings. Lead me to her.                                          (Exeunt.

End of ACT 1st.
ACT II. SCENE I. —A Street within the Walls of Argos. Orestes bearing an Urn.— Pylades, Arcas . ARCAS.
Brave youths! by friendship join'd, and now by fate
In common danger yok'd, here safely rest.
None know you here. I, in strange garb disguis'd,
Long absent from these walls, will venture on,
And timely caution give.—
[Page 141]
PYLADES. (pointing to Orestes.)
                                         How deep his groan!
Grief, like the mildew on the bloom of spring,
Preys on his faded prime. Oh soothe his soul! ARCAS —(to Orestes.)
The oracle of Phœbus shall not fail.
Soon will your mission cease. ORESTES.
                     Oh! PYLADES.
                                         Why that groan? ARCAS.
He droops o'er-wearied—rest—behold the goal—
These are the walls of Argos. There, the palace
Tow'rs proudly eminent. ORESTES.
                     Oh! PYLADES.
                                         Droop not, brother.
[Page 142]
ARCAS.
Thou! whom these arms receiv'd, e'en from the cradle,
When sad Electra rescued thee from death,
Orestes! firmly execute thy charge.
Thou, Pylades! watch o'er him. Rouse his soul
By words that fire the hero. Here remain—
I will not long be absent.                                          (Exit. PYLADES.
                                         Lean on me.
[25]   Friend of my soul! thou more than brother, come,
Lean on this faithful breast!—tho' long the way,
And rough the mountain tract, I oft have seen thee
From dawn to night-fall urge the brindled wolf,
And laugh to scorn the partners of the chase,
That fainted in the noon-beam—silent—still—
Think on the race when you outstript the Phocian
Nam'd from his speed, the Brother of the wind.— ORESTES —(to himself.)
These are the walls of Argos.
[Page 143]
PYLADES.
                                         Look upon me—
Hast thou forgôt, when thou a boy didst wield
The cœstus weight, and level'd at a blow
Polydamas, who proud of giant size,
Unrival'd, buffeted in sport the wind? ORESTES —(to himself.)
There tow'rs the palace, proudly eminent.— PYLADES.
Alas! the themes once wont to please, avail not! ORESTES.
Oh dire disgrace! that Agamemnon's son
Should thus approach the palace of his fathers!
Thus lone, disguis'd, and stranger to his kin,
The midnight plunderer in the gloom that shrouds him,
Starts, as he falters on—Oh! Pylades!
We, in the light of day, 'mid wondering throngs,
When every eye gaz'd on us, oft have vow'd
To rush where glory summon'd us, tho' death
[Page 144]

Stood at the goal, and held the wreath to crown us.
[50]   But—now— PYLADES.
                                         Thou must obey th'inspiring God.
By artifice, not force ensure success—
Rouse from despair—revenge thy father's death! ORESTES.
By any deed but this—a mother's murther! ARCAS enters.
Brave youths! go boldly on—the palace gates
Are left without a guard: and Clytemnestra,
(So rumour speaks) lone broods o'er boding fears. ORESTES —(with horror.)
Not that the place—not this th'appointed hour—
At midnight—in the bath—where fell my father—
Not in obscure response Apollo spoke. ARCAS.
First Orestes
Bear the feign'd tale to Clytemnestra's ear.
That done, on Agamemnon's tomb complete
[Page 145]

The funeral rites. There claim th'appointed signal.
On that thy doom depends: on that, the faith
Due to the Delphic shrine. Thy father's image
Shall, as instinct with life, thrice wave his lance;
Or we are made the mockery of vain words,
And murder stalks unpunish'd—                                          (A festive chorus in the procession of Ægisthus is heard.)
                                         Hark! that sound
As of some festive choir! PHANOR —(with some of Ægisthus's guards enters.)
                                         What may this mean?
Why bends that mourner o'er the funeral urn?
Nought of disastrous portent on this day
[75]   Shall cloud rejoicing Argos—Hence!— (to Orestes.) ORESTES.
                                         Beware— ARCAS.
Touch not that youth—we mean not to offend—
[Page 146]
PHANOR.
Hence! PYLADES.
                                         Say, ere we depart, why rings the shout
Of joy and choral song? PHANOR.
                                         'Tis Argos' feast,
Her annual feast: when every slave, and captive
Free as his lord, the common banquet shares. PYLADES.
What cause thus consecrates a nation's joy? PHANOR.
Ægisthus's nuptials! ORESTES.                                          (who, till now, had appear'd regardless of their discourse, bursts forward.)
                     Slave! 'tis false. PYLADES.

On self-destruction—Guards and thronging crouds
Compass him round.— ORESTES.
                                         Nor guards, nor throngs avail,
When vengeance strikes the blow by justice doom'd,
It strikes like heav'ns wing'd bolt: earth quakes beneath it,

At Jove's right hand!—Away— PYLADES. (restraining him.)

Ha! PYLADES.
                     Hear me! ORESTES.
                                         Any pray'r—but that—but that—
Thou sway'st at will each impulse of my soul.— PYLADES.

Thy influence o'er me—heard'st thou? 'tis his feast!

It is Ægisthus, not a mother's breast
I haste to pierce.— PYLADES.

Art should prevail, not force. ORESTES —(his hand on his breast.)
                                         Here—here it speaks—
I want no other oracle. Stay thou—
Jove! let me strike him dead! I ask not life.
Farewell.—                                          (as he rushes out, Pylades embraces him.) PYLADES.
                     We die together.— ORESTES.

Lead on! ORESTES.

Mould, mould me at thy will—what shall I do? PYLADES.
Swear, if thou meet the tyrant in mid triumph,
Thou wilt not strike him ere th'appointed time. ORESTES.

Guards! force him from the place— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         What means this tumult? PHANOR.
Look not this way—oh King! some men, obscure,
Strangers, it seems, to Argos— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Ha! an urn
Crossing our pomp! reveal your name, your country.
What here your purpose?—speak— ORESTES.

Thrice welcome! strangers! share our joyful feast—
Not unrewarded you return from Argos.—
Give him that royal robe.— ORESTES.

We may not share the banquet—look on this. (the urn).

By whose command we bear the last remains
Of him that was Orestes—When he fell

Before the Altar of the Delphian God
Slain by an Argive,— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         —Cease—we reck not this— ORESTES.
King! it imports thee much—When slander strikes
The fetter'd slave, he, bold in innocence,
Confronts the base accuser, and asserts
The dignity of virtue! hear, Ægisthus!
Orestes slew the wretch who pierc'd his breast;
And the Assassin with his dying breath,
Pronounced— PYLADES —(endeavouring to silence him.)
                     Peace, Brother! ORESTES —(not regarding him.)
                                         —That Ægisthus sent him! ÆGISTHUS —(after a long pause.)
That urn, thou say'st, contains Orestes' ashes:
Why hither brought?—Phocis knows funeral rites.

ORESTES.
May not the ashes of a son repose
Where sleeps his sire?—May not one kindred tear
Be shed upon his urn, who never knew
In life the blessing of a kindred smile? ÆGISTHUS.
Electra lives—a mother's tear, no doubt— ORESTES. —(aside.)
A mother!— ÆGISTHUS.

The ashes of her son—

I dar'd not place them on my father's tomb,
'Till I had commun'd with thee— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Say—what cause?— ELECTRA.
What cause? And dost thou ask? And shall I speak it. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Haply thou deem'dst it base, beneath thy birth,
To take these gifts from other hands than mine?

ELECTRA.
I long have suffer'd base indignities—
Lo these—                                          (her chains.) CLYTEMNESTRA.
                     I bad Ægisthus free thee. ELECTRA.
                                         Yes,
He proffer'd—I refus'd— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Yet, in that guise,
Offerings were insult— ELECTRA.
                                         No—not that the insult—
[25]   This, this is profanation, when the woman
Who slew her husband, mocks his tomb with gifts. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Daughter—! ELECTRA.
                                         Oh would that I could answer—Mother!
[Page 157]
CLYTEMNESTRA.
My soul is overcharged with horror. Spare me— ELECTRA.
Therefore I came. 'Tis now the suited time
When words may pierce the soul. Oh! had I found thee
A thoughtless reveller, rob'd in nuptial pomp,
And smiling at the thron'd adulterer's side,
I never had addrest thee—now I view thee
Clad in the garb of woe: and thy pale hue
Marks the deep wound that festers in thy soul.
I see this, yet rejoice not: no, nor feel
The triumph that repays, exalts the opprest
When the oppressor falls. Behold these tears—
They stream for thee— (clasping Clytemnestra's hand.) CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         And have I yet a child? ELECTRA.
Oh pow'r of heav'n! now give me words of force
To change the soul. Turn not away, my mother!
No whisper of reproach shall wound thy ear.
[Page 158]

We long have been estrang'd, not known each other:
For ever, at my coming, base Ægisthus
Stood like a fiend between us. Oh my mother,
Year after year has past unheeded o'er thee.
In the brief breathing space, this side the tomb
[50]   In mercy left, one moment yet is thine:
The present—Now.
Oh! on the tablet of eternity
Record it by contrition— CLYTEMNESTRA —(highly agitated, aside.)
                                         Oh, I cannot! ELECTRA.
Turn not away—not for myself I plead.
All, I forgive thee, all. I plead for one
Lov'd more than life. I plead for lorn Orestes:
For a lov'd brother; for thy son, I plead.
Recal the wanderer— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                     Oh!

ELECTRA.
                                         At Argos crown him.
Restore him to the empire of his fathers;
So will I bear the votive gifts, and sooth
Him, him that was thy husband. I will tend
Thy troubled couch: nor leave thee at the hour
When guilt at death's approach shall rise before thee

Now, on my knees, I pray one moment hear me.
I saw thy big tear tremble. Oh, my mother!
We never, since the day my father died,
Have known one common woe. CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         No more detain me.
'Tis he—away— ELECTRA —(in anger.)
                                         Dost thou despise my prayer?
I on my bended knee, have clasp'd thy hand. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Say, wilt thou bear these offerings to the dead?

ELECTRA.
Yes: or I ne'er shall view my father's tomb. CLYTEMNESTRA.

Thou, that Electra! thou—Orestes' sister. ELECTRA.
Long suffering bears the show of length of years.
Be but Orestes safe, and life new-born
Will glow in every vein—thou answer'st not—

Why art thou silent? CLYTEMNESTRA —(impatiently.)
                                         Say, what brought thee hither?
Stranger! why thus transfixt in senseless woe?
Why gaze on her? I, I am Clytemnestra. ORESTES.
I come the bearer of a mournful tale
To thee and to thy race. ELECTRA.
                     Hah! CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Youth! disclose it. ORESTES.
Heav'n haply has possest thee with a spirit
That yields not to misfortune—on that brow— (Electra)

Who will not hear my tale of woe, unmov'd—
Let her depart: and one brief word unfolds
My mournful mission.—

Thou hear'st— ELECTRA.
[125]                                            I stir not hence—my soul is dead
Alike to joy and grief, save that alone
Which from a brother flows—and if thou bring
Ought of Orestes, 'till thy voice reveal it,
No force shall hence remove me.— ORESTES —(to Electra.)
                                         Arm thy soul—
Here lies, within this urn, what was Orestes.
An Argive basely slew him—We, from Phocis,
Bring this to place it in Atrides' tomb—
Thou hast my mission.—

Canst free my soul from agonising horror.

A feast is in the palace held this night:
I shall not join the revels—while they banquet,
Meet me alone. Things of high import urge.
Why dost thou turn away? ORESTES.

Oh! ask not that! CLYTEMNESTRA.

PYLADES.
                                         Why force me from thee? ORESTES.
Forbear— PYLADES.
                                         Not habit, nor the tyes of blood,
But sympathy of nature made us one;
We never have been sunder'd—hand in hand,
We still with equal pace have shap'd our course
Till this sad hour—our joys our griefs the same.
One cradle rock'd our infant sleep. Our sports
In youth the same; the same adventurous perils
Enur'd our growing strength to stem the battle— ORESTES.
Were it to stem the battle, Pylades!
We were not now to part! PYLADES.
                                         Yet, let me join thee.
Each wish, new springing in thy mind, ere utter'd,
My ready zeal prevented. Grant me this.
[Page 169]
ORESTES.
Brother, thou art unkind: it wrings my soul.
Strange doubts perplex—I will not long be absent.
There dwells the prophet. A brief word at once
Unveils the mystery. I go alone.
Farewel. PYLADES.
                                         Yet—go not thus in anger from me! ORESTES.
Come, to my heart. And, if it seem, my brother,
[25]   That there beyond just time I linger— PYLADES.
                                         Well— ORESTES.
Seek me. PYLADES.
                                         I shall not fail—this, this is kind.
One word—and then—farewell— ORESTES.

Now, by the vow that death should ne'er disjoin us,
When, prostrate at the hallow'd shrine of friendship,
Tears, for each other shed, gush'd forth; I charge thee
If the Seer threaten danger, call on me.— ORESTES.
I would not live without thee. Art thou answer'd? PYLADES.
Farewel. (Orestes goes.) His gloomy silence awes my soul. ARCAS enters.
Where is Orestes? leave him not, I charge thee— PYLADES.
Hast thou not prosper'd, Arcas? ARCAS.
                                         None are left
Of Troy's proud conquerors, save neglected veterans
Who dare not shew a scar. On every side
New dangers threat. Suspicion closely marks us.

Who falters in his answer— PHANOR —(to Arcas.)

In what have I offended? PHANOR.
                                         Not unwatch'd

Of sterner times, who shun us as a race
That have forgôt our fathers. Come thou forth
Where tortures shall force out unwilling truth. ARCAS —(looking on Pylades.)

Now let him enter. The clear sparkling flame                                          (Orestes slowly advances.
Gave no ungrateful sign—approach the altar. ORESTES.
Hail! CALCHAS.
                                         Not reluctance, youth! nor ought of honor
Due to the Minister of highest Jove
Delay'd thy entrance: holy rites enjoin'd it:
And suppliant Kings must wait 'till fav'ring omens
Permit approach.— ORESTES.
                                         Hail Seer! I bring thee not
Off'rings of votive gold, and precious incense:
No victim led by me shall stain the altar.
If heav'n, ungifted, hears not him who calls,
Seer, I retire in silence.
[Page 173]
CALCHAS.
                                         There are gifts
Of higher rate than gold and hecatombs:
Gifts, which from op'ning heav'n draw blessings down:
The tribute of an uncorrupted heart.
[75]   If such thy offering, speak— ORESTES.
                                         My years are few.
As yet—these hands are pure—but— CALCHAS.
                                         Freely speak. ORESTES.
If thou can read the heart, in mine behold
The bitter conflict of a troubled spirit,
That agonis'd by woe, doubt, fear, despair,
Dreads e'en the wreck of reason.—Seer, assist me. CALCHAS.
Poor youth! I pity thee—I will assist thee—
My voice shall still the tumult of thy soul.

ORESTES —(with vehemence.)
Not that—thou must not still my soul—oh rather
Urge to its height the storm, that so my arm
May execute its mission—holy Seer!
Thou talk'st to one of that disastrous mood
Whose mind no longer master of itself
Acts not its resolve. Seer! I am bound
To deeds that shock my nature. 'Tis most horrible!
Turn this to stone, (striking his breast) that, at the name of mother
Sheds drops of blood, and I will do the deed!                                          (falls on the altar. CALCHAS —(after a pause.)
'Tis He—the long expected— (aside) 'tis th'avenger.
Thou must perform, unquestion'd, heavn's command ORESTES —(rising gradually almost to frenzy.)
Prophets may speak, and Oracles pronounce
“So move”—“this deed be done”—“'tis Heavn's command”—
But they forget that the poor instrument
[Page 175]

To execute that will, is Man, weak Man.
[100]   Rocks, at the call divine, leap from their base,
Earth, at the word, deep to its centre shakes,
The sea, and the wing'd storm, and fiery bolt
Wait but a nod. Be these the instruments
To execute heavn's vengeance on the world.
But let not man be urg'd to shed man's blood.
What, if the guilt of an abandon'd woman
That slew her husband, calls down signal vengeance!
Must the son plunge a dagger in the heart
Of her who bore him? CALCHAS.
                                         Aid inspiring Jove!
Offspring of Agamemnon, Troy's great conqueror,
Orestes!— ORESTES.
                                         How—Orestes! why thus call
A wandering stranger, a lost wretch unknown? CALCHAS —(with enthusiastic dignity.)
I know thee—know thou me—'tis Calchas speaks.

I, I, the minist'ring Priest, stood at the altar:
This consecrated blade I hold before thee
Gleam'd in my hand, descending swift in act
To pierce the proffer'd bosom of thy sister,
Whom Agamemnon to Diana's shrine
Had led, his first-born, Iphigene, to slaughter.
The virgin knelt beneath me, and to heav'n
Look'd up with fearless eye. Before me, bow'd
The father, in his mantle veil'd from sight.
[125]   I heard his groan: deep as the groan of death.
The father felt: the chief of Greece obey'd.
Taught by thy father, son, obey the Gods.
Fir'd by thy sister— ORESTES —(seising his dagger.)
                                         Seer—'tis done—thy dagger! CALCHAS.
This never shall be stain'd with human blood.
It flashes on my mind. Thy zeal transports thee.
Hast thou forgotten it? not this the blade—
[Page 177]

Heav'n, in fit time, will arm thee with a weapon
Forg'd for the dead.— ORESTES —(full of horror.)
                                         'Tis true—the very blade,
(Said it not so?) with which she slew my Father.
So spake the Pythian: and that none, save that,
And trusted to me by a mother's hand
Must do its office. How shall I obtain it? CALCHAS.
Go forth—thou shalt possess it—now delay not.
Go to thy father's tomb, invoke his shade:
There fate's portentous sign shall fix thy doom.
If unappeas'd the spirit claim revenge,
Strike, without dread—farewell.— ORESTES.

Loathsome to sense. And, lo! the earth beneath
Peel'd bare, as if the lightning, in its passage
Had scath'd it, marking out to unborn ages

Which finds its only solace in the tear
That falls upon the dust of one most lov'd.— ORESTES —(aside to Pylades.)
How shall I act? ELECTRA.
                     Thus—on my knee— ORESTES.
                                         Oh rise! ELECTRA.
Consent, I pray—the tears steal down thy cheek!
[Page 182]

Oh youth! thou can'st not now refuse my pray'r. ORESTES —(to Pylades.)
Rise—take it!—Friend! these gushing tears betray me— PYLADES.
[200]   Be firm! 'twere dangerous to reveal the truth.— ELECTRA —(clasping the urn.)
Orestes! oh my brother! oh sole cause
For whom I have sustain'd year after year
The ills of loath'd existence! Thou art gone!
Thou too hast lest me! lest me, rest of hope,
To shed lone tears that bathe th'unfeeling urn.
Was it for this I snatcht thee from the cradle
When keen-ey'd murther thirsted for thy blood?
I rescued thee that thou in manhood's strength
Might rise th'avenger of a father's death:
Rise, the restorer of a glorious race
Which sprung from Jove! here, here, alas! thou liest.
While yet my hand has strength to hold the urn,
Oh while my lips now press the farewell kiss,
Strike, strike me dead, kind Heav'n! and thou, oh stranger!
[Page 183]

(I have no kin, no friend, no brother left)
Here place Electra.—Blest alone in this,
That death unites her ashes with Orestes.— ORESTES —(bursting from Pylades.)
I will not be restrain'd—thou hast a Brother.
Behold Orestes here.— ELECTRA.
                                         Thou—thou—Orestes! ORESTES.
Behold this well-known sign.— ELECTRA.
                     Oh!                                          (shrieks. ORESTES.
                                         Trust the oath
Of vengeance breath'd on Agamemnon's tomb. ELECTRA —(rushing to his arms.)
[225]   I trust my heart—and do I hold thee living?
Oh, let me gaze on thee, thou godlike youth!
Clasp thee again! oh let me feel once more
The pressure of thy arms, and thy warm breath
[Page 184]

That pours new life within me. ORESTES.
                                         Oh, my sister!
And is it thus we meet? how pale thy cheek!
Oh thou hast suffer'd much! ELECTRA.
                                         'Tis all forgotten—
Oh, golden light of day! and thou great Jove!
Hear my exulting voice! PYLADES —(interrupting her.)
                                         Restrain, Electra!
These shouts of clamorous joy— ELECTRA.
                                         What envious stranger
Dares interrupt my transport? ORESTES.
                                         Look on him—
'Tis Pylades—my friend. ELECTRA.
                                         My second brother!
[Page 185]

Thou com'st to share our triumph. PYLADES.
                                         Oh restrain
Thy transport—much I fear— ELECTRA —(interrupting him.)
                                         What cause for fear?
Doubt'st thou success will crown us? 'tis Orestes!
Who can oppose him? so stood Hercules
When the Nemæan lion gasp'd beneath him. ORESTES.
[250]   This is no hour of triumph—cease Electra!
This is the dreadful crisis mark'd by fate.
My Pylades! thou know'st that none on earth,
Save Agamemnon's offspring, must be present
When I invoke his shade, and claim the signal,
Dread harbinger of vengeance. PYLADES.
                                         I must leave thee— ORESTES.
To Calchas go—there, in due time, expect me.— (Exit.)
[Page 186]

Electra, hear! nor interrupt my words,
How strange soe'er— ELECTRA.
                                         Speak—not the dead more silent— ORESTES.
It fits thee, but in part, and briefly, now,
To know how past my youth:—let this suffice:
Such lore, as suits a monarch, Strophius gave.
When the first down began to shade my cheek,
(A few fleet months now past) Strophius reveal'd
My birth, till then unknown; and at the shrine
Of Phœbus, bade me from the God enquire
My future fate—I went—a voice thus hail'd me.
“Son of a murder'd Father! thine to slay
“The slayers—they, by fraud, the chieftain smote.
“By fraud they perish. At thy twentieth year”
(Complete this day, e'en this, on which they hold
The feast of blood)—“to Argos go, thyself,
“The bearer of the tale that speaks thee dead.
[275]   “At midnight—in the bath—on the same spot
[Page 187]

“Where bled Atrides—with the self-same weapon,
“That steel with which the wife her husband slew,
“Son, pierce thy mother's bosom”—at the word
I swoon'd—Electra— (she seems fainting.) ELECTRA.
                                         I am sick at heart— ORESTES.
Oh thou hast more to hear, more dreadful far! ELECTRA.
'Tis past—proceed— ORESTES.
                                         A voice of thunder rous'd me—
“Mortal! if thou dispute the will of heav'n,
“Hear thy dread sentence—thou shalt roam o'er earth
“Stranger to man. No house shall give thee shelter:
“No hospitable board afford thee food:
“The rock thy resting-place: thy fellowship
“With beasts of prey: foul leprosy shall eat
“Thy life, by lingering pangs slow worn away.”
[Page 188]
ELECTRA —(highly agitated.)
Brother, thou shalt obey. They knew not mercy. ORESTES.
I dare not disobey—Look here, (shews his arm) Electra! ELECTRA.
'Tis horrible— ORESTES.
                                         And ne'er to be effac'd
But by the gushing blood of her who bore me— ELECTRA.
Thrice, thrice she struck the blow, without remorse—
What follow'd, quickly speak— ORESTES.
                                         With shuddering awe
I bow'd, and touch'd the altar—then the voice
[300]   Spake as before. “To Argos, go, invoke
“Thy Father's shade: if, unappeas'd, the manes
“Claim justice, the fixt statue on his tomb
“Shall thrice, in sign of vengeance, wave his spear.”
[Page 189]
ELECTRA —(starting up.)
Shade of my Father! rise, and save Orestes.
Begin the invocation.— ORESTES.
                                         Yet—my sister!— ELECTRA.
Why this delay? ORESTES.
                                         I have a secret grief.
I dread to utter it— ELECTRA.
                                         Confide in me. ORESTES.
He knows it not, the friend, the bosom friend,
Who reads my heart—I would not shock his soul.
He, He, perhaps, would fly this fated wretch.— ELECTRA.
Electra never—by our Father's spirit
Who watches o'er us, I conjure thee, speak.—
[Page 190]
ORESTES.
Know, when my mother bleeds (so spake the voice)
Her furies from that hour shall goad me on,
(Rendering each day a curse, each night unholy,)
From land to land, 'till back to Greece I bring
From Tauris' shrine, with blood of strangers stain'd,
One sacred to Diana—this was utter'd:
And, that of all on earth, but One alone
Should watch my flight, and tend me at the hour
When Furies howl around me— ELECTRA.
[325]                                            Lo! that one.
Mid direst woe, the Furies howling round,
Rendering each day a curse, each night unholy,
I, I, will tend thee; and my soul shall feel it
Bliss, all that earth can give. For thou, my Brother,
Wilt on this sheltering bosom rest thy brow:
And, when, at intervals, peace sooths thy soul,
Thou too wilt turn a kindred eye on mine,
[Page 191]

And kindly look on me—delay no more.
Begin the invocation.— ORESTES.
                                         Now, Electra,
Gaze on the statue with unshrinking eye.
I dare not trust my senses. If it stir,
In silence follow me—Shade of my Father!
If unappeas'd thy manes:—if the blood
Of those who slew thee shall be shed for thine,
If 'tis thy awful mandate that the son
Should slay his mother—                                          (Mid peals of thunder and flashes of lightning the Statue waves the spear, and a voice cries “Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance.”)

ACT IV. SCENE 1st. —The Temple of Jupiter. CALCHAS.
The light'ning flash'd—the Spirit claims revenge—
Dark prophecies, of old obscurely veil'd
Flash on the sight—the son shall slay his mother!
Soul of the guilty! melt with fear! shake earth!
While Justice from her adamantine throne
Looks down, and says, “Be done.”— PYLADES enters.
                                         Some danger low'rs.—
They are not at the tomb—forlorn Orestes
Who shall protect thee now? CALCHAS.
                                         —The pow'r who sent him.
Wait thou the destin'd time— PYLADES.
                                         Yet, Seer! reflect,
The horrors of the scene, the gloom of death,
[Page 193]

The invocation of a vengeful spirit,
The call and summons to a mother's murder,
And that portentous signal which confounds
The faculties of man: these, singly, shake
Minds of firm texture: and combin'd 'gainst one
Of soul so deeply agonis'd, at once
May o'erturn reason.—Hah!                                          (seeing Arcas enter.) ARCAS.
                                         Time-honor'd Calchas.— PYLADES.
Ha!—can it be?—thou never hast betray'd us— ARCAS.
They might have torn my body, limb by limb,
These lips were clos'd for ever. PYLADES.
[25]                                            What preserv'd thee? ARCAS.
The visible arm and agency of heav'n.— CALCHAS.
Hear, son of Strophius!
[Page 194]

And, in still reverence bow before the Gods. PYLADES.
Relate what pass'd. ARCAS.
                                         I stood before Ægisthus.
'Twas noontide: bright the sun, the monarch rode
In pomp of triumph. Then while loud his slaves
Shouted “Behold a God,” from cloudless heav'n
Jove shot the lightning down, and all was still. CALCHAS.
They knew not what it meant—I watch'd the bolt
That flash'd portentous, as the answ'ring spirit
Claim'd vengeance. ARCAS.
                                         Unappall'd, the tyrant rag'd:
Again the lightning struck, his steeds transfixt
Fell breathless. On his seat the monarch leapt
Upright: his rent robes flutter'd, and his hair
Stream'd loosely, sing'd with flame: but, in his eye
Pride glow'd, and indignation: and his brow
[Page 195]

Uplifted, hurl'd defiance 'gainst the God.
He mock'd at heav'n, and earth: and, at the sight
Of me in chains, smil'd in contemptuous mood,
And bad me join the feast. Attendant enters.
                                         Prophet! Ægisthus
Now summons thee. CALCHAS.
[50]                                            Say, I attend. Go, thou—                                          (To Arcas.)
Murderer! I will confront thee, and each word
Of prescient truth, to every ear, but thine,
Shall mark thy imminent death! Electra , and Orestes close veil'd, enter. PYLADES.
                                         Electra here!
Why thus close veil'd? (to Orestes.) why this mysterious silence? ELECTRA. —(to Pylades.)
Speak to him. (to Orestes.) 'Tis thy friend—'tis Pylades.
[Page 196]
ORESTES.
Bid him avoid me—say is Calchas here? PYLADES.
Orestes! look upon me— ORESTES.
                                         Touch me not—
Away—unveil not this devoted head. PYLADES.
Come to my arms. ORESTES.
                                         My touch conveys pollution— PYLADES.
Whate'er thy doom, 'tis mine— ORESTES —(uncovering himself.)
                                         Let all avoid me:
This head is self-devoted to the Furies. PYLADES.
What words are these? explain their awful meaning.
Wilt thou not speak?
[Page 197]
ORESTES.
                                         I dare a nameless deed:
And now fate summons to a conference,
That more than death appals me. PYLADES.
                     Oh! ORESTES.
                                         Nay sigh not—
No pitying sigh, no sound of soothing voice
Must now be heard by me. Such sounds would melt me.
[75]   I have held conference with a form of night:
My powers, each sense, and living faculty,
My soul, and its affections, all are bound
To beings that inhabit other worlds:
To this estrang'd and dead—Calchas! prepare
The solemn rites— CALCHAS.
                     Come. ORESTES —(going, turns back.)
                                         Pylades—Electra—
[Page 198]
ELECTRA.
Oh brother!—brother! PYLADES.
                                         More than life belov'd! ORESTES.
Friend! Sister! Oh I dare not say—farewel!                                          (Exit with Calchas. PYLADES.
Selected minister of Jove! farewel! ELECTRA.
Avenger of a murther'd sire! farewel!
He hears, and waves me back—I now may weep—
Thou, whom I look on with a sister's eye,
Oh think not harshly of me, that a woman
Excites to vengeance—bear with me, I pray—
My heart is overcharg'd, and I have never
Found friendly ear, wherein I dar'd to breathe,
The whisper of a woe— PYLADES.
                                         You see a brother—
[Page 199]
ELECTRA.
Not nature, but dire wrongs have steel'd Electra.
Thou heard'st his words; each sense, and faculty,
His soul, and his affections (so he spake)
Were dead to earth, estrang'd from human kind.
[100]   And wherefore dead to earth? alas! his spirit
Had commun'd with th'unearthly—with whom then
Has lorn Electra commun'd? kindred beings?
Had I a mother? no—a murthress rear'd me.
What love? what cares? what counsel? what example
Such as debase the soul, to vilest passions
Give brute excess: such as to name, shall never
Pollute my virgin lip. PYLADES.
                                         I pity thee— ELECTRA.
No pity—spare me that—I am high soul'd—
How else had I existed? how sustain'd
While youth decay'd, year after year, to see
A base adulterer in Atrides' robes,
[Page 200]

O'er me extend the sceptre of my race,
And when a tear gush'd forth, insult my woe?
Hear him revile my father's memory:
And, if I look'd but stern, bid Phrygian slaves
Chain my free hands? so have I liv'd for vengeance—
Dread, unexampled vengeance. PYLADES.
                                         Such dire wrongs
Pass human sufferance. Would I might assist thee! ELECTRA.
Thou can'st assist me—thou like one from heav'n
Can'st soothe Electra. PYLADES.
                                         Can this dagger aid thee! ELECTRA.
Brave youth! Orestes' arm is strongly nerv'd—
[125]   From thee I ask no act of blood, but one
Of unexampled kindness— PYLADES.
                                         Speak thy wish.
[Page 201]
ELECTRA.
Hear then—Orestes nurst a woe in secret,
That prey'd upon his mind: from thee withheld,
Kindly withheld, lest it should shock thy nature:
Or, in th'unguarded transport of affection,
Bind thee in fellowship of woe with him
To nameless sufferings— PYLADES.
                                         Unkind Orestes! ELECTRA.
The Oracle decreed—
E'en from the moment that he strikes the murthress,
Her persecuting Furies should pursue him,
'Till from the Tauric shrine he bring to Greece
One sacred to Diana—in his flight,
Mid the wild ravings of a mind distraught,
This too was told—“that one of all who live
“Alone should tend his woe.” PYLADES.
                                         Jove here my vow!
[Page 202]

That charge be mine! ELECTRA.
                                         Not if Electra live;
But, what the issue of this day of blood
Who who can tell? when danger calls Orestes
I shall not stand aloof—if there I perish
Remember thou thy oath— PYLADES.
[150]                                            'Tis seal'd in heav'n. ELECTRA.
Farewel heroic youth! live thou renown'd
The theme of future ages! at the name
Of Pylades, let friendship hail the sound,
And tears, like mine, from glowing transport gush—                                          (Exeunt. SCENE changes to Clytemnestra's apartment. CLYTEMNESTRA. (walking to and fro in apparent agitation.)
The stranger youth! he comes not! Phedra left him
Unmindful of the passing revellers
[Page 203]

Lone in the outward court—she bad him enter,
Said, that I thrice had summon'd him: He groan'd,
And seem'd most loath to come!—why loth to come?
And whence these throbs portentous at my heart,
As if the soul unknowing what the woe
Gave presage of misfortune?—Ha! I hear
Their tread—they come—oh how they linger! sure
I catch their echoed voices— PHEDRA —(behind the scenes.)
                                         Here—I pray thee
Enter—why turn away? ORESTES —(behind the scenes.)
                                         Oh horror! horror! CLYTEMNESTRA. (rushing out, returns leading in Orestes—Phedra follows.)
Here—here—why this reluctance? thou, keep watch,
Strict watch, that none approach: no curious ear
Lurk nigh this chamber—hence— (Phedra goes) —none hear us now.
Why this repugnance, youth?
[Page 204]
ORESTES.
                                         Let me depart. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Why dost thou tremble, stranger? ORESTES.
                                         Grief—deep grief
[175]   Breeds strange confusion. I would fain depart— CLYTEMNESTRA —(stopping him.)
Stay youth, thou must not hence—thou fear'st, perhaps,
I shall regard thee with ungracious eye,
For that thy voice, to Clytemnestra, first
Spoke of Orestes' death. ORESTES.
                                         That, doubtless, that
To common minds were cause to cleave the heart,
Did not a mother hear those piercing words
“Thy Son is dead?” CLYTEMNESTRA —(reluctantly.)
                                         He would have murther'd me?
[Page 205]
ORESTES.
A mother!—and a son!—oh horrible—
'Tis a sad strife for blood! CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         I slew him not. ORESTES.
Not him—but— CLYTEMNESTRA —(highly agitated.)
                     Stranger! ORESTES.
                                         Well—thy wish, thy wish—
What would'st thou with me? CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         I would win thy favour. ORESTES.
Oh! CLYTEMNESTRA.
                     Why that groan? ORESTES.
                                         We all have secret griefs—
[Page 206]

Briefly disclose thy wish, and let me hence—
For I have that deep woe within my soul
That other's misery can claim no part. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Would I could sooth thy grief, as thou can'st mine!
[200]   To thee I must my inmost heart unbosom—
For tho' thy brow be stern, and strange thy look,
Youth is the time when sympathising pity
Most sways the yielding bosom—thou art young,
And misery, such as mine, will touch thy soul.— ORESTES.
Oh! oh! CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         If thus thy groan, ere thou hast heard it,
Ah! what—when utter'd—Youth! thou see'st before thee,
No queen resplendent in the pomp of pow'r,
Her high soul swelling o'er with boundless bliss.
The wretch, whose cry has never reach'd my ear,
The unfed beggar, shivering at my gate
[Page 207]

Is far more blest than I!—He, at the close
Of each sad day, in rest of sleep, may find
Relief from woe: and revel in the dream
That lifts him o'er this world's unequal lot
To feast with Jove—my dream is of the dead—
Of spirits howling in eternal torture—
And when I rise,
'Tis from the bed of visionary horrors
To feel them real—pity, sooth, relieve me!
Fate has decreed that thou of all mankind
Alone can'st free me— ORESTES.
                     —I!— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Thou know'st it well— ORESTES.
[225]   I know it— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Turn not thus thy looks away—
Here look on me, and as my eye meets thine,
Give answer—
[Page 208]
ORESTES.
                                         Gaze not on me—I will answer— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Has not an oracle been heard by thee? ORESTES.
'Tis certain.—I have heard prophetic sounds. CLYTEMNESTRA.
Calchas forewarn'd me—wilt thou not relieve me?
Thy heart is like thy brow: but I have gifts
That shall persuade assent. ORESTES.
                                         Gifts!—bribes—to me—
For this!— CLYTEMNESTRA —(in rage.)
                                         And, I have pow'r, unbounded pow'r,
That shall enforce compliance— ORESTES —(full of horror.)
                                         Force!—beware— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Thy pale cheek flashes with unwonted fire:
[Page 209]

Again, resistless shudders shake thy frame.
Nay—fear not—let compassion touch thy heart!
Hear, innocent youth! thou know'st not what it is:
Thou hast no stain of blood upon thy soul.
Could'st thou conceive!—no—none but murtherers can,
The tortures that await them!—I have felt them—
I have giv'n answer at the dead of night
To tongueless calls: my couch has been beset
With shapeless forms: the Furies of the slain
[250]   Have toss'd their torches round me, and their locks
Knotted with adders— ORESTES.
                                         Cease—my brain's on fire—
Oh spare me! spare me! CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Meet me on—the spot—
Down from thy brow big drops in horror roll—                                          (Orestes fixes his eyes on a dagger in the apartment.)
Why are thine eyes fix'd on yon glittering scabbard?
[Page 210]
ORESTES.
Spak'st thou not now of gifts?—give me that dagger,
And I will meet thee at the destin'd place.— CLYTEMNESTRA.
I have rare gems and gold—those shall reward thee:
That steel is nothing worth— ORESTES.
                                         Give me that dagger—
I'll meet thee on the spot— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Why strangely prize it?— ORESTES.
What! is it strange that man to battle bred
Should value a man's weapon? one, perhaps
That grac'd 'mid wond'ring chiefs, Atrides' side.
Refuse it, death in tortures ne'er shall daunt me. CLYTEMNESTRA —(gives it.)
Thou know'st not with what blade I arm thy hand. ORESTES —(full of horror.)
There is no blood on thee, thou shining steel!                                          (aside, drawing the blade.

Swear thou wilt meet Ægisthus— ORESTES —(ardently interrupting her.)
                     Aye— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         And me,
At midnight—where— ORESTES.
                                         Nay, nay, I know it all—
[275]   In the blood-sprinkled bath.— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         By oath confirm it.— ORESTES.
An oath too!—by my Father's memory! CLYTEMNESTRA —(gives him two keys.)
Take these—this guards the passage—this, the bath—
Be there—and watch the tread of foot;—if mine,
This hand shall at the portal give the signal—
That heard, admit me.—

Deem not that stern Ægisthus' summons mov'd me
To join the feast of murther. PYLADES.

Shall aid, alone shall sooth his frantic woe.                                          (as they are going out they meet Electra. ELECTRA.

This is fit place! no voice is heard—no tread
Breaks on this noiseless gloom—I saw the sun
Go calmly down—Yet—once—('tis said) the God
Turn'd back with horror from Thyestes' feast.
Of kindred blood, I dare a kindred deed—
Let me not dwell on't. 'Tis not yet the hour.
Yon clouds, that gather o'er me, thickly veil
All that has form and hue in deepest gloom!
Man sees not Man. The outward beam is dim—
Yet, ah! more clearly the internal light
Glares on the thought close-shrouded in the soul.
I hear a step. ELECTRA enters.
                     Orestes! oh where art thou? ORESTES.
                                         It is her voice!—
[Page 216]
ELECTRA.
                                         Who speaks?—Orestes! answer— ORESTES.
I would this had not been! ELECTRA.
                                         'Tis he—my brother. ORESTES.
I look'd not for this meeting. My intent
[50]   Is fixt—I shun all human intercourse.
Depart—I pray— ELECTRA.
                                         If 'tis thy wish—I go—
But—thus to part in fearful ignorance!— ORESTES.
Thou wilt not then with woman's pity melt me?— ELECTRA.
Fix on thy heart thy hand, and count its beats,
Then question mine—our aim, our souls are one—
I will not vex thee with vain strife of words,
Turning thy spirit from its great intent:
[Page 217]

But if thou hold my blood allied to thine,
Confide in me— ORESTES —(shewing the dagger.)
                                         I have the dagger—here— ELECTRA.
Enough— ORESTES.
                     And I have vow'd— ELECTRA.
                     What vow?— ORESTES.
                                         At midnight
To meet her at the bath— ELECTRA.
                                         Th'adulterer with her? ORESTES.
He shall not 'scape—'tis likewise fix'd, that I
Go, ere the hour—these (the keys) give me entrance—then
At signal, I admit them—
[Page 218]
ELECTRA.
                                         So far, well!—
But— ORESTES.
                     Why this pause? ELECTRA.
                                         Thou goest not there alone— ORESTES.
[75]   I want no aid—oh be my heart but firm
This arm dreads no resistance. ELECTRA.
                                         None shall aid thee.
The son of Agamemnon shall alone
Claim, vindicate, and wear his father's honors—
But the dread deed is destin'd in the place
Where bled thy father—at the hour he fell— ORESTES.
I know it—aye, and justly so ordain'd— ELECTRA.
There thou must lonely wait th'appointed time.
[Page 219]
ORESTES.
Well— ELECTRA.
                                         How shall pass the dreary interval?
No light has glanc'd on that accursed spot
Since there he bled— ORESTES.
                                         A lamp dispels the gloom— ELECTRA.
To witness what? the robe which shrouded him,
Thrice rent, where each deep stroke did pierce his heart.
Thou wilt have leisure time: for what? to gaze on
The brazen bath crusted with unwash'd stains:
To count the drops of blood that spot the floor:
And gather, one by one, wherever scatter'd,
Each hair, with blood distain'd, rent from his head
In the last struggle when he gasp'd for breath. ORESTES.
Thou shak'st my soul.
[Page 220]
ELECTRA.
                                         And thou wilt hear his groan
As the adulteress smote him: and his moan
[100]   That feebly murmur'd “mercy,” when she seiz'd him,
So that he stirr'd not underneath the hand—
These, and lone brooding o'er the vengeful blow
May, haply, none, none near thee— ORESTES —(seizing her arm.)
                                         Cease! Electra,
Come! let us go together— ELECTRA.
                                         Thus, Orestes,
Thus join'd, all, all will prosper. ORESTES.
                                         Be thou present!
Shade of my father! rise! and claim revenge—                                          Exeunt.
[Page 221]
SCENE—The Palace. Clytemnestra and Phedra . PHEDRA.
Loud rung their mirth—before I reach'd the hall
The tumult met my ear: I scarce could pass
The press of guests that round Ægisthus clamor'd.
I spake thy words, and much I wonder, Queen!
That thus he lingers— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Few are found, who quit
With willing speed, the feast and crouded banquet
At misery's call. And yet, methinks, Ægisthus
Had hasten'd when I urg'd. You spake my words! PHEDRA.
When I drew near him, his bow'd head hung o'er
A heavy goblet charg'd with wine. I rous'd him,
And thrice repeated what thou spak'st—he heard,
And gave (forgive the utterance) slow assent— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Reluctantly comply'd!—you misconceiv'd—
[Page 222]

You importun'd him rudely at the banquet—
[125]   He comes—it is himself—leave us— (exit as Ægisthus enters)
                                         Ægisthus!
Why this delay? know, I have lonely groan'd
In restless expectation. ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Clytemnestra
Thou should'st have join'd our revels— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         What! to smile
On flattering fools, regardless of my doom,
When boding visitations summon me
To fate's uncertain issue? thou hast heard
The supernatural vision— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Woman's fears!— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Light-hearted man! when Clytemnestra shakes
No brood of idle fancy floats before her—
The shape I saw was palpable as thine.
[Page 223]

Laugh with thy slaves—to me give serious heed.
The banquet and the bowl awhile forget:
I claim that strict observance which the cause
Imperiously demands— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Speak—I attend— (a laugh and festal shout are heard.)
Heard'st thou that shout? I would the shape that scar'd thee
Might dare confront our feasters— CLYTEMNESTRA —(with highest indignation.)
                                         'Twas—Atrides— (Ægisthus starts back.)
Aye—start—the grapes thick fumes o'ercloud thy brain.
But I will rouse thee to thy native terror.
[150]   When answering torches on from Mount to Mount,
From Ida's crest to Argos, spake that Troy
Was levell'd, and the lord of Greece, the conqueror,
The son of Atreus, Agamemnon, sped
In triumph to his realm: Who then preserv'd thee?
[Page 224]
ÆGISTHUS.
Forbear— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         In prostrate guise, thou call'd'st on me.
I struck the warrior low. Thou stood'st aloof—
I sav'd, I wedded, I first hail'd thee, King— ÆGISTHUS.
Forbear—I will obey thee— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Mark at least,
Not mine the wreck of peace, of fame, of virtue,
For base ingratitude—be what thou wilt
But not ungrateful. ÆGISTHUS.
                                         How can I assist thee?
Thy will is mine. CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Thus—'tis decreed above,
That from the youth, who bore Orestes' urn,
[Page 225]

I claim deliverance from these madd'ning horrors.
The mystery of fate is known to him.
And ere two hours are past, the time is mark'd,
At midnight—in the Bath—where fell Atrides,
I meet the youth: thou too must join my steps—
Delay not when I call. ÆGISTHUS.
                                         I now am ready.
[175]   Let us prevent his step. CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Hast thou no fear? ÆGISTHUS.
The place I fear not: nor that beardless youth— CLYTEMNESTRA.
Thou hast no weapon with thee—this at least
Were prudent, to go arm'd— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Give me thy dagger. CLYTEMNESTRA.
The youth requested it.—
[Page 226]
ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Thou—trust that dagger
To one scarce known to thee! well—'tis the hand
That gives the steel its worth—I will go arm'd—
Fear not—I will protect thee— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         Thou protect me!
Oh be but with me! go—and if thou feast,
Avoid excess—be ready at the summons.                                          (Exeunt. SCENE changes to a magnificent banqueting-room, thronged with guests, and sumptuously decorated. Musicians, Singers, &c. &c. Phanor —Guests. PHANOR.
'Tis but a transient absence—on his brow
Low'rd discontent—the king was loath to leave us.
Our mirth shall chase his gloom. On his return,
Swift at his entrance, wake the lyre and flute,
And raise the festive chorus—Lo! he comes.
[Page 227]
ÆGISTHUS enters.                                          (instruments and voices strike up saluting him.) PHANOR.
Hail monarch!—hail!—                                          (choral song.) ÆGISTHUS.
                                         —I greet you all—most welcome—
The intervening moments, which, like clouds
Crossing the sun, broke rudely on our mirth,
By shew of grateful contrast, give new zest
And relish to enjoyment—Welcome all.— PHANOR.
[200]   Monarch of Argos! hail! ÆGISTHUS.
                                         This fits th'occasion—
My spirits, with redoubled ardor, rush
To swell your transport—fill again the bowl.
That strain once more—                                          (chorus is repeated.)
Fling wide the palace gates—the wond'ring strangers
Shall gaze on our magnificence—say, Phanor,
Where is the Prophet?—him I bade attend;
[Page 228]

His oft-repeated threat will raise our mirth—
Looks this like heav'n's displeasure? Where the strangers
That met us in our triumph?— PHANOR.
                                         —They attend.
We but delay'd, Ægisthus, 'till thy nod
Gave sign of entrance.— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Let them now advance— Enter Pylades and Arcas . PHANOR.
Make way, make way. PYLADES.
                                         I pray thee, leave us here— ÆGISTHUS.
Who speaks?— PHANOR.
                     The stranger Phocians— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Forward lead them.
[Page 229]

Look! how they gaze, in speechless wonder lost. PHANOR.
The gorgeous majesty of Argos, dazzles
The unaccustom'd eye— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Your Phocian feasts
Are poor to these? PYLADES.
[225]                                            No—our's—are holy banquets
Whereon the Gods look down—not feasts of blood. PHANOR.
Lo! Calchas comes—                                          (as the Prophet slowly advances, the scene gradually darkens.) ÆGISTHUS.
                                         Where is the hoary Prophet? PHANOR.
What strange obscurity o'erclouds the banquet? ÆGISTHUS.
I scarce can see his face!—give me thy torch—
[Page 230]

Why dost thou gaze so fixedly upon me?                                          (to Calchas.) CALCHAS.
The tears gush down thy cheek!—thou see'st them not—
Thy groans—ill-fated wretch! thou hear'st them not— ÆGISTHUS.
Are these thy wonted threat'nings? CALCHAS.
                                         —I speak none—
Dread what the heav'ns denounce!                                          (violent thunder and lightning.) PHANOR.
                                         The arch'd vault shakes! ÆGISTHUS.
Methinks I sit like Jove enthron'd 'mid Gods,
While lightnings sport beneath me!—                                          (the guests disperse in much confusion.) CALCHAS.
                                         Impious wretch! PHANOR.
How shall we 'scape? the roof is cop'd with flames.
[Page 231]

Round every column streams the lightning's blaze. ÆGISTHUS. (flinging away the bowl, which he had lifted to his lips.)
Fill me another bowl—This tastes of blood—                                          (pours out a mock libation.)
This is our wonted offering to the shade
Of slain Atrides— (the voice that spoke at the tomb is heard.)
                                         Vengeance! vengeance! vengeance! Attendant on Clytemnestra enters.
King! Clytemnestra calls— ÆGISTHUS.
                                         I haste— CALCHAS.
To death—                                          (Exeunt. SCENE the vaults leading to the bath. Orestes and Electra . ORESTES.
[250]   I am prepar'd for all—take thou the lamp.
[Page 232]

So: hold the light. These locks by time encrusted
Will not give way.                                          (his hand trembles, that he cannot rightly direct the key.) ELECTRA.
                                         It is thy hand that trembles.
Give me the key. The springs resist not—now                                          (the door opens.)
Force back the iron grate—why dost thou start?
This way—thy hand, Orestes—follow me— ORESTES.
'Tis loathsome as the charnel-house.                                          (he lingers, and turns away.) ELECTRA.
                                         Quick, quick,
Hasten thy step—heed not—'twill pass away— ORESTES.
The damps imprison'd in this unsun'd vault
Strike me with death-like chill—hold up the light—
'Tis midnight darkness—
[Page 233]
ELECTRA.
                     Come. ORESTES.
                                         Thy single lamp
Scarce shoots a glimmering ray athwart the gloom. ELECTRA.
Oh do not wish for more! ORESTES.
                                         I understand thee—
I shall not see her when I lift my arm—
I would not see her face— ELECTRA.
                                         Banish these thoughts— ORESTES —(in the utmost horror.)
Oh sister! if her eye should glance on mine!                                          (in passing on, he strikes his foot against the brazen bath.)
What's this, which as I struck it unawares
Did loudly ring, and vibrate 'gainst my foot?—
[Page 234]
ELECTRA.
Oh ask not! pass this way— ORESTES.
[275]                                            Ah! 'tis the bath
In which he perish'd! quick, take back the light— ELECTRA.
This way—here wait, shrouded in thickest gloom— ORESTES —(starting forward in extreme agitation.)
Hah! seest thou not? ELECTRA.
                     What moves thee? ORESTES.
                                         'Mid the darkness
There, there, it dimly gleams—unclasp my hand— ELECTRA —(vainly attempting to hold him.)
Why dost thou struggle from me! ORESTES.
'Tis the robe—                                          (seizes it.) ELECTRA.
Keep firm his brain, oh Phœbus!—
[Page 235]
ORESTES —(displaying the robe to the light.)
                                         Heav'n and Earth!
Thrice pierc'd!—and where the accursed dagger smote him,
Each rent blood-stain'd, yet marks the blow of hell—
Die murth'ress! (quite frantic) call me not “thy Son, thy Son.”
Clasp not my hand!—bare not thy breast to me—
Die murthress! lo! she falls—this hand has stab'd her.
Ha! what are ye, that from each drop of blood
Start into life? foul hags! your blazing locks
Are viper-knotted. Why thus strain tow'rds me
Your eye-balls roll'd in blood? ye shall not grasp me—
Stretch all your wings—I fly before the wind.— (He falls exhausted.) ELECTRA.
My brother!— (endeavouring to hold him in his struggles.) ORESTES.
                     Hah! ELECTRA.
                     Know'st thou not me?
[Page 236]
ORESTES.
                                         I know thee—
[300]   Thou art my mother's Fury—thou hast seiz'd me
To whirl me into Tartarus— (violently struggling) —off, off,
Down to the realms of torture— ELECTRA.
                                         Oh my brother! ORESTES —(recovering.)
Electra! ELECTRA.
                                         Lov'd Orestes! oh my brother! ORESTES.
Thou! ELECTRA.
                                         'Tis thy sister clasps thee in her arms.
These are Electra's tears that wet thy cheek. ORESTES.
Clasp me—nay closer—are they fled away? ELECTRA.
'Twas but the coinage of thy brain—
[Page 237]
ORESTES.
                                         Indeed—                                          (a noise of approaching steps.)
I hear the tread of feet—they come—they come— ÆGISTHUS —(is heard behind the scenes.)
Where is the youth that brought Orestes' urn?
Give entrance to Ægisthus— ORESTES.
                                         'Tis th'Adulterer—
I am myself again—King! enter in— (opens the door.) ÆGISTHUS —(in entering.)
Go slaves! bid Clytemnestra haste—away— ORESTES —to Electra, as Ægisthus enters.
This is a righteous blow! hold up the lamp,
That we may view each other, face to face. ÆGISTHUS —enters.
Boy! drop that lifted dagger, or thou diest—                                          (drawing his sword.) ORESTES —(stabs him.)
'Tis I, Orestes, Agamemnon's son
[Page 238]

Who smite thee to the heart— (he falls groaning.) ELECTRA.
                                         So fall the base,
Th'adulterer, and oppressor!—hark! I hear
[325]   A hasty foot—art thou prepar'd? ORESTES.
                                         Oh heav'n!
Quick, close that gate. Cast o'er this wretch the robe:
Yet faint his groan. So veil, that sight, nor sound
Give warning to her ere I strike the blow—
I would not shock her soul before the time:
Enough that this must be— ELECTRA.
                                         Is there ought else? ORESTES.
Put out thy light— (she extinguishes it) —the lamp too which she bears,
On sudden, with swift hand, extinguish it.
If but a ray break forth, this dagger drops. CLYTEMNESTRA —(knocks thrice.)
'Tis I, 'tis Clytemnestra, give me entrance—
[Page 239]
ORESTES.
Quick, quick, unbar the portal—                                          (at her entrance, Electra dashes out her lamp.) CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         What rude hand
Has seiz'd the lamp? where art thou stranger? speak—
Ægisthus? ÆGISTHUS.
                     Oh— CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         A death-groan strikes my ear—
What's this which bars my way? it is the robe
Which tangled him—there's one that stirs beneath:
And blood, warm blood, spouts thro' the heaving folds— ÆGISTHUS —(faintly.)
Fly—I am slain—Orestes' dagger pierc'd me—
He is the stranger—fly.                                          (he dies.)                                          (as she attempts to fly, Orestes seizes her with one hand, with the other holds the dagger over her.) CLYTEMNESTRA.
                                         What chill hand grasps me?
[Page 240]
ORESTES.
Thou must not live— CLYTEMNESTRA.
[350]                                            Spare me—my Son! my Son!
Strike not this breast that nurtur'd thee! have pity!—
My Son! my Son! have pity on thy mother— ORESTES —(turns his face away.)
I cannot wound her— (the voice that spoke at the tomb.)
                                         “Vengeance! vengeance! vengeance!” CLYTEMNESTRA —(shrieks.)
Oh! 'tis Atrides' voice—there is no hope—
Thus—thus—my arm shall aid thy lingering blow.                                          (seizes his arm, and rushes on the dagger.) (The curtain falls.) Back matter

[Page 5]
Main text ACT I. Scene Scene , the Royal Garden at Aranjuez. Enter Carlos and Domingo . Dom. The cheerful days enjoyed by others at Aranjuez, have had no effect upon your highness. Our abode at this delightful spot, has been of no avail. (Carlos is thoughtful and silent.) Be not thus mute, and thus mysterious, Prince. Let your heart be open to a parent's heart. No monarch can purchase, at too dear a rate, the peace and comfort of his only son. The power of Philip is extensive. If you have any wish ungratified, name it to Philip. But is this possible? I was present when due homage was paid to royal Carlos in Toledo—when princes contended for the honour of kissing his hand, and six mighty potentates at the same moment knelt to him. I saw the blood mount into his cheeks—I saw his bosom heave with great resolves.—
[Page 6]
I saw his sparkling eye wander with delight through the assembly ——yes, and his eye confessed that he was satisfied. But this deep solemn melancholy, Prince, which we with sorrow have remarked during eight months, is to each member of the court a painful mystery. Many a night of care has it caused your royal father, and many a tear has it drawn from the eyes of your mother.
Car. (Starts.) Mother!
Dom. (Surprised.) Prince!
Car. Heaven grant I may forgive the man who made her my mother!
Dom. [25]   Prince!
Car. (Recollecting himself.) Holy father, I have been unfortunate in mothers. The first act of which I was guilty, when I saw the light, was matricide.
Dom. Is it possible that your Royal Highness can allow such a reproach to dwell upon your mind?
Car. And my new mother—has she not robbed me of the little love my father felt for me? My only merit in his eyes consisted in being his only son.—She has produced a daughter.—Alas! Who can foretel what futurity may disclose?
Dom. You surely are disposed to be ironical. Her Majesty is adored by all Spain. Can it be possible that your highness alone surveys her with the eyes of hatred? Is she not the most beauteous woman on our globe? Are not her very looks royal? Is she not in the bloom of youth? Was she not to have been your bride? Impossible! Impossible! Carlos cannot hate the darling of our nation. By saying this, he contradicts himself. But though I know you are not serious, Prince, let no one, I entreat you, tell the queen her son dislikes her—it would affect her deeply.
Car. Think you it would?
Dom. If, Prince, you bear in mind the last tournament at Saragossa, you can hardly doubt it. The queen sat with
[Page 7]
the ladies of the court, surveying what passed among the combatants. [50]   Suddenly some one called “The king is wounded.” The cry was on every side repeated, till the confused report reached the Queen's ears!——“The prince!” cried she, and attempted to spring from the balcony.—“No. The king himself.”—“Send, then, for surgeons,” was her answer, while she endeavoured to regain her breath. (After a pause.) You are thoughtful.
Car. I am lost in admiration of his majesty's most merry confessor, who seems to have a store of pointed anecdote; but, (with a look of stern solemnity,) father Domingo, I have often heard that spies and vile informers have in this world done far more harm than poison or the poniard. You have taken on yourself unnecessary trouble. If you expect to be thanked, go to the king.
Dom. Your highness is right in being cautious; but proper distinctions should ever be made. Spurn not from you the friend as well as the hypocrite. My intentions are upright.
Car. Let not my father know this,—else is your disgrace certain—your hopes of the purple vain.
Dom. (Starts.) How!
Car. Why thus affect surprise? Are you not promised the first vacant see?
Dom. You mock me, Prince.
Car. Heaven forbid that I should mock the dreadful man who can declare my father blessed or damned!
Dom. [75]   I will not presumptuously attempt to dive into the cause of your mysterious melancholy. Allow me, however, to remind your highness that the church offers an asylum to every oppressed mind; that no monarch has a key to this asylum; and that even crimes are indiscoverable when sealed with the signet of the sacrament. You understand me. I need say no more.

[Page 8]
Car. Right! You need not. Far be it from me to tempt the bearer of this signet.
Dom. Prince, this suspicion——you misconstrue the intentions of your most faithful servant.
Car. (Takes his hand.) Right, again! Therefore pay no further regard to my concerns. You are a holy man—that every body knows; but, to confess the truth, you are already troubled with the cares of too many consciences. Your road, holy father, leads to St. Peter's chair. Too much knowledge might be a burthen to you on the journey. Report this to the king, who sent you hither.
Dom. Sent me hither!
Car. Such were my words, most venerable father.—Too well I know that I am betrayed at this court—that a hundred eyes are bribed to observe my every action—that king Philip has sold his only son to the basest of his subjects—that every one who reports a syllable which I have uttered, is more liberally rewarded than if he had done a virtuous [100]   action—that I——but no more of this. My heart will betray all it feels on such a subject. I have already said too much.
Dom. It is his majesty's intention to return, before the approach of evening, to Madrid. The court is already preparing for departure. Shall we have the honour, Prince—
Car. Enough!—I shall attend his majesty.                                          [Exit. Dom. Thou art worthy of compassion, Philip, worthy of it as thy son. Already I perceive that the viper Jealousy has lodged its deadly venom in thy soul. Thy luckless anxiety hastens with eagerness to make the most dreadful of discoveries, and when made, it will drive thee to distraction. Thy treasures may be exhausted—the boisterous billows may devour thy fleets—rebellion may force its way even to the steps of thy throne. All this thou may'st witness without alarm, but when—
[Page 9]
Enter Posa . Spirits of bliss! Whom do I see? My Roderigo!
Posa My Carlos! (They embrace.)
Car. Is it possible? May I believe my senses?—— Yes, yes.—'Tis he, 'tis Roderigo. I press him to my breast —I feel his heart beat against mine. All now is well again. This embrace is balsam to my wounded soul.
Posa. Your wounded soul! All now is well again! What mean you by these declarations?
Car. And what brings you from Brussels at a time that [125]   no one expected you?—How!—Can I ask? Pardon me, holy Providence, pardon the impious question. Thou didst see the unhappy Carlos, and hast sent to him his guardian angel.
Posa. Dear prince, I can return no answer to this storm of rapture, but declarations of astonishment. Little did I expect to find king Philip's son in such a state. Never did Carlos meet me with a look so dreadful. Your haggard cheeks are flushed with an unnatural glow—your feverish lips quiver, and are pale.—What must I think? This cannot be the emblem of the lion—this cannot be the bold intrepid youth, to whom a nation, grievously oppressed, has sent me—for I stand not here as Roderigo—as the companion of your early years.—No, as the ambassador of a much injured people. In their name I embrace you. It is Flanders which weeps upon your neck, and solemnly calls upon you for deliverance. The day, the dreadful day is come, which ends their liberty for ever. King Philip is resolved to plunge a poniard into the heart of Brabant. Your favourite country loses its free-born rights, if Alba, that harsh instrument of fell fanaticism, reaches the gates of Brussels with the law of Spain. The last hope of this almost despairing land, rests on the grandson of immortal Charles. If he be not affected by its sad appeal, all, all is lost.

[Page 10]
Car. Then all is lost indeed. Tears are the utmost I can [150]   offer, and them my own misery requires. Heaven has forsaken me—why should I think of others?
Posa. Carlos, I no longer know you. Is this the man whom Heaven had spared to vindicate the rights of human nature? Is this the man, who stood upright amidst the universal degeneracy of Europe, who boldly dashed from his lips the envenomed draught of popery, who defied the power of priesthood, and, in the cause of all mankind, feared not a wily king's pretended piety?
Car. Speak you of me? You are mistaken, friend. I once dreamt of a Carlos, like the man you have described— whose boiling blood would mount into his cheeks, if liberty were mentioned—but he has long been dead. The Carlos, whom you now behold, is not the man whom you took leave of, in Alkala, whose aspiring mind aimed at a knowledge of the bliss which Paradise bestows, and fondly hoped that, when upon the throne, he could transplant such bliss to Spain. The idea was childish, but oh, how heavenly!— Past is the vision, never to return.
Posa. Vision, Prince! Was it then but a vision?
Car. Let me weep; let me shed these scalding tears upon the bosom of my only friend. Far as King Philip's power extends—far as his fleets display the Spanish flag, there is no place but this where I can freely shed my tears. Oh Roderigo, I conjure you, by our mutual hopes of heavenly [175]   bliss, throw me not from your arms. (Posa bends over him with speechless emotion.) Fancy me an orphan, who has a claim on your compassion; for though I am a monarch's son, I know not what it is to have a father. Oh if the hopes which my heart cherishes be gratified, if bounteous nature formed Roderigo with the same sensations as my own, if the chords of our hearts were destined to move in mutual mild vibration, if the tear which relieves me is dearer to you than King Philip's favour—

[Page 11]
Posa. Dearer than all the world.
Car. I am become so poor and abject that I must remind you of our earlier years, and claim the debt you have owed me since that time. This debt is pure disinterested friendship. We were two wild boys, who had no cares, or nearly none, for I was only grieved to see myself so much eclipsed by you, until at length I formed the resolution of making you my friend, instead of envying you. My offer was, however, not accepted—you received my tokens of regard with coldness. Often,—though you did not see them—often have tears rolled down my cheeks, when I perceived that your regard was bestowed upon inferiors. “Why,” thought I, “why are these preferred to me? Do I not feel as sincere an esteem for him as they?”—Me you approached with cold solemnity, then knelt and said, this homage was the Prince's due.
Posa. [200]   No more of this, I pray. You confuse me.
Car. I deserved not such a forced return—such cold respect; yet though you hurt me, you could not persuade me to withdraw my proffered friendship. Thrice did you discard the Prince—thrice he returned to beg and force on you a brother's love. Chance did what Carlos was not able to effect. It happened once, when we were amusing ourselves with boyish sports, that the shuttlecock, which you had struck, flew with some force againt the eye of my aunt, the Queen of Bohemia. She thought you did it purposely, and with tears made her complaint to my father. Every one of our playmates was summoned to appear before him, that the culprit might be discovered; and the king swore he should be punished with rigour, even if he were his son. I saw you stand with fearful tremor at a distance—I approached to the king, knelt, confessed the crime was mine, and submitted to the punishment decreed.
Posa. Alas! Of what do you remind me, Prince!

[Page 12]
Car. And the punishment was inflicted, too, in the presence of the whole commiserating court. I looked at you, but did not weep. The pain was great, and my royal blood followed each barbarous stroke, but I looked at you, and did not weep. The resolution of a boy roused the king's anger. He doomed me further to atone for my offence by an imprisonment of twelve hours in a dark, dismal dungeon. [225]   Thus dearly did I pay for my obstinate determination to possess the esteem of Roderigo. When we again met, you fell at my feet and bathed my hand with tears. “Yes,” cried you, “yes, my pride is conquered. I will repay you when you mount the throne.”
Posa. (Presents his hand.) That will I, Carlos. The vow of earlier years I now confirm. I will discharge the debt I owe you. The hour of payment is perhaps at hand.
Car. It is, it is. Delay not, I beseech you. Now, even now, you can discharge the debt. I need your friendship much.
Posa. In friendship alone, dear Carlos, I will not be surpassed by Philip's son.
Car. A dreadful secret rages in my soul. No longer shall it be concealed. On Roderigo's pallid countenance I'll read the sentence of my death. Hear then—with horror hear—but do not answer me——I dote upon my mother.
Posa. Gracious God!
Car. Nay, spare me not. Speak! Confess that on this globe no one is half so wretched as myself. But no, you need not speak. I know already what would be your observations. “Dote upon your mother! The long established customs of society, the ordinance of nature, and the laws of Rome—all, all condemn this passion. It militates against [250]   your father's rights.” True. This I feel, yet still I love, although I know the path which lies before me will lead me
[Page 13]
to the scaffold or to madness. I have no hope—I know my life will be endangered by my conduct—yet still I love.
Posa. Is the Queen aware of your passion?
Car. How could I attempt to divulge it? She is the wife of Philip—she is the Queen of Spain. Guarded as she is by my father's jealousy, and surrounded by the formality of etiquette, how could I approach her without witnesses? Eight months of hopeless torture have elapsed since the king called me from the university to court. Daily has it been my destiny to hear and to behold her, and, while I panted for the liberty of speaking, to be silent. Yes. Eight months of hopeless torture have elapsed. A thousand times the dread confession has trembled on my lips, then crept with cowardly dismay back to my burning heart. Oh Roderigo, procure me a short interview without a witness—for a few moments only—but without a witness.
Posa. And your father, Carlos?
Car. Torture! Why remind me of him? Call to my recollection all the horrors which conscience can inflict, but mention not my father. For ever are the adamantine bonds of nature severed between him and me.
Posa. Hate you your father, then?
Car. No, no; but a tremor, such as is felt by culprits [275]   most abandoned, creeps through my frame, when I but hear him mentioned. Is it my fault, if the mean education he bestowed on me destroyed the affection which was taking root in my heart? I was six years old before I saw the dreadful man who was, as those around me said, my father. On that very morning, without even sitting to the table, he had signed four death-warrants. After that time I never saw him, unless summoned to be punished for some fault.— Oh heavens!—I feel the subject galls me.—No more of it!
Posa. Yes, Prince. You must now unbosom yourself. Confess every sensation of your mind—then will it be relieved.

[Page 14]
Car. Often have I contended against my own feelings— often, when the centinels have been asleep, have I at midnight knelt, with floods of tears, before my crucifix, and prayed that heaven would inspire me with filial affection; but never was I heard. Oh Roderigo, explain to me this wonderous act of Providence. Why was this man of all others doomed to be my father? Why was I doomed to be his son, when he might have had so many who are better? In all creation, Nature could not have discovered two such opposites. How could she by a tie so sacred bind to each other the extremes of all the human race? Horrible destiny! —Roderigo, in me and in my father you behold two hostile planets. Once in their course they met each other [300]   with discordant touch, and then for ever flew asunder.
Posa. I anticipate a dreadful hour.
Car. That do I also, for my mind is haunted by terrific dreams, as if the demons of despair were dancing round my couch. My spirit bends beneath their influence. My reason traverses a labyrinth of sophistry, till I at length start at the gulph which I perceive before me. Oh Roderigo, could I but cease to think he is my father—thy pallid looks declare that thou hast understood me—could I but cease to think he is my father, what were the king to me?
Posa. (After a pause.) Dare I make one request, my Carlos? Whatever you may wish to do—however violent may be your passion, promise you will not form a resolution, till you have heard the counsel of your friend. Promise me this.
Car. I promise all which you can ask; I throw myself into your arms.
Posa. The king, I hear, returns immediately to Madrid. But little time is in your power; for, if you wish to speak in private with the Queen, it must be in Aranjuez. The retirement of the country, and the banishment of form, which in some degree must take place, are in your favour.

[Page 15]
Car. Such were the hopes I cherished, but in vain.
Posa. Not entirely so. I go to be presented to her. This I should have done at all events. She, and she alone is acquainted [325]   with the secret of our friendship. If I find her such in Spain as formerly she was at Henry's court, she will have no reserve or pride. An opportunity may occur of mentioning her son.
Car. Ecstatic thought!
Posa. Her heart speaks in her looks. If in these looks I find that you may hope—if I perceive that she has no objection to the interview, and that the attendant ladies can be removed—
Car. Most of them would serve me, especially the Marchioness of Mondecar, whose son I lately made my page.
Posa. So much the better.—Be at hand, then, that, when I give a signal, you may appear.
Car. I will, I will. Haste, then, dear friend!
Posa. Yes—but what signal?—You must be at some distance. Were you too near, we should all be in danger.
Car. (After some reflection.) How if that succeeded?— It must—it will. About this time I know that she is wont to wander in the garden. All the fountains communicate with that which you will see before the Queen's pavilion. Luckily none of them are at present playing. If you by any means can open this one fountain, all the cascades will instantly burst forth. I shall then know that I am suffered to approach.
Posa. A happy thought! I will not lose a moment. [350]   Adieu, then, till we meet again.
                                         [Exeunt severally. Scene Scene changes to another part of the garden, which commands a prospect into the country. At the end of a walk is the Queen's pavilion. Enter Queen, Olivarez, Eboli , and Mondecar .
[Page 16]
Queen. I wish you to walk with me, Mondecar. The sparkling eyes of the princess have tormented me throughout the morning. Look at her, scarcely can she conceal the delight which she feels in leaving the country.
Ebo. Your majesty will excuse me, when I own that I feel a pleasure in returning to Madrid.
Mon. And is your majesty so unwilling to leave Aranjuez.
Queen. I am. This landscape is so beautiful. I feel, when here, in my own world. This place, some time ago, became my favourite residence. Here rural Nature, the bosom friend of earlier years, greets me whenever I step forth to meet her. Here I retrace my infantine delights, and here I feel the friendly breeze of France. Pardon what I say. We are all partial to our native land.
Mon. Are they so too, who are born in France?
Ebo. But how dreary, how sad and solitary it is here. I could almost imagine myself at La Trappe.
Queen. In my opinion it is the reverse. Sadness and solitude, I think, dwell in Madrid.—But what says the Duchess to this?
Oli. My opinion is that, since there were kings in Spain, it has always been the custom to pass one month here, another in the Prado, and the winter at Madrid.
Queen. Yes, Duchess, you know I am resolved never [375]   again to enter into any controversy with you.
Mon. And what life will soon be diffused through the capital! Preparations are already making for a bull-fight, and we are to be treated with an Auto da fè .
Queen. Treated! Does the gentle Mondecar express herself thus?
Mon. Why not? They who are burnt, are heretics.
Queen. I hope your sentiments are different, Eboli.
Ebo. I entreat your Majesty not to think me a worse Christian than the Marchioness.

[Page 17]
Queen. Alas! I forget where I am.—Let us converse upon some other subject. We were speaking of the country, I think. This month seems to have passed away with wonderful rapidity. I promised myself much pleasure at Aranjuez; but, alas! I have not found what I expected. Does hope deceive others as well as me?
Oli. The Princess Eboli can answer that. She has not confessed whether Gomez may cherish hope—whether we shortly shall greet her as his bride.
Queen. True—I thank you for reminding me of this. (To Eboli.) I have been entreated to sue in his behalf. But how can I do this! The man to whom I give my Eboli must be deserving of her.
Oli. Your majesty may rest assured he well deserves the Princess. He is a worthy man—a man whom our most [400]   gracious monarch honours with his royal favour.
Queen. That makes him, of course, very happy; but we must know whether he loves, and ought to be beloved. This I ask you, Eboli.
Ebo. (Is silent and confused—after a pause, during which her eyes are fixed on the earth, she falls at the Queen's feet.) Oh generous lady, have compassion on me. Let me not, for heaven's sake, let me not be sacrificed.
Queen. Sacrificed! You need say no more. Rise. Dreadful is her destiny who is doomed to be sacrificed. Rise. Is it long since you refused the count?
Ebo. Many months. Don Carlos was still at the university.
Queen. (Starts, and keenly rivets her eyes on Eboli.) Have you looked into your heart, and discovered for what reason?
Ebo. (With warmth.) Oh never can I be his—for a thousand reasons, never!
Queen. (In a very solemn tone.) More than one is too many. You cannot feel an affection for him. That is
[Page 18]
enough. Let us say no more upon the subject. (To the other ladies.) I have not yet seen the Infanta to day. Marchioness, let her be brought to me.
Oli. (Looks at her watch.) It is not yet the usual hour.
Queen. Not yet the hour when I may be a mother! That is hard. Forget not to tell me when the proper period is arrived.
Enter a Page , who whispers to Olivarez . Oli. The Marquis Posa requests your Majesty's permission—
Queen. Posa!
Oli. [425]   He is lately arrived from France and the Netherlands, and wishes to be allowed the honour of delivering letters from your royal mother.
Queen. Is this allowed?
Oli. (Scrupulously.) I must own, that, in my instructions, no mention is made of a Castilian grandee coming from a foreign court to deliver letters in the royal garden to the Queen of Spain.
Queen. I will venture, then, at my own risk.—
Oli. I hope, then, that your Majesty will allow me to withdraw.
Queen. Act as you think proper, Duchess.
                                         [Exit Olivarez. (Queen makes a sign to the Page, who goes for the Marquis.) Enter Posa . My Lord, you are welcome to Spain.
Posa. Which I never was so proud to call my native land as now.
Queen. (To Eboli and Mondecar.) Ladies, the Marquis Posa, who broke a lance with my father at the tournament
[Page 19]
of Rheims, and made my colour thrice victorious—the first of his nation who taught me that it was an honour to be Queen of Spain. (To Posa.) When we last saw each other at the Louvre, Marquis, you fancied not that you would be my guest in this part of the world.
Posa. No, great Queen; for then I little fancied France would lose to us the sole incitement to our envy.
Queen. Haughty Spaniard! The sole incitement! This [450]   to a Princess of the house of Valois!
Posa. I dare say this now, for now your majesty is our's.
Queen. Your travels have, I hear, led you through France. What tidings bring you of my honoured mother, and my much-loved brothers?
Posa. (Presents letters to her.) I found the Queen Regent indisposed, and heedless of any other gratification than that of knowing her daughter is happy on the Spanish throne.
Queen. Must she not be so, when she knows with what affection her kind relatives remember her? How sweet is it to call to mind———I understand you have travelled through many countries, in the north of Europe, and have visited many courts. You seem to have staid long in London.
Mon. (Surveys Posa with a look of curiosity.) In London!
Ebo. In London! You have seen the heretic Queen then, Chevalier? What kind of woman is she?
Posa. Almost as lovely as the Princess Eboli—upon a throne.
Ebo. Lovely!—Mondecar!
Queen. And now you are disposed to settle in your native country. You will be a greater prince within your peaceful mansion than is King Philip—more satisfied—more free —more a philosopher. I have my doubts whether Madrid will please you.—We are very——quiet in Madrid.
Posa. That is more than can be said of any other capital [475]   in Europe.

[Page 20]
Queen. I am told so. I have almost forgotten the transactions of this world, though I once thought I never should. Nothing is easier, I perceive, than to be a Queen.
Posa. Undoubtedly, to those who are born to be Queens.
Queen. (Looks with earnestness at Posa.) The world has corrupted you, Marquis. I no longer recognize in you the philosopher who boldly spoke the truth to every one.
Posa. Surely it is the boldest frankness to avow the truth, where certainly no flatterer would venture to declare it.
Queen. (To Eboli.) Princess, I think that, at a distance, I perceive a hyacinth.—Will you pluck it for me? (Eboli goes towards the place pointed to. Queen speaks in a tone somewhat lower than before.) Marquis, if I be not much deceived, your arrival will make one more happy man at court.
Posa. I have found one in a state of abject melancholy, whom nothing in this world can cheer, but—
Eboli (Returns with the flower.) Ebo. As the Chevalier has seen so many countries, his adventures have, doubtless, been many and remarkable. We may promise ourselves much entertainment from the recital of them.
Posa. You do me honour. It is, to be sure, the duty of a knight to seek adventures, and more particularly to defend [500]   the ladies.
Mon. Against giants—but now there are no giants.
Posa. Power, when opposed to the weak, is always a giant.
Queen. The Chevalier is right. There are still giants, but no knights.
Posa. But lately, on my return from Naples, I was witness
[Page 21]
of a most affecting circumstance, which happened to a worthy youth, with whom the bonds of friendship had united me.—If I were not afraid that I should be thought tedious by your majesty—
Queen. Have I any choice?—The curiosity of the Princess will not bear a refusal. Proceed, my Lord. I am fond of anecdote.
Posa. Two noble families of Mirandola, weary of the jealousy and enmity which they had inherited for centuries as partizans of the Guelphs and Gibellines, resolved to ratify an everlasting peace, by the gentle tie of marriage. Fernando, the nephew of the powerful Pietro, and the angelic Matilda, daughter of Colonna, were fixed upon for the purpose. Never did Nature form two hearts so proper to be joined— never did the world produce a couple so formed in every respect for each other. As yet Fernando had but paid his devotions to the portrait of his beauteous bride. How did he tremble with delight at the fond hope of finding her as lovely [525]   as the picture promised. In Padua, to which place he was confined by his studies, he anxiously awaited the ecstatic summons to do homage at the feet of sair Matilda, for the first time. (Queen becomes more attentive. Posa proceeds, after a short pause; and, as far as the presence of the Queen will allow it, seems as if relating the anecdote to Eboli.) Mean while the death of Pietro's wife takes place. With youthful ardour the old man listens to the universal praise of sweet Matilda. He comes—he sees—he loves. This new emotion stifles the gentler voice of nature—he declares his passion for his nephew's destined bride, and sanctifies his robbery at the altar.
Queen. And how did Fernando act?
Posa. Ignorant of the fatal change in his affairs, the intoxicated youth flew, on the wings of love, to Mirandola. The stars shone bright when his fleet steed stopped at the
[Page 22]
door of the illuminated palace. The Bacchanalian sound of cymbals and of kettle-drums assailed his ear. He alighted, and, unknown to any one, entered the magnificent saloon, where, amidst his mirthful guests, sat—Pietro, with an angel at his side,—an angel, whom Fernando knows, but whom his ardent fancy never yet had painted half so lovely. A single look tells him what he once was destined to possess—what he has lost for ever.
Ebo. Unfortunate Fernando!
Queen. Your story now is surely at an end—it must be at [550]   an end.
Posa. Not quite.
Queen. Did you not say Fernando was your friend.
Posa. I have not one whom I regard so much.
Ebo. Proceed with your anecdote, my Lord.
Posa. It is a mournful tale——and the recollection of it gives me pain—Allow me to omit the rest. (An universal pause ensues.)
Queen. (To Eboli.) Now I may surely be allowed to embrace my daughter.—Bring her hither, Princess.
                                         [Exit Eboli. (Posa gives a sign to a Page, who appears in the back ground, and instantly withdraws. Queen opens the letters which the Marquis had delivered to her, and evinces, by her looks, that she is much surprised. While she reads the letters, the Marquis converses at a distance with Mondecar. The Queen, at length, turns to Posa, and surveys him with a penetrating eye.) Queen. You have given us no account of Matilda. She knows not, perhaps, how much Fernando suffers.
Posa. No one has yet dived into the secrets of Matilda's heart; but exalted minds are silent while they suffer.
Queen. You look around. Whom do you expect to see?
Posa. It occurred to me, just now, that one whom I could name, would be most happy were he in my place.

[Page 23]
Queen. Who is to blame that he is not?
Posa. How! May I interpret this according to my wishes? Would he be pardoned if he now appeared?
Queen. (Alarmed.) Now! Now! What do you mean?
Posa. May he cherish hopes?
Queen. (With increasing confusion.) You alarm me, Chevalier.—Surely he will not—
Posa. Here he is.
Enter Carlos . (Posa and Mondecar withdraw to the back ground.) Car. (Falls at the feet of the Queen.) At length the [575]   moment is arrived when Carlos is allowed to touch this hand. Oh happiest moment of my whole existence! Now am I truly blessed.
Queen. Inconsiderate man! What a step have you taken! What a rash and culpable surprise! Rise. We are observed. My attendants are at hand.
Car. I will not rise. Here will I kneel for ever—here will I lie enchanted—rooted to the spot.
Queen. Madman! To what excess has my indulgence led you? Do you know it is your Queen, your mother, whom you with licentious language thus address? Do you know that I—I myself shall acquaint my royal husband with—
Car. Yes, and that I must die. Let me be torn from this spot, and hurried to the place of execution. One moment passed in Paradise is bought too cheap even with loss of life.
Queen. And your Queen?
Car. (Rises.) God of Heaven!—I go—I will leave you. I must —for you require it. Mother! Mother! How great is your influence over me! A look, a sign, a syllable from
[Page 24]
your dear lips wafts me aloft to heaven or down to hell— commands me to exist or perish. What do you wish that I should do? What sacrifice can be required which I will not instantly offer?
Queen. [600]   Fly, then.
Car. Oh God!
Queen. Carlos, all that I request—with tears request, is that you will fly. Do this, I conjure you, ere my attendants, my pages, my jailers , find you and me together in this violent agitation, and bear the dreadful tidings to your father's ears. Still can you stand irresolute? Stay then, and draw down destruction on us both.
Car. I will await my destiny, be it life or death. Have I surmounted every obstacle, waded through all the maze of etiquette, subdued the minotaurs around you, rested my hopes upon this single moment, which allows me to behold you without witnesses, and shall I, after gaining this, become the paltry dupe of false alarm? No, Queen. A thousand times may our globe revolve upon its axis ere Fortune favour me so much again.
Queen. That be assured she never shall. Unfortunate young man, what would you say to me?
Car. Oh Queen, God is my witness I have combated the passion which consumes me with resolution almost more than human—but in vain, in vain! Depressed, annihilated is my courage—I am no longer Carlos.
Queen. No more of this, if my peace of mind be dear to you.
Car. I must—I will speak. My agony is soothed by [625]   this avowal of my feelings. You were mine. You were betrothed to me by two great monarchs in the sight of the world. You were affianced to me by heaven and nature— and Philip, Philip robbed me of you.
Queen. He is your father.
Car. And your husband.

[Page 25]
Queen. From him you will inherit the most extensive monarchy on earth.
Car. And you for a mother.
Queen. Merciful Heavens! You rave.
Car. And does he know how rich he is? Has he a hears, which can feel the value of the treasure he possesses. I would not complain were this the case. No, eternal Providence, I would forgive thee—I would forget how happy— oh how beyond description happy—I could have been with her, had he been so. But he is not—hear it, eternal Providence —he despises thy best gift—he is not happy—he never can be happy. It is this which tortures me. Thou hast robbed me of the sweetest flower that ever bloomed, and hast ordained that it should wither in the icy bosom of King Philip.
Queen. Execrable thought!
Car. Oh, I know full well who was the promoter of this union. I know the love which Philip feels, and what was the foundation of your marriage.—Almighty Nature! Such [650]   a being as thou hast not been able to produce during ten centuries—as thou wilt not be able to produce during ten more—and now, now, now——oh blush for thyself, Nature —bartered for a treaty which will soon be broken—made the shameful purchase of a peace—sent into Spain by the decision of assembled privy-counsellors and prelates—sold like a bale of merchandize, and then delivered to the purchaser! Such are the marriages of kings.
Queen. No more, I do entreat.
Car. What are you in this kingdom?—Tell me.—Have you any power? No. If you had power, would Alba thus spread desolation round him?—would Flanders bleed for maintaining its religion? Or are you Philip's wife? Impossible. A wife is in possession of her husband's heart— but to whom does his belong? The tenderness and the embrace
[Page 26]
which he bestows are borrowed from his sceptre and from age.
Queen. What has induced you to be thus presumptuous? Who told you that the wife of Philip was an object of compassion?
Car. My heart, which feels, and boldly tells you, that, were you the wife of Carlos, you would be an object of envy.
Queen. Vain man! How if my heart asserted the reverse? How if the respectful tenderness of Philip—the silent language of affection in his mien, had more effect upon me than his proud son's presumptuous rhetoric? How if the well-considered [675]   calm regard of an old man—
Car. This alters my ideas—and I beg your pardon. I did not know you loved the king.
Queen. I understand that proud contemptuous smile. No—I do not love him—but to respect him is my pleasure and my wish.
Car. Have you, then, never felt the influence of love?
Queen. This is a strange question.
Car. Have you never felt the influence of love?
Queen. I no longer feel it.
Car. Because your heart, or because the nuptial vow, forbids it?
Queen. Leave me, Prince, and never renew this conversation.
Car. Because your heart, or because the nuptial vow, forbids it?
Queen. Because my duty——Unfortunate young man, why do you thus arraign the will of Fate, which well you know we must obey.
Car. Must!—must obey!
Queen. How! What means this tone?
Car. It means that Carlos bids defiance to a term like must :—that he is not disposed to bend beneath another's will: —that he is not disposed to be the most unhappy in this
[Page 27]
kingdom, when, by opposition to its laws, he can become most happy.
Queen. [700]   Do I understand you? Dare you still cherish hope when all is lost?
Car. I think nothing lost while I have life.
Queen. And place you any hopes upon your mother? (Rivets her eyes on him for some time—then approaches with dignified solemnity.) But why not? The king, as soon as crowned, can do much more than this. He can annul the edicts of his predecessor; declare his memory infamous; destroy what he had built; build what he destroyed; (Carlos is in great agitation) bring forth his ashes from the escurial; expose them to the light of day; scatter them to the four winds of heaven; and, to complete these noble actions—
Car. For heaven's sake proceed no further.
Queen. He can take his mother to his bed.
Car. Cursed be such a son! (After a pause.) It is accomplished. My destiny is fulfilled. I feel, in its utmost force, what should have been concealed from me for ever. To me you are irrevocably lost. Hell lies in the sensation— I cannot bear it. My shattered nerves will soon be rent.
Queen. I pity you, dear Carlos. Completely do I feel the nameless agony which rages in your soul. Boundless is your pain as is your love. Boundless as both is the great merit of subduing them. Be this merit your's, young hero. The prize is worthy of a mighty combatant; worthy of him whose veins contain the blood, whose heart the virtues, of so many noble ancestors. Rouse yourself, Prince. Let the [725]   grandson of Charles renew the fight, when others basely quit the field.
Car. Too late! Oh God! It is too late!
Queen. Too late to be a man! Oh Carlos! How great becomes our virtue when our hearts break in the practice of it! Providence has placed you, Prince, above a million of
[Page 28]
your fellow-creatures. Partial to her Carlos, she took from others what she gave to him, and millions say: “Did he, ere he was born, deserve more than all other mortals?” Rise, Prince. Justify the will of heaven. Deserve to be the first of men, by sacrificing more than any one.
Car. That can I too. To fight for you I have a giant's strength—to lose you I feel myself incapable.
Queen. Confess now, Carlos. It is pride and indignation which make you feel this passion for your mother. The affection, which you lavishly bestow on me, belongs to nations which you will hereafter govern. You are squandering the property of your ward. Remove this affection from me to your future realms, and, instead of the pangs of conscience, feel the delight of being a God. Elizabeth was the first object of your love—be Spain the second. How willingly, good Carlos, will I yield to a rival so superior!
Car. (Falls at her feet, overpowered by his sensations.) How great are your ideas, heavenly woman! Yes. I will do all that you request. I will make any sacrifice. (Rises.) Here I stand, in presence of my Creator, and solemnly swear [750]   I will never again think—(Oh heavens, what do I say?)— I will be silent. I can restrain my tongue, but not my memory.
Queen. How could I ask a vow of Carlos, which I myself should be unwilling to make?
Posa hastily approaches. Posa. The king!
Queen. Heavens!
Posa. Away! Away! Prince!
Queen. His suspicions are dreadful. Should he see you—
Car. He shall. I will remain. Has he, or have I, the greater right to stay here? I am in the humour to ask him this question.

[Page 29]
Queen. And who will be the victim of your rashness?
Car. (Draws Posa away.) Instantly let us begone. (Looks back.) What dare I take with me?
Queen. The esteem of your mother.
Car. Esteem! Mother!
Queen. And these tears from the Netherlands. (Gives him some letters.)
Car. Ha! I comprehend this.                                          [Exeunt Carlos and Posa. (The Queen looks anxiously around for her attendants, whom she cannot see.)
Enter King, Alba, Lerma, Domingo , with Ladies and Grandees. King. (Looks round with surprise, and pauses awhile.) Quite alone, madam! Not even one lady as a companion! This surprises me. Where are your attendants?
Queen. My gracious lord—
King. What means this? You are quite confused, madam. Your face is on fire. All is not as it should be. Why alone? Where are your attendants? (To his suite.) [775]   Let this unpardonable neglect be strictly examined, and the result reported to me. Whose turn was it to wait on you to-day?
Queen. Be not incensed, my lord. I, myself, I am to blame. The princess Eboli went by my desire—
King. By your desire!
Queen. To call the nurse; for I much wished to see my daughter.
King. And therefore you were left without attendants. This is mighty strange, by heaven. In future, madam, let it not be said, to the disgrace of Spain, that Philip's wife when wishing to embrace her child, should thus await it unattended. My kingdom is, I trust, sufficiently populous to provide the Queen with females for her suite. But
[Page 30]
this apology exculpates only the first lady. Where was the second?
Mon. (Who has, in the mean time, returned and joined the other ladies, now approaches.) I confess to your majesty that my conduct is culpable—
King. For which reason I allow you ten years of repentance far from Madrid. (Mondecar weeps, and retires to the back ground. Universal silence prevails. All eyes are anxiously directed to the Queen.)
Queen. If I have erred, my gracious Lord, methinks the diadem of Spain, to which I never did aspire, should, at least, protect me from a situation which obliges me to blush. Is there, in this kingdom, a law by which a monarch's daughter can be compelled to justify herself? Are the wives [800]   of Spaniards to be guarded? Do witnesses defend them better than their virtue? I am not accustomed to let those depart in tears, who have served me with cheerfulness. Mondecar, you have incensed the king, not me. (Unbuckles her splendid girdle, and presents it to Mondecar.) Accept, therefore, this token of my favour.—Leave the kingdom. You have erred only in Spain, and in my native France your tears will soon be wiped away.———Oh. Must I for ever be reminded of the difference between France and Spain. (Leans on one of the attendants, and conceals her face.)
King. (Somewhat agitated.) How, Elizabeth! Is it possible? Heavens! Have I lived to hear this? Could a mere reproach, the offspring of affection, and of anxious tenderness, disturb you thus? (Turns to the Grandees.) Here stand the vassals of my throne. Can any one of you declare that sleep has ever closed my eyes till I have known the pulse of my remotest subjects? And shall I be more anxious for my throne than for the consort of my heart? My sword can protect me against rebellion, but my eye alone can insure to me my wife's affection. Am I not right, Duke Alba? (Alba bows.)

[Page 31]
Queen. If I have offended you, my Lord—
King. I am esteemed the richest man in Christendom. The sun does not set in my dominions. But this my predecessor too possessed, and it will all devolve to my successor, or will not, as Fortune pleases, for to Fortune, in reality, [825]   belongs all that the monarch has, but to Philip, and to him alone, Elizabeth. In this point only am I vulnerable.
Queen. My lord—this suspicion—you alarm me.—Are you afraid—
King. Look at my hoary head. If ever I knew fear, the time is long elapsed.——I am counting the nobles of my court,—the chief of them is wanting. Where is Don Carlos? (No one replies.) This boy begins to excite apprehensions in my mind. Since his return from the college at Alkali, he avoids my presence. His temperament is warm —why is his look so cold? Why is his conduct so peculiarly discreet? Duke Alba, this is a comet which approaches my horizon. I like not such a neighbour. Be vigilant —I repeat it, be vigilant. The heir to so many realms, counts with impatience the pulse of his father. The ambition of being equal to the Almighty, was the origin of devils. Be vigilant, I command you.
Alba. I am and will continue to be so. While my heart shall beat beneath this armour, King Philip may repose in peace. Like the cherubim of God, before the gates of Paradise, Duke Alba stands before the throne.
Ler. May I humbly venture to contradict the wisest of all kings? Too much do I honour and revere your sacred majesty, to judge so harshly of your son. From the ardour of Don Carlos I fear much, but nothing from his [850]   heart.
King. You are a proper man to sooth the father, Count— the Duke shall be the monarch's prop. But more of this to-morrow. (Turns to his suite.) My royal office calls me to Madrid. Thither I instantly repair. The pest of heresy
[Page 32]
has spread among my subjects. Rebellion rages in the Netherlands. It is time that a terrible example should reclaim the wretches. To-morrow I fulfil the mighty oath, sworn by all the kings in Christendom. Terrible shall be my vengeance. The court is hereby solemnly invited to the executions. (Offering his arm to the Queen.) You will accompany me.
Queen. Excuse me. I am a woman—a weak woman—
King. And a christian too, I hope. Come with me to prove it. (Leads her away—the rest follow.)
Enter Carlos with letters, and Posa . Car. Enough! I am resolved. Flanders shall be rescued. It is her will, and therefore my law.
Posa. Nor must a moment be lost. Duke Alba, I am told, is already appointed governor.
Car. Appointed!—Well—but he is not gone. To-morrow, therefore, I will apply for an audience of my father. It is my first request, and he cannot refuse it. My presence in Madrid has long been disagreeable to him. What a happy opportunity to remove me from the capital! And—shall I confess it, Roderigo—I cherish hopes that, by this personal [875]   interview, I may regain his favour. He has never listened to the voice of nature. I will try what power it will have, when it issues from my lips.
Posa. Now do I recognize my Carlos. Now you are again yourself.
Car. I feel celestial transport in each vein.—Such an effect has the sight of the dear queen produced!
Enter Lerma . Ler. His Majesty has just left Aranjuez, and commanded me—
Car. 'Tis well, Count Lerma. I shall follow.

[Page 33]
Posa. (Bows with a degree of ceremony, as if going.) Has your Royal Highness no further commands?
Car. None, whatever, Chevalier. I congratulate you on your arrival at Madrid. I will hear more respecting Flanders at another time. (To Lerma, who still waits.) I shall follow immediately.                                          [Exit. Lerma. I understood you, and I thank you; but this ceremony can only be excused by the presence of a third. Are we not brothers? Let the parade of rank be henceforth banished from our intercourse. Fancy that we met each other at a masquerade; you in the habit of a slave, and I, for the whim's sake, clad in purple. While the company observed us, we should support our several characters with ridiculous solemnity, that their entertainment might not be destroyed; but Carlos, through his mask, might wink to you, and you, in passing, might shake hands with him.
Posa. [900]   This vision is delightful, but will it be of long duration? Does my Carlos feel positive that he can resist the charms of uncontrolled dominion? The day will come, when he will find the trial most severe.—King Philip dies. Carlos inherits the largest monarchy in Christendom. At once a boundless gulph divides him from the rest of men. He, who was yesterday but human, is to-day divine. He has now no weaknesses. Fate sits upon his brow. Crowds hasten to do homage to their idol, and to barter their honour for his favour. His sympathy is ended with his sufferings. His virtue falls a victim to voluptuousness. To support his folly, gold is sent from Peru. To encourage his vices, demons lurk at his court. Intoxicated with the pleasures provided by his slaves, he sinks to rest. His divinity exists as long as his dream, and woe be to the wretch who dares to wake him!—What would now be Roderigo's case? Friendship is bold and open. Enfeebled Majesty would not be
[Page 34]
able to endure its beams! You would not endure the subject's pride, nor I the monarch's haughtiness.
Car. Faithful and horrid is your picture of a king. But this excess of pleasure you have mentioned will not corrupt your Carlos. At three and twenty years of age, I can declare that I am pure. That better half of us, the vigour of the mind, which many thoughtless thousands have squandered in voluptuous embraces, I have reserved as a support [925]   upon the throne. Even before I knew Elizabeth, I had successfully opposed the strong allurements which surrounded me. Surely, then, I need not fear them now. Tell me— could any but a woman expel you from my heart?
Posa. Yes. I myself; for could I be as much your friend, when I must fear you?
Car. That can never be. Will you want my assistance? No.—Will your passions allow you to crouch at the steps of the throne? No.—Will you wish for money? No, for you will be a richer subject than I shall be a king.—Will you covet honours?—No, for you have had abundance in your youth—nay, have refused them:—which of us will be the creditor, and which the debtor?—You are silent.—You tremble at the idea of making the attempt. Can you not, then, rely upon yourself?
Posa. Enough! I yield.—There is my hand.
Car. You will be my friend?
Posa. For ever—and in the most unlimited sense of the term.
Car. As warmly, and as faithfully devoted to the King, as you have ever been to the Infant?
Posa. That I swear.
Car. If the serpent Flattery should twine around my heart—if this eye should forget that it could weep—if this ear should be deaf to the petitions of the wretched—will you, [950]   Roderigo, will you be the undaunted guardian of my virtue? —will you rouse me, and compel me to be what I was?

[Page 35]
Posa. I will.
Car. Then are we friends for ever. Now to the king.— I have no longer any fears. Arm in arm with you, I bid defiance to temptation and to danger—
                                         [Exeunt.

END OF ACT I.

[Page 36]
ACT II. Scene Scene , the Royal Palace at Madrid. The King is seated on a throne beneath a canopy, and Alba is standing at a distance. Lerma opens the door, and ushers in Carlos, who kneels to the King, then rises, and retires a few steps. For some moments universal silence prevails. Carlos looks with mingled surprise and sensibility at the Duke, and then at the King. Car. I wait in expectation of being told at what more proper hour your Majesty will hear my petition.
King. Has the Infant's petition any reference to my hours —or to me only? I shall decide upon it now. You have leave to speak.—
Car. The kingdom is entitled to a preference, and I willingly give way to the minister. He speaks in behalf of the kingdom. (Bows and retires.)
King. The Duke will stay. The Infant will proceed.
Car. (To Alba.) I must then, Duke Alba, request a favour of you. This is a private audience of the King. A son, you know, may say many things to his father, which it is hardly proper that a third should hear. I will not long detain his Majesty. (Alba looks toward the King for his orders.)
King. This is my friend.
Car. (After a short pause.) Has my merit been such, that I may be certain he is also mine?
King. Or will your merit ever be such? I do not like the son who thinks his choice of friends superior to his father's.
Car. Can Duke Alba's spirit allow him to remain during this scene? By heaven! I would not earn a diadem by being
[Page 37]
that mean creature, who shackles the discourse of a father and his son; who blushes not to interfere with the sacred mysteries of nature.
King. (Leaves his seat, darting a look of fury at the Prince.) [25]   Retire, Duke Alba. (Alba walks toward the door at which Carlos entered.) No. Into my cabinet, till you are called.—
                                         [Exit Alba into the cabinet. Car. (Approaches the King, falls at his feet, and addresses him in a tone of heartfelt sensibility.) Now you are again my father. Accept my warmest thanks for this favour. —Your hand, my father. Oh day of bliss! Long is it since I was allowed to kiss this hand. And why not— good heavens, why not? Oh, how the recollection racks my soul! Why have I been so long an alien to your heart? What have I done? Curse on suspicion, that destructive viper, which poisons and corrupts even sacred instinct. Is it possible that, for three and twenty years, the world has called me Philip's son, and that he alone has never known it.
King. Infant, your heart is not accustomed to deceptions of this kind. No more! I like them not.
Car. (Rises.) Ha! There spoke your courtiers.—Father, all is not good which a priest says, which a priest's creatures say. No, by heaven.—Believe me, father, I am not depraved. Warmth of temper is my vice, and youth my crime. Oh believe me, I am not depraved; and though impetuous passions storm my heart, yet still that heart is good.
King. I know your heart is pure, as is your prayer.
Car. May I never know the mercy of my Redeemer, if [50]   I be a hypocrite! This is an awful hour for me—yes, awful and decisive. We are alone—unfettered by the chains of rank—freed from that barrier etiquette, which separates the father from his son. A beam of hope darts through my
[Page 38]
soul—sweet expectation animates my heart. The holy host of heaven looks down and smiles upon us.—My father! Be reconciled to me. (Falls at his feet.)
Phi. Rise, and leave me.
Car. Be reconciled to me, my father.
Phi. (Tearing himself from his son's embrace.) What means this bold hypocrisy?
Car. Is a son too bold, when he but avows his dutiful affection?
King. In tears, too!—Pshaw!—Out of my sight!
Car. The decisive moment is arrived. Be reconciled to me.
King. Begone, I say. I would as soon embrace thee, hadst thou come from my defeated army, loaded with the charge of cowardice. Thus I spurn thee. (Pushes him away.) Base guilt alone would thus attempt to wash away its stain. He who does not blush at being penitent, will fearlessly commit the crimes which ought to be repented.
Car. (Gazes long at the King with fearful astonishment.) Who is this? By what mistake has this unnatural man been sent into our world?—Tears have ever been the credentials of humanity. He never shed them. He was not born of [75]   woman. The sweet delight which inward satisfaction grants, even while we suffer, which even makes sorrow enviable, which unites mortality to immortality, which might induce even angels to accept our nature—this sweet delight, which tears afford, he never knew. Oh compel those eyes, which never yet were moistened, to shed tears, else, in some heavy hour, thy prayers for them will be in vain.
King. Dost thou imagine that thy specious words will shake my strong suspicions?
Car. Suspicions! I will remove—annihilate them. I will hang upon my father's heart till it has shaken them off. Who has robbed me of a parent's love! What requital has the monk given my father for the loss of Carlos? How will
[Page 39]
Alba repay him for his resolution to be childless?—You want affection?—Here, in this bosom, springs a fountain of it, more pure, more uncorrupted than the muddy sources, which must be opened by the gold of Philip.
King. Rash boy, no more. The men whom thou dost slander are my well-tried servants, and the supporters of my throne. Yes, proud boy—and thou shalt learn to honour them.
Car. Never! I feel my powers. All the services which Alba can render, Carlos can exceed. What cares a hireling for the throne, which never will be his? What cares he if Philip's head grows grey? If Philip dies, why still his King [100]   remains, for Philip's coinage still is current.—Your Carlos would have loved you.——Oh what a dreadful thought it is to feel, when on a throne, “I am a solitary being.”
King. (Starts, is lost in meditation for some time, then exclaims, with a sigh,) I am a solitary being.
Car. (Approaches him with ardour.) You have been so. Hate me no longer. And no longer will you feel this horrible sensation. Oh, how delightful is it to know that other souls feel what we feel; that our delights delight another's heart; that our distresses cause another's sympathy,—another's tears! How sweet is it with an affectionate and much loved son to trace the early years of life, and dream again what was so like a dream! How sweet to be immortal, through the virtues of that son! How great through him to appear again, as the moon shews the glorious orb from which it gained its lustre! How gratifying must it be to sow what a dear son will reap; to hoard a treasure, which he will enjoy; to anticipate the gratitude which he will feel.——Oh my father, this earthly paradise is, by your monks, for reasons which their policy directs, concealed from you.
King. (Somewhat affected.) My son, my son, you break the staff by which you would support yourself. You paint in
[Page 40]
glowing colours that happiness which you never have bestowed on me.
Car. Be the Almighty my judge!—You, you yourself excluded me from your parental love, and from all interference [125]   with the state. Till now—yes, till this very day—(Oh, was it just?) the hereditary Prince of Spain has been in Spain a stranger; a prisoner in the land which he is born to govern. How often have I blushed, and cast my eyes upon the earth, when the ambassadors of foreign powers, and newspapers, have first informed me what was passing at my father's court! Then, with a heavy heart, I oft have sportfully replied: “The King conceals his secrets from me, that, on the day of coronation, I may be more surprised.”
King. (Earnestly fixing his eye on Carlos.) Carlos, you make frequent references to the time when I shall be no more.
Car. No, by Heaven. I refer but to the time when I shall be a man. Whose is the fault, if these be both the same?
King. You hold an honourable office at my court,—you are, it seems, the minute-hand of my mortality. In return for having given you life, you gratefully remind me I must die.
Car. (With ardour.) Employ me, and if my prayers could then avail, you should possess your crown for ever.
King. You must be patient. As yet your veins are swollen with the boiling blood of youth.
Car. That I own—my veins are swollen, for I am Philip's son—I am three and twenty years of age, and hitherto have been inactive. I have awoke, and now I feel my powers. My claim to the throne calls on me as a creditor, and all the [150]   hours which I have lost are debts of honour. The glorious moment is arrived when I can pay these debts with interest. My ancestors and fame demand I should exert myself. The lists of high renown are opened.—My liege, may I declare what brought me hither? The petition, which—
King. Another petition! Proceed.

[Page 41]
Car. The rebellion in Brabant becomes more serious. The obstinacy of the insurgents demands a strong and politic resistance. To tame the fury of the enthusiasts, Duke Alba, I am told, is going to Flanders, vested with sovereign power. How honourable is this office—how exactly suited to bring forward Philip's son and Charles's grandson, to the notice of the present age, and of posterity! To me, my liege, my father, to me entrust this great command. The inhabitants of Flanders love me, and I dare boldly answer for their firm fidelity.
King. You talk like one asleep. This situation must be filled by an experienced man—not by a boy.
Car. By a man, my father—that Alba never was.
King. Compassion, in a case like this, were madness. Your heart is weak, and soon affected. Terror alone can overpower rebellion. The duke is feared in Flanders. Desist from your request.
Car. Send me, my father, send me with the army, I beseech you. Make this first trial of the heart which you accuse [175]   of weakness. The name of Philip's son, while it precedes my banner, will gain over to him those whom Alba's executioners would murder. On my knees I beg, (and for the first time in my life) that you will give me the command in Flanders.
King. (After a long pause, during which he surveys the Infant with a penetrating look.) Over my choicest army? Entrust a dagger to my murderer!
Car. (Starts.) Gracious Heaven! Is this the fruit of an interview, which I so long have wished for? (After a pause, in a more humble tone.) Answer me more mildly.— Dismiss me not with such a harsh suspicion. Let me not go with such a heavy heart. Oh, answer me more mildly. Do something which will whet my filial duty, which will for ever make me your debtor. Treat me more graciously. It is the
[Page 42]
last petition of your almost despairing son. Your affection can alone preserve my virtue.
King. (Suddenly turns to him, with a menacing look.) Your virtue!
Car. (Alarmed.) Heavens! What have I said? I am almost frantic. I cannot bear with fortitude your constant opposition to my wishes. Now, let me depart. Unheard, deceived in all his sweet presages, Carlos goes, that Alba and Domingo may triumphantly enjoy their influence over his father. The assembled courtiers and grandees, as well as yonder squalid herd of monks, were witnesses that Philip [200]   granted me an audience. Do not confuse me thus. Do not so deeply wound my feelings as to shew this fawning crew that strangers revel on your bounty; but that your only son cannot obtain what he requests. As a proof that I am in your favour, send me to Flanders with the army.
King. Repeat not this, as thou dost fear thy monarch's anger.
Car. I will meet my monarch's anger. For the last time, send me to Flanders. I must leave Spain. A disorder rages in my frame, which no one is aware of. While I stay here I feel as if the arm of the executioner were raised against me. The air of Madrid oppresses me like the consciousness of murder. A change of climate can alone restore me. If you wish me to recover—send me, without delay, to Flanders.
King. (With assumed composure.) Such invalids as you, my son, require much care, and should be kept under the eye of the physician. You, therefore, shall remain at home —the duke shall go to Flanders.
Car. (Almost frantic.) Spirits of light, surround me—
King. (Retreats a step.) How! What mean these gestures?
Car. (With tremulous utterance.) Is your decree irrevocable?
King. It was the King's decree.

[Page 43]
Car. Then is my business ended. (Bows, and is going.)
King. (Looks at him with wonder.) Infant, this silent departure is not respectful.
Car. [225]   No.
King. No!
Car. For I just thought I saw the will of the late Emperor, your father, smoking on a pile.
King. (Alarmed.) Ha! What means this?
Car. He was a great man, and a perfect monarch. He gave—I shall receive. Wide will be the difference between such a son and such a father.
                                         [Exit. King. (Hides his face and strikes his breast.) O God, too heavily thy hand lies on me.—My son! My son! (Stands for some time in gloomy meditation, then walks to and fro with rapid strides. Alba approaches, somewhat embarrassed.) Be ready to depart for Brussels at an hour's notice.
Alba. Every preparation is made according to your Majesty's orders.
King. Your full powers are already signed and sealed. Now go—take leave of the Queen, and of the Infant.
Alba. I saw his Highness hasten hence with frantic gestures. Your Majesty seems also violently agitated. Perhaps the subject of your conversation—
Phi. The subject was Duke Alba. (Rivets his eye on him.) Be not alarmed. I shall never alter my opinion of you. (The Duke becomes thoughtful, and the King continues to observe him attentively.) The Prince is not your friend.
Alba. I am proud of sharing my Monarch's fate.
King. (With a gloomy mein.) I knew not that Duke Alba shared any thing with me. I could hear, with pleasure, [250]   that Don Carlos hates my ministers, but am sorry to perceive that he despises them. (Alba's colour mounts into his cheeks, and he is about to speak.) No answer, now. You have my permission to appease the Prince.
Alba. My liege, I am a soldier and a knight.

[Page 44]
King. The Infant is your Monarch's son. I leave you to decide how far you are justified in demanding his concession. Tell me—who first apprized me of my son's designs? At that time I listened to you, and not to him. I will try an experiment. In future, Don Carlos shall be nearer to my throne. Now go.
                                         [Exeunt severally. Scene Scene , the Queen's Antichamber. Enter Carlos and a Page . The Attendants , who were discovered in the Room, withdraw, at his approach, into the adjoining Apartments. Car. A letter to me!—A key sent with it too!—And both delivered so privately!—Come nearer. Who entrusted these to your care?
Page. (With an air of mystery.) As far as I can judge, the lady rather wishes that you should guess than I mention her name.
Car. (Starts.) The lady! (Observes the Page more attentively.) How!——Who are you?
Page. One of her Majesty's pages.
Car. (Rushes towards him, and places his hand on his mouth.) Peace, or I'll murder thee. I know enough.— (Hastily opens the letter, and withdraws to the end of the room. While he is reading it, Alba enters, and passes to the Queen's apartments, without being observed by the Prince. Carlos trembles—his face alternately glows, and is pale. He fixes his eye for a long time on the letter, and at length turns to the Page.) She herself gave you this?
Page. With her own hands.
Car. She herself!—Oh do not mock me. Never have I yet beheld her writing, but if you swear, I must believe you. [275]   If what you said be false, confess,—but do not mock me.
Page. Mock Don Carlos!
Car. (Looks again at the letter, and then at the Page, with a penetrating eye.) Your parents are, I think, alive Is not your father in the army?

[Page 45]
Page. Alas, no. He fell at the battle of St. Quentin, while fighting, as a colonel of cavalry, under the Duke of Savoy.
Car. (Takes his hand, and gazes significantly at him.) The King sent you with this letter.
Page. Gracious Prince, how have I deserved this suspicion?
Car. In tears! Oh, then forgive me. (Reads the letter.) “This key opens the door of a room in the back part of the Queen's apartments, adjoining to which is a cabinet secure from prying curiosity. Here may that love be frankly owned, which hitherto has been confined to hints. The timid youth may here avow his flame, and reap the harvest of his hopes and patience. E.”—I am awake—and in possession of my senses. This is my right arm—this is my sword—and these are written words.—True, true! It is reality. I am beloved. I am the happiest of all happy men. I am beloved. —Oh, Almighty God, why am I not the lord of thy creation, that I might grant a portion of my ecstasy to every being?
Page. Follow me, then, Prince.
Car. First, let me compose myself. My every limb trembles with sweet alarm. Never have I been so bold as [300]   even to dream this! Where is the man who can so suddenly alter his nature, and at once become a God. Who was I, and who am I now?—This is another climate. This is not the world where tears should flow. No. That was but a dream of my distempered fancy. It is past, and I am now awake. She loves me. O let me proclaim to all Madrid, the court, the kingdom, my unbounded bliss. (Going.)
Page. Whither is your Highness going? You forget.
Car. (Assailed by sudden recollection.) The King, my father. (Endeavours to compose himself.) Horrible!—Yes, you are right, my friend. I thank you. I was not myself. That I must be silent, that I must bury in my bosom this
[Page 46]
excess of joy, is horrible. Subterraneous gold, I've heard, must be dug for, during a death-like silence; therefore I will not even breathe. (Takes the Page's hand, and leads him aside.) Be all that you have seen to-day, or even suspected, buried in your bosom. Now go. I shall find the way. Go. We must not be seen together. (Page is about to obey.) Yet hold! (He returns. Carlos lays his hand upon the Page's shoulder, and gazes earnestly at him.) You take away with you a dreadful secret. Like poison it may break the vessel which contains it.—Let it not approach too near the throne. Keep your words and gestures under strict control. Let not your reason attempt to dive into the secret which your bosom harbours. Resemble the trumpet which [325]   receives a sound, and forwards it, yet hears it not. You are still a boy—continue to appear so, and be happy. How politic she was to fix on such a messenger. Among the pages Philip will not look for vipers.
Page. And I, Don Carlos, shall feel pleasure in the idea that I know one secret which the King does not.
Car. Vain boy! That is the exact sensation, which you must avoid. If we should meet in public, approach me with formality and distance. Never let vanity induce you even to hint how gracious I am towards you. You cannot, in the eyes of courtiers, be guilty of a greater crime than pleasing me.—The messages to me, with which you may hereafter be entrusted, do not even utter. Confide not in your lips. Let not your thoughts be ready to escape when you espy me, but rather let them follow me through pathless deserts, where no one can discover them. When opportunity occurs, speak to me with your fingers—I will listen with my eyes. The light we see, the very air we breathe, are Philip's creatures. Even the deaf walls are in his pay.——I hear footsteps. (Enter Alba from the Queen's apartments.) Away!—Instantly away!
Page. Do not mistake the apartment, Prince.

[Page 47]
Car. It is the Duke.—No, No. I shall not.
                                         [Exit Page. Alba. (To Carlos, who is going.) May I be allowed a moment's conversation with the Infant?
Car. [350]   Another time, Duke Alba.
Alba. This is not, I must own, a proper place. Perhaps it may please your Highness to grant me an audience in your own apartments.
Car. For what purpose? It may as well be done here— but be brief.
Alba. I come, in fact, most humbly to return my thanks.
Car. Thanks! For what? Thanks from Duke Alba!
Alba. Yes—for scarcely had your Highness left the King, ere I was ordered to depart for Brussels.
Car. Indeed!
Alba. To whom, therefore, can I be obliged for the dignity conferred upon me, but to your Highness?
Car. No, on my soul. To me you are not in the least obliged for it. Go, and heaven be with you!
Alba. Is this all? Your Highness much surprises me. Have you no other commands to Flanders?
Car. How should I?
Alba. Yet but a short time since it seemed as if that country required the actual presence of Don Carlos.
Car. How!—But true—I am glad it is not so.
Alba. You surprise me—
Car. (Not ironically.) You are a great general—every one knows it—envy must allow it. I am a young man. Such also was the King's opinion—and the King is right. I am [375]   convinced of my error. I am glad that you are going— therefore enough of this. The rest may be discussed tomorrow, or when you return from Brussels.
Alba. How! In ten years!
Car. Till then farewell. (After a pause, perceiving that the Duke remains, he proceeds.) The season of the year is favourable. Your road is through Milan, Lorrain, Burgundy,
[Page 48]
and Germany.—Germany!—Ay, there it was. The Germans know you well. This is April—May—June— July—yes, in July, or, at the latest, early in August, you will be at Brussels. Doubtless we soon shall hear of your exploits. You will, of course, make yourself worthy of our gracious confidence.
Alba. (Significantly.) Is that possible?
Car. I understand you, duke, and much lament I have not time for a discussion of the subject you allude to.
Alba. Prince, we do not understand each other.
Car. Explain, then, what you mean.
Alba. I mean to state the value of this arm. Your father knows that it is easier to beget a monarch than to gain a monarchy—that it is easier to provide beings for the world, than a world for those beings.
Car. And what am I to infer from this?
Alba. That princes often ridicule their nurses, and sleep, with thoughtless ease, upon the cushion of a warrior's victories. [400]   In the diadem the jewels, and the jewels only, sparkle, —not the wounds by which that diadem was gained.—This sword prescribed the laws of Spain to foreign nations. It was exerted in religion's cause, and ploughed up bloody furrows for the seeds of faith. God judged in heaven, and I on earth.
Car. Whether it was God or the devil, was immaterial. You were his right arm. I know all this—and, at present, no more of it, I beg; for I wish to avoid a painful recollection. I revere my father's choice. He feels the want of Alba, but I do not envy this sensation. You are a great man— that I allow—but I fear you were born some centuries before the proper period. Methinks an Alba should have appeared when the dissolution of all animated nature was at hand. —At such a time, when the gigantic power of guilt shall even dare to defy the Almighty, when the abundant harvest of iniquity shall demand an unexampled reaper—then would
[Page 49]
you have been in your proper place.———Oh heavens! My Paradise! My Flanders! But I must not think of it. Let us quit the subject.
Alba. To sacrifice mankind when for the good of human nature is compassion. Heaven itself once gave us this example. To purify the world, the world itself perished.— Pestilence—
Car. Yes, Pestilence is your symbol. It marks the life [425]   of Alba, and the government of Philip. I have heard that you take with you sentences of death, already signed. The provision is, I own, most praiseworthy.—Oh my father, how have I mistaken you! I accused you of severity, when you but refused me the situation in which Alba can shine. This was the first mark of your regard.
Alba. Prince, that expression merits—
Car. (Incensed.) What?
Alba. But your royal blood protects you.
Car. (Draws.) This calls for satisfaction. Draw.
Alba. (Coldly.) Against whom?
Car. (Rushing towards him.) Draw, or by heaven this moment is thy last.
Alba. (Draws.) Since it must be so. (They fight.)
Enter Queen . Queen. (Alarmed.) Swords! (To the Prince, in a commanding tone.) Carlos!
Car. (Drops his sword on seeing the Queen, remains motionless awhile, then hastens towards Alba, and presents his hand.) Be reconciled, Duke. Be all forgotten. (Falls at the Queen's feet; then rises, and instantly rushes out of the apartment.)
Alba. (Who has been an attentive spectator of what passed.) By heaven—but this is strange.
Queen. (Is uneasy, and, for a few moments, undecided how to act—she then slowly approaches her apartment, and turns
[Page 50]
at the door.) Duke Alba. (He follows her into the apartment.)
Scene Scene , the Princess Eboli's Cabinet. She is discovered on a sofa with her lute. Her dress is simple, yet beautiful. Ebo. (Plays and sings—in a few moments she hastily rises.) Ha! He comes.
Enter Page . Page. Are you alone?
Ebo. He comes. I hear it in your very foot-steps; I hear it in your very breath. Instantly declare he comes.
Page. I am much surprised that he is not already here; but you may expect him every moment.
Ebo. [450]   You are sure of this?
Page. He must be close behind me. Oh Princess, you are loved as no one ever yet was loved. What a scene did I witness!
Ebo. (Draws him towards her.) What saw you? What said he? How did he look? Was he surprised—confused? Did he suspect that I had sent the key?—Quick!—Tell me. —Or did he suspect some other person?—Well! Why do you not reply? Speak, you never were before half so inanimate.
Page. Gracious Princess, you command, yet will not allow me to speak. I delivered the note and key to him, in the Queen's antichamber. He started when I told him that a lady sent them.
Ebo. Started! Excellent! Proceed.
Page. I wanted to say more, but he turned pale, snatched the letter from my hand, and told me he knew all. He read the letter—seemed astonished—and began to tremble.

[Page 51]
Ebo. Knew all! Said he that?
Page. He did, and several times he asked me whether you yourself had actually entrusted the letter to my care?
Ebo. I myself! He mentioned my name, then?
Page. No—I don't remember that he did. He said there were spies not far off, who might repeat it to the King.
Ebo. (Embarrassed.) [475]   Said he that?
Page. He said it was of the utmost consequence that his majesty should have no information respecting the letter.
Ebo. His majesty! Are you sure of this?
Page. Yes. He called it a dangerous secret, and warned me against any signs or words which might excite suspicion in the King.
Ebo. (Much surprised.) Every thing corresponds—it must be so—he knows the whole affair—yet how can he have learnt it? How? Need I ask? What is so keen as the eagle-eye of love? But proceed. He read the note—
Page. Yes, and he said the tidings were so joyful that they made him tremble, and was proceeding to speak of the key when Duke Alba entered, which compelled us—
Ebo. Tormenting! What had the duke to do there? But the key—what said he of the key? Be not so brief— I never knew you thus before. What said he?
Page. That it was the key of Paradise.
Ebo. But why does he not come? Where is he? Surely he might have enjoyed the moments, which you have occupied, in telling me how happy he will be.
Page. The duke, I fear—
Ebo. The duke again! What does he want? Why does a warrior interfere with my peaceful happiness? The Prince might have left him, or dismissed him. Alas! Carlos, [500]   it seems, but little knows our sex, as little as he knows the force of love, else would the minutes—

[Page 52]
Page. Princess, you rail against an angel.
Ebo. (Blushing.) Young deceiver! Who told you that?
Page. (With enthusiasm.) So great, so noble, yet so good. What a pity is it he must be my King. I wish he were my brother.
Ebo. (Turns away, wipes her eyes, and presses the Page's hand.) And you have never yet reminded me, how much I am a debtor for your services. (Takes a sword-belt, covered with jewels, from the table, and presents it to the Page.) Let this token remind you of me, good youth, when first you wear a sword.
Page. (Retreating, with downcast eyes.) Does the happy Princess thus reward me? Has the intelligence I brought merited nothing better? Shall I, at such a moment, be content with diamonds? Shall I, who have seen those cheeks animated with the blush of love, and know who is destined to revel in those charms, be satisfied with such a recompence as this?
Ebo. Some one approaches. Away! It is the Prince.                                          [Exit Page. Where is my lute?—He shall surprise me. Music shall lead him hither. (Throws herself on the sofa, and plays.)
Carlos rushes in. Car. (Espies Eboli, and stands rooted to the spot.) God of heaven! Where am I?
Ebo. (Lets the lute fall, and rises.) Don Carlos! Yes, it is you.
Car. (In violent agitation.) [525]   Where am I? Accursed error! I have mistaken the apartment.
Ebo. (With affected surprise.) How well Don Carlos knows to find the rooms where ladies are alone.
Car. (Stammering.) Princess—pardon me, Princess—the door was open.
Ebo. (Jocosely.) Can that be possible! I thought that I myself had locked it.

[Page 53]
Car. That you might fancy—but be assured you were mistaken. You might intend to lock it, and to bolt it— but it was not locked. The outward bolt—that is —I mean the inward bolt——yes, that was fastened, I allow.
Ebo. And yet you entered?—Well! you are mighty clever, truly. Instruct me thus to counteract the power of locks and bolts.
Car. Nothing is more natural—nothing more easy—for, fortunately—I would say unfortunately—I happened to possess a key, which exactly suited the lock. An accident led me hither——I heard some one play upon a lute——was it not a lute? (Looks doubtfully around.) Yes—there it lies —and the music of a lute, heaven knows, I love beyond description. I listened with attention, till I forgot myself, and rushed into this room, that I might see the charming minstrel, who had overpowered me.
Ebo. (After having, in vain, attempted to fix his wandering eye.) [550]   A most amiable curiosity, which you have, however, soon conquered, as I could prove. (After a pause, in a significant tone.) I admire the man, who involves himself in falshoods, that he may spare a female's blushes.
Car. Princess, I feel that I make matters worse, by trying to improve them. Release me from a part which I am not fit to act. In this apartment you sought retirement from the world. Here, undisturbed by man, you wished to reflect upon the secrets of your heart. I, at a luckless moment, have appeared, and interrupted your sweet meditations. My instant departure shall, in some degree, atone—
                                         [Going. Ebo. (Is astonished and alarmed, but immediately recollects herself.) Prince!——Is this proper?
Car. I understand the meaning of that look in this apartment, and I revere your virtuous embarrassment. Cursed be
[Page 54]
the man who grows more bold because a woman blushes. I am a coward when I see a female tremble.
Ebo. Is it possible? Such consciences are rare among young men and Princes. Now, Don Carlos, you must stay —even I myself request it; for so much virtue would remove all scruples even in the most timid of our sex. Not one in a thousand would have acted thus, when tempted by a key which so readily obeyed him. But why should we waste in idle words the happy moments, which accident has granted us? Do you know that your appearance interrupted me in my favourite air? (Leads him to the sofa, and takes her lute.) [575]   I must play it again, Don Carlos, and your punishment shall be to listen.
Car. (Seats himself at her side, not quite without constraint.) A punishment as desirable as my error—and, in truth, the words, as well as the music, were so charming, that I could hear them a third time with delight.
Ebo. How! Did you hear them, then? That was shameful, Prince.—I believe love was the subject.
Car. Yes, you sung of happy love—the sweetest subject from the sweetest lips—although not quite so true as sweet.
Ebo. Not true? Have you doubts?
Car. When love is the subject, I much doubt whether Don Carlos and the Princess Eboli will ever comprehend each other. (Eboli starts—he observes it, and proceeds, with an easy air of gallantry.) For who, when he heholds those rosy cheeks, will think that any passion ever raged within your bosom? Can Eboli sigh unregarded? No—and he alone can feel the power of love, whose love is hopeless.
Ebo. (Who has regained her former cheerfulness.) Oh, peace! Why this sounds terrible indeed. It seems to be your destiny to feel what you describe. (Taking his hand with a captivating smile.) You are not in good spirits, Prince. How happens this? How can you, surrounded by the pleasures of the world, and so highly gifted by the
[Page 55]
prodigal hand of nature, be thus depressed—you, who are a potent monarch's son—you, whose talents even eclipse your [600]   rank—you, whose worth and glory have gained the universal suffrage of those rigid judges, women—you, who conquer with a look, and have in your gift the joys of Paradise—— can you be wretched?——Oh, heaven, why, when thou didst shower thy choicest gifts upon him, why didst thou make him blind to his own conquests?
Car. (Who has, throughout this speech, been lost in meditation, rouses himself as soon as Eboli ceases.) Excellent! inimitable, Princess! Pray sing that stanza again.
Ebo. (Astonished.) Carlos! Of what were you thinking?
Car. (Springs up.) True. It was well you reminded me. I must leave you instantly.
Ebo. (Detains him.) Whither are you going!
Car. (In violent agitation.) You know whither—but no, no, no—you do not know.—I must go—I must hasten into the open air.—Release me—Princess, I feel as if the world were in flames.
Ebo. (Holds him back by force.) What means this? Whence this strange, unnatural conduct? (Carlos again becomes thoughtful—she avails herself of this opportunity to seat him on the sofa.) Compose yourself, dear Carlos. You are much agitated. Sit here—here, at my side.—Do you even know what thus disturbs you?—Nay, granting that you do, is there no knight, no lady at this court, who could remove—I mean, could comprehend your illness?
Car. (With thoughtless indifference.) Perhaps the Princess Eboli.
Ebo. (Joyfully.) [625]   Indeed!
Car. Give me a letter of recommendation to my father. You have great interest with him, I am told.
Ebo. Who told you so? (Aside.) Ha! It was this suspicion, then, which made him dumb.

[Page 56]
Car. The story is, perhaps, already public. I have formed a sudden wish to visit Flanders—merely to earn the spurs of knighthood; but my considerate father thinks that if I command an army, it will spoil my singing.
Ebo. Carlos, you deceive me. Confess, now, that this is a mere subterfuge. Look at me, hypocrite. He who thinks of nothing but the exploits of chivalry, would hardly demean himself so far as to steal the ribbands which a lady loses, and—pardon me, (Nimbly draws from his bosom a ribband, which was there concealed.) To hide them in his breast.
Car. (Extremely embarrassed.) Princess—this is too much—I am betrayed.—You are combined with demons to undo me.
Ebo. Are you surprised at that? What will you bet, Prince, that I do not remind you of transactions which are long since faded in your memory? If even every little motion, every half-articulated sound, every transient smile— if even your features, when your mind was not expressed in them, have not escaped my observation, judge whether I could fail to understand what you intended that I should.
Car. [650]   You have a good opinion of your powers.—I will make this wager. You promise to discover some sensations in my heart, of which I was myself unconscious.
Ebo. How, Prince! Look round. This cabinet is not one of the Queen's apartments, where, at a ball, Don Carlos has been known to praise a mask.—You start—the colour mounts into your cheeks.—Undoubtedly it is a daring and unpardonable act to observe the actions of Don Carlos! but it was remarked, at the late ball, that he forsook the Queen, his partner, and hurried to another couple, in order to take the hand of Eboli—a mistake which even caught the attention of His Majesty, who had just arrived.
Car. (With an ironical smile.) It was rather unfortunate, I own, that he of all men should perceive.

[Page 57]
Ebo. I could remind you, too, that once, when playing with the Queen and me at cards, you dexterously contrived to steal this glove, (Carlos springs up in great agitation.) and were gallant enough to play it on the table, as if it were a card.
Car. God of heaven! What have I done?
Ebo. Nothing which you will recal, I hope. How agreeably was I surprised when I found the note, which you had contrived to hide in the glove. The lines were written in a style so moving—
Car. (Interrupting her.) A mere copy of verses. My [675]   brain delights in forming bubbles, which burst as soon as they are made. Let us drop this subject.
Ebo. (Walks away, and, with looks of astonishment, surveys him from a distance.) This is too much.—All my attempts are fruitless.— (A pause.) But how if this were pride, which but assumes the mask of diffidence, that it may the more enjoy its conquest? (Approaches Carlos with a doubtful look.) Assist me, Prince. I have now before me an enchanted chest, to which I cannot find a key.
Car. I am in the same situation.
Ebo. (Instantly leaves him, walks up and down the room, then turns to Carlos, with a solemn mien.) Be it so. At last I am obliged to speak. I make you my confidant. You are a worthy man, a knight, a prince. I place myself under your protection. You will rescue me—or if you cannot rescue—you will sympathise in my sad fate. (Carlos approaches with a look of an anxious expectation.) An audacious favourite of the king has demanded my hand—Rui Gomez, Count of Silva. Your father has consented, and I am sold, like merchandize, to this vile creature.
Car. (Assailed by a dreadful recollection.) Sold! What! Sold again! No more of this, I beg. On this subject my nerves are most susceptible.

[Page 58]
Ebo. You must hear all. It is not enough that I am doomed to be the victim of policy. Even my virtue is attacked. Long have I been persecuted by the shameful passion of the great voluptuary. This letter will unmask [700]   the saint. (Carlos takes it, and attends with such impatience to her narrative, that he forgets to read it.) Where shall I take refuge, prince? Till now, my virtue has been guarded by my pride, but at last—
Car. At last you yielded. No, no, no—for heaven's sake, no.
Ebo. Yielded! To whom? How weak are man's ideas, when the subject of them is a woman's favours!—Love can only be purchased by itself. Throughout this spacious earth, love is the price of love. It is the invaluable jewel, which the owner must bestow as a gift, or bury it, that no one may enjoy it—like the great merchant, who in contempt of all the gold which kings could offer, restored his pearls to the rich ocean, rather than sell them for less than their value.
Car. (Aside.) By heaven, she is most lovely.
Ebo. Call it a whim, or vanity, or—what you please. I shall not grant shares of my affection. To the only man, whom I think worthy of my choice, I shall give every thing. One, and one only, can Eboli make happy, but that one will be a God. The enchanting harmony of souls, the kiss of rapture, the voluptuous embrace, are each a leaf belonging to a beauteous flower. Shall I then madly strip this flower of its ornaments? Shall I degrade the majesty of woman, that I may sweeten the evening of a [725]   libertine.
Car. (Aside.) Incredible! Has such a woman existed in Madrid—and have I not discovered her till now?
Ebo. Long since should I have forsaken this court—nay, this world, and should have taken refuge in a convent, but a single tie remains which binds me to the world. Alas! I
[Page 59]
am, perhaps, misled by a phantom, but to me this phantom is invaluable. I love, and am—not beloved.
Car. (Flies towards her with ardour.) You are, you are. By my soul I swear you are beyond description loved.
Ebo. You swear! You! That was an angel's voice. Yes, if you swear that I am beloved,—then I believe it, Carlos.
Car. (Clasps her in his arms.) Sweet emblem of sensibility —adorable being! I am lost in ecstasy and wonder. Who on this earth can boast that he has seen you, and has never loved? But what can you do here—here at the court of Philip, among monks and sycophants. This is not the proper climate for a flower so lovely. Soon will they attempt to pluck it—but no, they shall not—as I live they shall not. In these arms I'll bear you through a host of demons. Yes—let me be your guardian angel.
Ebo. (With a look of the warmest affection.) Oh Carlos, how little have I known you, yet how boundless is the recompence your heart bestows for the trouble of diving into [750]   its recesses! (Attempts to kiss his hand.)
Car. (Drawing it back.) What mean you, Princess?
Ebo. (Gazing intently at his hand.) How beauteous is that hand, and oh, how rich!—Two precious gifts can it bestow —a diadem, and the heart of Carlos—both, perhaps, on one mortal. Great, heavenly gift! Almost too much for one. How if you divide them, Prince. A queen seldom loves sincerely, and she, who loves sincerely seldom understands the duties of a queen. Better were it, therefore, to divide the gifts. And why not do it now?—Perhaps you have. Oh, if this be the case, name to me the happy fair one.
Car. I will. Sweet, lovely, unaffected girl, to you I will discover all. You are the only one, at this court, who can entirely understand me.—Well then, I own—I love—
Ebo. Tormenting man! Was it so difficult to own this? Must I be an object of compassion because you love me?

[Page 60]
Car. (Starts.) What means this?
Ebo. How could you thus torture me? How could you deny that you received my key?
Car. Key!—What do I hear?—But—true—oh God! (His knees totter—he sinks into a chair, and hides his face.)
Ebo. Oh! What have I done? (Falls.)
Car. Plunged thus low—into the unfathomable gulph of despair!—Oh, horrible!
Ebo. (Hiding her face.) What a discovery! Oh heavens!
Car. (Kneels at her side.) I am not guilty, Princess. [775]   My passions—an unfortunate misunderstanding.
Ebo. (Pushes him back.) Away from my sight!
Car. I cannot leave you in this dreadful agitation.
Ebo. (Forcibly pushing him away.) If you have any compassion or generosity, begone. Would you murder me? The sight of you is death. Give me my letter, and my key —then go.—Where is the other letter?
Car. What other?
Ebo. The King's.
Car. (Starts.) Whose?
Ebo. That which I put into your hand.
Car. From the king! And to whom? To you?
Ebo. Oh heavens! In what a labyrinth have I involved myself. Return the letter. I must have it.
Car. That letter—which will unmask the saint—is it that you want?
Ebo. Oh, I shall die. Return it instantly.
Car. (Draws it forth.) No, Princess. This is an invaluable treasure, (Holds it up triumphantly) which all the realms of Philip cannot purchase. This letter I shall keep. (Going.)
Ebo. (Rushes between him and the door.) Merciful heavens! Should you act thus meanly, I am lost.
Car. (Takes her hand with a dignified composure.) Princess
[Page 61]
Eboli, when I act meanly,—then, and not till then, I allow you to blush for what has happened.
                                         [Exit. Ebo. [800]   Another word, Don Carlos—but a single word.— He is gone—he despises me.—Here am I left alone—rejected and despised. (Sinks on the sofa.) Rejected in favour of a rival!—There is now no doubt; he himself avowed his love. But who is the happy fair one? Thus much is plain—his attachment is improper, for the fears detection, and carefully conceals his passion from the King. Is it not the father, whom he fears in Philip? How transported was he, when I betrayed the secret of the King's advances!—How happened it that his rigid virtue was on this occasion silent?— What can he gain if the Queen were thus to be— (Suddenly pauses—her looks indicate that some extraordinary idea has occurred to her. She draws forth the ribband which she took from Carlos, and instantly recognizes it.) Fool, fool that I have been!—Where were my senses?— The scales fall from my eyes. They had been attached to each other long before the King married her. The Prince never saw me but when she was also present.—She, therefore, was the object of that boundless love, which I was blind enough to think he felt for me. Oh unexampled deception! I have betrayed my weakness too.—— (A pause.) That his passion should be quite hopeless I can hardly think. Hopeless love cannot exist in such a case. He had liberty to revel in these charms, which even a monarch courted—he refused this——such a sacrifice could not have been offered by a hopeless lover. How tenderly he pressed me to his beating heart! Affection, if not returned, could not have resisted such temptation as I offered.——Let me reflect. [825]   He accepts the key which he conceives was sent to him by the Queen—he relies on this gigantic stride of love, and comes. Of course, therefore, he supposes Philip's wife might have done this, and this supposition must be founded upon previous facts.—It is clear, it is clear. She loves him—this
[Page 62]
saint, this emblem of sanctity loves Carlos.—I have trembled in the presence of this virtuous Queen, have thought her supernatural, and have felt myself extinguished by the splendour of her virtues. And was the composure which I so often have beheld with wonder—was it a mask?—Yes. She wishes to enjoy two tables—she wishes to appear at the creditable board of virtue, and likewise revel at the secret feast of vice. And shall this bold attempt succeed? Shall it be unrevenged?—No, no. That shall it not, by heaven. The King shall be acquainted with this gross deception.—The King (After reflecting awhile.) Right!—That is the surest road to his ear. (Rings the bell.)
Enter a Page . Ebo. There is a ball at court this evening—is there not?
Page. Yes, Princess. The company has already begun to assemble.
Ebo. If you could draw the confessor aside—
Page. Father Domingo, do you mean?
Ebo. The same. Request him to step into the apartment on the left, till I can conveniently follow him. Say that an event of consequence has taken place, and we must meet.
Page. [850]   I shall obey your orders.
                                         [Exit. Ebo. (Paces the room with a dejected air, then stops.) But why should I despond?—I am not totally forsaken.— One lover I retain, and that a monarch. How many thousands are there, who would be happy if they possessed the shadow of my situation!—Why am I thus dissatisfied? Is it true that happiness depends on mutual love?—Nay, if it be, why should I think of love on this occasion? Is not my pride insulted—and can it be silenced by the accents of a hopeless passion? No. The King alone can execute the vengeance which my soul demands. (Is going, but loses herself in meditation.) Virtue! He, for whom I have reserved
[Page 63]
it, has refused the gift. If the flowers of virtue be not gathered by the hand of love, what is their value? Nothing. I am not allowed to love. Adieu, therefore, to all the hopes which I had founded on affection. Be my present idol—vengeance. I will love no more.
                                         [Exit. Scene Scene , an apartment in the Palace. It is evening, and the room is but feebly lighted. Enter Alba and Domingo from opposite sides. Dom. Is it you, Duke Alba?—Good evening to you.
Alba. Hold! Who mentioned my name?
Dom. For whom are you looking?
Alba. It is Domingo.—Alone, too!—You vanished from the room, without a moment's notice, and I have been in search of you some time.
Dom. Does his Majesty want me?
Alba. No. I myself wished to converse with you, but I am not in haste. Doubtless you expect some one.—Dare I [875]   know who it is?
Dom. What was your business with me?
Alba. I wished to ask an explanation of a strange circumstance which occurred to-day.
Dom. Pray proceed.
Alba. Don Carlos and I met each other at noon in the Queen's antichamber. He insulted me—we became loud— and at last drew our swords. The Queen heard the noise, rushed from her room between us, and with a look of firm authority riveted her eye upon the Prince. It was a momentary look, but instantly he dropped his sword, presented me his hand, and disappeared.
Dom. (After a pause.) This was strange. Duke, you remind me of suspicions, which have long had their place in my mind, though as yet I have not entrusted them to any
[Page 64]
one. There are double friends, which may be compared to two-edged scymitars—I like not these. It is difficult to pry into the heart of man, therefore I concealed my secret till a proper opportunity of stating it occurred. Besides, who knows but I may be deceived, for man is often erroneous in his conjectures. I am a priest—it is my vocation rather to promote peace than enmity. The latter I leave to those whom it better suits. Different servants have different employments. Duty may command Duke Alba to do that, which would in Domingo be most culpable. I must be silent, [900]   were the certainty still greater than it is.
Alba. Certainty!—I know not what you mean. All I have said is scarcely a foundation for a probability.
Dom. Of what avail is that conviction, which I dare not publish? To render certain services to kings is dangerous, Duke. If the arrow which you shoot be not precisely aimed, it is certain to recoil upon yourself. What I say, I would confirm by oath and by the sacrament, but a witness, a single word, a scrap of paper, would weigh more than all my evidence. Pity it is we live in Spain.
Alba. Why so?
Dom. Because in other courts gallantry may be more open—here it is confined by rigid laws. The Queens of Spain find it difficult to sin, especially in that respect, which best would answer the purpose of detection.
Alba. True. We must, therefore—
Dom. On one scheme I must allow that I have founded hopes. Should this succeed———May I repeat to the Princess Eboli what you have mentioned?
Alba. I wished to see you on this subject. The discovery is of great consequence to me—of greater than you, perhaps, suspect. Something happened to-day——I hope we understand each other, reverend father.
Dom. My opinion of Don Carlos you well know.

[Page 65]
Alba. I have never thought him dangerous—nor do I yet, [925]   but if there be a mortal whom I could allow myself to fear, this boy is he.
Dom. Duke, you touch a string—
Alba. Hear me.—We are in danger. The King this morning mentioned——but a few words, and I trust you know that words are not apt to make me tremble, reverend father.—Yet in these words much might be comprehended. Already does he waver between us and the Infant—a reconciliation has almost taken place.
Dom. A reconciliation! Heaven forbid!
Alba. He declares that Carlos shall henceforth be nearer to his throne. Me he commanded—at least it sounded thus —to beg of his proud son that I might still continue in the father's favour.
Dom. You make me uneasy, Duke.
Alba. The audience was long. Loudly (for I heard him when I was in the cabinet) he entreated that the King would send him as commander to the Netherlands. When I saw him I observed he had been weeping. At noon he met me with an air of joy, congratulated me, and expressed his satisfaction at the preference which the King had shewn to me. I am sure he never was a hypocrite. How, therefore, must I reconcile these contradictions? The Prince rejoices in the denial of his wish, and his father confers on me the honour with every mark of anger.—What am I to [950]   think? The dignity, with which I am invested, rather resembles banishment than favour.
Dom. Heavens! Is this our situation? In a moment is the building destroyed, to raise which we have employed whole years?—Yet are you so calm?—Do you know this youth? Do you suspect what will be our lot, should he attain any power? He hates you.
Alba. That I can forgive, for our sensations are so far
[Page 66]
mutual—but he despises me—that I will never pardon. Last year, when the assembled states of Arragon did homage to him, and the turn reached me, I was not present, for my office as marshal had elsewhere detained me. Thrice had the herald summoned me ere I appeared before the throne—but how was I received?—The Infant spurned me from him. In the presence of Arragon he refused to let me kiss his hand. All eyes were turned upon me, and for the first time in my life I was embarrassed. At that time I swore my vengeance should be horrible—and horrible it shall be.
Dom. I am not his enemy. Other cares oppress my mind—cares for the throne, for God, and for religion. I know the Infant—I have looked into his soul, and am convinced he has a mean opinion of our holy church.
Alba. I fear he has too high an opinion of it, for methinks he knows not yet how useful it may be made.
Dom. [975]   His heart glows with an independent novel virtue, which seeks no support in faith. Vice produces millions to the church. This support he holds in abhorrence and contempt. To be brief, he thinks —his mind is inflamed with strange chimeras—he respects what are called the rights of human nature———Is it fit that such a man should be our King?
Alba. These are mere phantoms—perhaps arising from a wish to be singular. Far different will be his sentiments, when he is vested with despotic power.
Dom. That I doubt. He is proud of freedom, unaccustomed to constraint, and therefore not likely to purchase it. Is such a man fit for the Spanish throne? His gigantic mind will instantly erase the laws of our state policy. In vain have I endeavoured to enervate his firm mind by the fascinations of voluptuousness. He has counteracted my attempts. The secret of relieving an overburdened conscience
[Page 67]
he despised. Such a mind, with such a constitution, is to be dreaded, and Philip is now sixty years of age.
Alba. You look far into futurity.
Dom. He and the Queen agree in sentiment. The poison of innovation has crept into the breasts of both. If it gain ground, the throne will be in danger. I do not like this Valois.
Alba. (Dejected.) Why remind me of her? You have [1000]   roused a recollection which I wished to have concealed even from myself for ever.
Dom. What may it be? You seem much agitated.
Alba. The Queen of Spain once wounded me so deeply, that the blood which she drew forth will stain my reputation during whole centuries. She it was—for my spies have at last dived into the mystery—she alone it was who betrayed my project of drawing the Prince of Bourbon from Navarre —a project which, to the Spanish monarch, was of no smaller consequence than a rich kingdom. She apprised France of my intention—the plan was defeated—and I was made the butt of ridicule.
Dom. I am acquainted with this circumstance. Should Philip relax in his authority, you may dread the vengeance of this secret foe. As yet, Fortune is in our favour. Let us avail ourselves of this, and at one blow destroy the Queen and Infant. A hint must be immediately given to the King —whether at first supported by proof is immaterial. We have gained much if we but make him waver. As to ourselves, we have no doubts, and those, who are themselves convinced, find no great difficulty in convincing others. We are certain to discover more, if we have formed a resolution that we will. I have in view another source.—— Was it not in January that the Queen was brought to bed? Right—and it was only in April of the former year that the [1025]   King recovered from his dangerous fever. Duke Alba,
[Page 68]
you understand me. This little seed shall produce a plenteous crop of jealousy—but we must be patient.
Alba. But now to the principal question. Who takes upon him the task of exciting the King to—
Dom. Neither you, nor I—but in digesting this plan, I have not failed to provide, with silent diligence, a proper person. The King loves the Princess Eboli, and I encourage this passion, because it forwards my views. I am his ambassador at present, and will instruct the Princess how to act. If I succeed, we shall, I hope, have in this lady a most powerful friend—perhaps a future queen. She herself has summoned me to meet her here.—My hopes are great. In one night a Spanish girl may perhaps destroy this lily of Valois.
Alba. May I believe this?—By heavens, you surprise me much. This promises a quick completion of our wishes. Domingo, I revere you highly. Our game is won.
Dom. Hold! Some one approaches.
Alba. That I, who have grown grey in the defence of Philip, should be obliged to use a woman's influence, is torture to me, but the blush which overspreads my face, this boy shall pay for—
Dom. Go, go. 'Tis she herself.
Alba. I shall be in the next room if you—
Dom. [1050]   Enough! I'll call you.                                          [Exit Alba. Enter Eboli . I am at your service, Princess.
Ebo. (Looks round.) Are we alone?
Dom. Quite so.
Ebo. Who left you just now?
Dom. Duke Alba, who requests the honour of paying his respects to you, when you are at liberty.

[Page 69]
Ebo. Duke Alba! What can he want with me? Do you know?
Dom. Can I confess that, 'till I know what has procured me an interview which is so rare? Perhaps some circumstance has at length made you more inclined to the King's wishes. Perhaps, mature consideration has reconciled you to an offer, which momentary caprice induced you to refuse. I come, full of expectation—
Ebo. Did you report my last answer to the King?
Dom. Hitherto I have forborne to inflict a wound so severe. Perhaps, Princess, you may now condescend to be more indulgent.
Ebo. Tell the King that I expect him.
Dom. May I believe this, Princess?
Ebo. Do you suppose I mean not what I say?—Heavens! You alarm me. What have I done that even you must blush?
Dom. Princess, this surprise——scarcely can I comprehend [1075]   what you avow—
Ebo. Good father, it is not my intention that you should. Enough is it for you that I accept the offer of King Philip. You may save yourself the trouble of trying to discover why I do so. For your consolation, I will allow that your eloquence had no effect on me, though you declared that there were cases in which the church thought proper to use the persons of its younger daughters for purposes beyond my comprehension. These pious arguments are, I must own, too high for me.
Dom. With pleasure I retract them, Princess, as soon as I perceive they are not necessary.
Ebo. I wish you, in my name, to beg that his Majesty will not mistake me upon this occasion. I am still what I have been, though the situation of affairs is changed. When I refused his offer with disdain, I thought him happy in
[Page 70]
possessing a most amiable consort, and believed this faithful partner was worthy of the sacrifice I made. Such was then my opinion, but now I know better than to found any renunciation upon such fallacious principles.
Dom. Proceed, Princess, proceed. We understand each other.
Ebo. I have detected the sly pilferer, and will be no longer silent. She has imposed upon the King, me, and all Spain. She loves, and is beloved. I can produce proofs of this— [1100]   proofs which will make her tremble. The King is grossly imposed upon, but he shall be revenged. I will tear away the mask of virtue, which this pretended saint has worn, and exhibit to the world her guilty countenance. This triumph I must purchase at a dreadful price, but I glory in the thought that it will cost her more.
Dom. Our plan is ripe. Allow me to call the Duke.
                                         [Goes. Ebo. (Astonished.) What means this?
Re-enter Alba , preceded by Domingo . Dom. Our intelligence arrives too late, Duke Alba. The Princess Eboli has disclosed to me the secret, which we intended she should learn from us.
Alba. My visit will be less surprising then. I dared not credit my own eyes; for such discoveries require the piercing penetration of a female.
Ebo. To what discoveries do you refer?
Dom. Princess, we wish to know what time and place will better suit you—
Ebo. Right! I shall expect you to-morrow noon at my apartments. I have reasons for no longer concealing this secret from the King.
Alba. This it was, which brought me hither. The King must be acquainted with it instantly. He must learn it,
[Page 71]
too, from you, for upon whose testimony will he be so willing to rely? You are the vigilant companion of the Queen—
Dom. [1125]   And, when you please, may be the uncontrolled companion of the King.
Alba. I am declared to be the foe of Carlos.
Dom. The same is said of me—but not of Princess Eboli. We are obliged to be silent, while the duties of your situation compel you to speak. Be you our leader, and believe me we shall soon attain our end.
Alba. But we must be decisive. Every moment is precious. In another hour I may be ordered to depart.
Dom. (After a pause, turns to Eboli.) Might not letters be found—letters from the Prince? These would assist us greatly. Let me consider—ay—true. You sleep, I think, in the same apartment with the Queen.
Ebo. In the one next to it. But what of this?
Dom. Have you ever observed where she keeps the key of her cabinet?
Ebo. (After a pause.) That might be of use.—Yes. I think the key might be found.
Dom. Letters must be conveyed by messengers. The Queen's establishment is great—but is there no one who has excited your suspicion?—Gold can do much—
Alba. Perhaps the Infant has some friend.
Dom. Not one in all Madrid.
Alba. That is strange.
Dom. It is so, but you may rely upon it, he despises the [1150]   whole court. I have proofs of this.
Alba. But hold!—It just occurs to me that as I left the apartments of the Queen, I saw the Prince in private conversation with a page.
Ebo. That—that was on another subject.

[Page 72]
Dom. Another subject! How can this be known. The circumstance is really suspicious. (To Alba.) Did you know the page.
Ebo. Pshaw!—I know this conversation was of no importance. ——We shall see each other again, then, before I speak to the King. In the mean time, much may be discovered.
Dom. (Leads her apart.) And may I announce to his Majesty that he may hope? Will you deign to add the happy hour at which his wishes will be gratified?
Ebo. In a few days I shall feign indisposition. On such occasions the sick attendant is always removed from the person of her Majesty. I shall, then, be at my own apartments.
Dom. Oh glorious day! Our game is won. I bid defiance to all Queens on earth. (A bell is heard.)
Ebo. Hark! The Queen rings for me.—Farewel.
                                         [Exit. Dom. (Follows her with his eyes for some time.) Duke Alba, those charms, combined with your services—
Alba. And supported by your religion.—What can resist [1175]   such a confederacy?
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene , a room in a Carthusian convent. Enter Carlos and Prior . Car. He has already been here. I am sorry for it.
Prior. In the course of this morning he has thrice been here—the last time but an hour ago.
Car. Did he not say he would return?
Pri. Yes. He said I might expect him before noon.
Car. (Walks to the window.) Your convent is in a retired situation. To the right I perceive the steeples of Madrid, and here flows the Mansanares. I like your situation. All is here as silent and secret—

[Page 73]
Pri. As the entrance to the next world.
Car. To you, worthy man, I have entrusted a secret of the greatest importance. No one living must know or even suspect with whom I here have held a private conference. I have many reasons for concealing my acquaintance with the man whom I expect. Therefore, I fixed upon your convent. We are, I trust, secure against surprise and treachery. You remember your vow.
Pri. Rely upon me, Prince. Even the suspicion of kings will not pry into these living tombs. The ear of curiosity is stationed at the door of Fortune and of Pleasure. When you entered our portals, you left the world.
Car. If you think this timidity and caution are caused by a bad conscience, you are much mistaken, holy father.
Pri. I do not think at all upon the subject.
Car. [1200]   I tremble that my secret should be known to man, but not to God.
Pri. That is to us of little consequence, my son. This asylum is open to the guilty as well as to the guiltless. Whether your intentions be good or bad, upright or criminal, you must settle with your own conscience.
Car. (With ardour.) Heaven cannot be displeased with our intentions. The fairest, loveliest work of all creation.— In you I may confide.
Pri. To what end. Pardon me, Prince, if I decline your confidence. The world and all its vanities I have long renounced. I employ my time in preparations for the journey, which I soon must undertake. The bell calls me to prayers. Heaven be with you, Prince!
                                         [Exit. Enter Posa . Car. Ha!—At last, at last we meet.
Posa. How have you tried the patience of a friend!— Twice has the sun risen and set, since your fate, my Carlos,
[Page 74]
was decided, and as yet I am in total ignorance respecting it. Can this be forgiven?
Car. This reproach from Roderigo! What have I not felt during the interval!
Posa. Enough. Be all forgotten. Now accept my best congratulations. You and your father are reconciled.
Car. How!
Posa. And your departure for Flanders is resolved upon.
Car. [1225]   That Duke Alba shall depart to-morrow is resolved upon.
Posa. Impossible!—Is all Madrid deceived? It is said that you had a private audience, and the King—
Car. Was deaf to my petition. We are for ever separated —further from each other than we were before.
Posa. You do not go to Flanders, then?
Car. No, no, no.
Posa. Oh my hopes!
Car. Roderigo, what torments have I suffered since I last conversed with you!—What wonderous tidings have I to communicate! But at present, let me claim your aid in obtaining me an interview. I must see her.
Posa. Your mother!—No.—To what end?
Car. I have hopes——you turn pale. Be at ease. I shall and will be happy.—Tell me, tell me, how can I obtain an interview.
Posa. What means this feverish dream?
Car. It is not a dream. No, by the Almighty it is reality—it is reality. (Draws forth Philip's letter to Eboli.) This paper contains the important truth. The Queen is free—released from her vow in the eyes of God and man. There! Read that, and cease to be astonished.
Posa. (Opens it.) What do I see?—The King's own hand! (After having perused it.) To whom was this [1250]   written?

[Page 75]
Car. To the Princess Eboli. Two days ago, a letter and a key were brought to me by one of the Queen's pages. I was invited to the left wing of the palace, in which are her Majesty's apartments, and was informed that a lady whom I long had loved would there receive me. Instantly I obeyed the signal.
Posa. Madman!
Car. I did not know the writing, but knew there was only one person to whom the description could be applied. Who but she could think herself beloved by Carlos? I flew to the place, anticipating bliss unutterable. Celestial music, which stole upon my ear from the appointed chamber, was my guide. I opened the door—but judge what were my sensations when I beheld—
Posa. Oh, I see through the whole.
Car. I was irrecoverably lost had I not fallen into an angel's hands. But what a luckless accident! Deceived by the incautious language of my eyes, she thought herself the object of my passion, and her gentle heart, pitying my silent sorrows, determined to reward me. Respect appeared to seal my lips—she, therefore, summoned resolution to address me —and her soul lay open to my view.
Posa. Is it possible that you can relate this so calmly?— The Princess Eboli penetrated to the inmost recesses of your [1275]   mind. Oh, there is no doubt but she discovered your attachment. You have mortified a woman's pride—and that woman's influence over Philip is boundless.
Car. She is virtuous.
Posa. To a certain degree. I know her virtue, and I fear it. How little does it resemble that, which, with luxuriant grace, springs from the mind's parental soil, and without a cultivator's aid expands its voluntary blossoms! Her virtue is a foreign plant, reared by artificial means, in a climate which suits it not.—Judge, whether such a woman can forgive that a man, who refused the offer of her charms,
[Page 76]
should waste his life in hopeless wishes to possess King Philip's wife.
Car. Are you so thoroughly acquainted with the principles of Eboli?
Posa. I cannot say I am, for I have not seen her more than twice; but allow me to remark that I fancied she was skilful in the management of her passions, and valued herself not a little on her virtue. Then I beheld the Queen— Oh Carlos, what a different being! Unacquainted with the affected form of etiquette; equally a stranger to timidity or boldness, she walks with silent inborn dignity on the small path of strict propriety, ignorant that she is adored by all, because not conscious of her own superiority. Does Carlos recognise his Eboli in this description? The Princess was [1300]   firm, because she loved. You did not reward her passion— therefore she will fall.
Car. No, no. (Walks up and down with a disordered air.) No, I say.—Does it become you, Roderigo, thus to deprive me of my greatest comfort—a confidence in human nature?
Posa. Do I deserve this accusation?—No, dearest friend. I would not rob you of such a comfort. Eboli would have been an angel, and with reverence would I have prostrated myself at her feet, had she not—learnt your secret.
Car. How vain are your fears! Has she any other proofs than such as would expose herself, were they revealed? Will she purchase the sad pleasure of revenge with her own honour?
Posa. Many have acted thus.
Car. No. You are too rigid, too severe. She is proud, and has a noble mind. I know her, and am not afraid. In vain do you endeavour to alarm my hopes. I must see my mother.
Posa. Now!—Of what use—

[Page 77]
Car. I have nothing more to fear. I must know my fate.—Procure me an interview.
Posa. And you mean to shew her that letter?
Car. Ask me no more questions, but procure me an interview.
Posa. (Significantly.) [1325]   Did you not tell me that you loved your mother?—Yet, you would shew her that. (Carlos fixes his eyes on the earth.) Carlos, there is something unusual in your conduct. You turn away. Why turn away from me?—But did I understand the letter? Let me look at it again. (Carlos presents the letter, and Posa tears it.)
Car. How! Are you mad? (Suppressing his anger) I must own—Roderigo—the letter was of essential consequence to me.
Posa. I thought so, therefore I tore it. (Surveys him long with a penetrating eye.) Tell me—what has a pollution of the royal bed to do with your—attachment? Was Philip dangerous to you? What connexion exists between the infidelity of Philip, and your bold hopes? Will the pangs of her you love be any gratification to you?—Yes. Now I begin to know you. How little did I understand the nature of your passion!
Car. How, Roderigo! Can you think thus meanly of me?
Posa. It was once otherwise. I can recollect the time when your heart could find room for a whole world. This is now at an end. One selfish solitary passion has corrupted you. Not a tear do you shed for the unfortunate devoted Netherlands. Oh Carlos, how poor, how little is the man, who loves no one but himself!
Car. (Falls into a chair, and can scarcely check his tears.) [1350]   I feel that I have lost your regard.
Posa. That is not the case, for I know the meaning of your conduct. It was an error into which you were led by
[Page 78]
praiseworthy sensations. The Queen was betrothed to you, and King Philip seized the prize; but till now you doubted whether you had any solid claim. Philip, you thought, was perhaps worthy of her.—It was only at intervals that you decided in your own favour. This letter at once convinced you that you were more worthy, and with proud delight you anticipated the consequences. You gloried in being injured, for exalted souls are pleased when persecuted. But here imagination has misled you. Your pride felt satisfied, and you gave way to hope. On this occasion you misunderstood yourself.
Car. (Much affected.) No, Roderigo, my sentiments were not so noble as you think them.
Posa. No more. I can always discover virtue even at the bottom of your faults. But now that we better understand each other, mark me. You shall see the Queen—you must see her. I pledge to you my word that I will procure you an interview.
Car. (Falls on his neck.) Friend of my soul, scarcely can I look at thee.
Posa. Are you sure that my motive for acting thus is proper. May I not be influenced by secret wishes, or by [1375]   interest, or even by fear? But more of this another time. I have promised. Leave the rest to me. A bold and happy thought just darts across my mind. You shall hear it from lovelier lips, Carlos. I shall find my way into the presence of the Queen. Perhaps your wishes may be accomplished to-morrow. Till then, Carlos, forget not that a project dictated by heaven, for the relief of human nature, though ten thousand times defeated, still calls for perseverance.— Remember Flanders.
Car. I will do any thing which you and virtue can enjoin.
Posa. (Goes to the window.) We must part. I hear
[Page 79]
your attendants. (They embrace.) Now we must be again the Prince and vassal.
Car. You go to Madrid immediately, I hope?
Posa. Immediately.
Car. Hold! Another word! I must mention one important circumstance, which had almost escaped my memory. All letters for Brabant are opened by the King. Be on your guard. Private orders have been sent to the post-office—
Posa. How did you learn this?
Car. Don Raimond de Taxis is my friend.
Posa. (After a pause.) Be it so. We can send our dispatches through Germany.
                                         [Exeunt severally.

END OF ACT II.

[Page 80]
ACT III. Scene Scene , the King's bedchamber. On one side is a niche, before which curtains are drawn—on the other a table, upon which two candles are burning. At the back part of the chamber several Pages are seen asleep upon their knees. The King, half undressed, is seated at the table in an attitude of meditation. Before him lie a miniature, and several papers. King. (In a reverie.) That she has always been romantic, who can deny?—Never could I feel any regard for her, yet did she ever seem to feel the want of this regard?—It is evident, then, she is false. (An involuntary motion rouses him—he looks round with surprise.) Where am I?—Is no one awake but the King?—How!—The candles are almost entirely burnt; yet surely it cannot be day. (Presses the spring of his repeater, which strikes four.) I cannot sleep. Be satisfied with this, oh nature, and do not claim thy due. Kings have no time to make amends for sleepless nights. I am awake—and now it shall be day. (Extinguishes the candles, draws up a window-curtain, and as he paces the apartment perceives the boys who are asleep. He gazes at them for some time, then rings.) Perhaps my attendants in the antichamber are asleep too.
Enter Lerma . Ler. (Starts.) Is your Majesty not well?
King. The left wing of the palace has been on fire. Did you hear no alarm?
Ler. None whatever.

[Page 81]
King. How! Was it but a dream, then?—Such a dream cannot be the effect of chance. Does not the Queen sleep in that wing?
Ler. She does, my Liege.
King. This dream has quite alarmed me. Let the centinels be doubled there at the approach of evening—but mark me, this must be done privately, for I wish not——Why [25]   do you gaze at me thus?
Ler. Your eyes are much inflamed, and call for rest. Dare I entreat your Majesty to recollect the value of your life. Dare I remind you of your subjects, who with fearful anxiety would read in your disordered looks that their monarch had not slept? Would not even two short hours of repose—
King. Tear the scorpion from my pillow———I will not close my eyes. While asleep, the King may lose his diadem—the husband his wife's affections!—I will not sleep.
Ler. Is it your Majesty's pleasure that I should wake the Pages?
King. No. I can trust them better when asleep. While in a torpid state, this boy forgets his father's blood flowed to appease King Philip's just resentment. Is this proper? Could no attendant be selected in my wide domains, except the culprit's son, whom I condemned to die?
Ler. My Liege, they are children—
King. No, no. It is false. Was not a woman my authority? —Woman, thy name is calumny. No crime is certain till a man confirms the truth of it. (To the Pages, who are now awake.) Send for Duke Alba.—
                                         [Exeunt Pages. Come nearer, Count. Is it true? (Rivets his eyes upon Lerma.) Oh! that I could be certain, were it only for a moment.
[Page 82]
[50]   —Swear! Is it true? Am I deceived? Am I imposed upon?
Ler. Most gracious monarch—
King. Monarch! King! Liege!—Is this all you can say—this empty unavailing echo! I have struck against a rock, because I thirst, and must have water. My fever will destroy me.
Ler. To what do you refer, my Liege?
King. To nothing. Go—leave me.——But hold. You are, methinks, a husband and a father.
Ler. I am.
King. What! Are you married, and dare you venture to leave your bed, that you may guard your King? Your head is silvered over, yet you place confidence in woman!— Go home, go home. You will find your incestuous wife clasped in your son's arms. Believe me, and go home.— You seem surprised—and look significantly at your King.— Is it because my head is silvered too? Wretch, remember Queens are inviolable. Your suspicion is treason.
Ler. (With ardour.) Treason of which I never shall be guilty. Throughout King Philip's realms, where is the man who dares, with poisonous breath, to say one word reflecting on the best of Queens?
King. The best! You too call her the best! I find her zealous friends are nearest to my person. She must have paid [75]   well for this—more than I conceived she could pay.—You have leave to depart. Let the Duke come.
Ler. I already hear him in the antichamber. (Going.)
King. (In a milder tone.) Count, I believe that your first remark was just. Want of sleep has scorched my brain. Forget what I have said throughout my waking dream. Do you hear? Forget it. I am your gracious King. (Presents his hand, which Lerma kisses, then bows, opens the door for Alba, and exit.)

[Page 83]
Enter Alba . Alba. (Approaches with a doubtful mien.) An order so unexpected, at so extraordinary an hour— (Starts on examining the King more minutely,) and this look—
King. (Has seated himself, and taken up the miniature. For a long time he silently surveys the Duke.) It is true, then? I have no longer any faithful servant?
Alba. (Astonished, turns aside.) How!
King. I am wounded in my tenderest part. Every one knew what danger threatened me, and no one warned me of it.
Alba. (With a look of astonishment.) Could any thing escape my eye, which threatened to disturb my Monarch's peace?
King. (Shews him letters.) Do you know this hand?
Alba. It is the Infant's.
King. (Looks stedfastly at Alba.) Have you no suspicions? You told me to be upon my guard against his ambition? Was his ambition all I had to fear?
Alba. Ambition is a word of most extensive meaning.
King. [100]   Have you, then, nothing to impart?
Alba. (With an air of reserve.) Your Majesty has entrusted your crown to my vigilance, and when I had sufficient grounds for fancying that its interest was endangered, I have ever spoken freely. What, in other respects, I fancy, or know, belongs to myself. This is a sacred property which even a purchased slave has a right to withhold from the kings of earth.—Every thing which is clear to me may not be ripe for the ear of Majesty; but if you wish to be satisfied, I must beg you will not call upon me as my King.
King. (Gives him the letters.) Read those.
Alba. (Reads, and turns with a look of alarm to the King.) Who was mad enough to place these fatal papers in my Monarch's hand?

[Page 84]
King. What!—You know then who is meant in the contents? —I observed the name was purposely omitted.
Alba. (Starts.) I have been too hasty.
King. You know the person?
Alba. (After a pause.) I have divulged it. My King commands, and I no longer hesitate. Yes. I do know the person.
King. (Rises in dreadful agitation.) Assist me, God of vengeance, assist me in the invention of new torments.— So clear, so public is the circumstance, that it was understood almost without a hint.—This is too much. I, then, am the last acquainted with it—the last in my dominions.
Alba. (Falls at the King's feet.) [125]   Most gracious Monarch, I acknowledge my transgression. I am ashamed of that base policy, which hitherto has bound my tongue, while the honour of my sovereign, justice, and truth, commanded me to speak. Yes—as all are silent, as the enchantments of beauty have bound every tongue, I will speak, though well I know that the insinuating asseverations of a son, the charms and overpowering tears of a wife—
King. Rise!—You have my royal promise it shall not be so. Rise, and speak without alarm.
Alba. (Rises.) Your Majesty may perhaps recollect what happened in the gardens at Aranjeuz. You found the Queen alone , in a retired place, and with disordered looks.
King. Ha! What shall I hear? Proceed.
Alba. The Marchioness of Mondecar was banished from the court, because she possessed sufficient generosity to sacrifice herself for the Queen. We are now acquainted with particulars. The Marchioness had done no more than was commanded. Don Carlos had been there.
King. Ha!—How know you this?
Alba. The footsteps of a man were printed in the sand, near to the Queen's pavilion—nay, near the grotto which is close to it, lay a handkerchief known to be the Infant's.
[Page 85]
A gardener met him too, and at the very time your Majesty arrived. He was retreating—
King. [150]   And she was in tears. Yet—when I seemed surprised, she wept, and made me blush in presence of the court. By heaven her virtue awed me. (Seats himself, and hides his face.) Yes, Duke—you are right—this discovery may lead to something horrible.
Alba. My Liege, this does not absolutely prove—
King. (Holding forth the papers.) Nor this—nor this— nor this.—Do all these damning proofs mean nothing?— Oh, it is clearer than the light of day. Their incestuous intercourse began even from the very time that you delivered her to me.
Alba. Don Carlos, when he gained a mother, lost a bride. Already had she indulged the warm wishes which her new rank forbad. Fear, which usually accompanies the first confession, was removed; and recollection fanned the flame, which raged in both their bosoms. Allied to each other by equality of years, and similarity of thinking; mutually incensed at the loss of each other's hand; they boldly gay way to those sensations which policy had opposed. Is it credible, my Liege, that she should patiently submit to the decision of a cabinet; that, after expecting the object of her love, she should be satisfied with a——diadem?
King. (Offended.) You make very sage distinctions, Duke. I admire your rhetoric, and thank you. (Rises, with a cold and haughty mien.) You are right. The [175]   Queen has erred in concealing from me letters of such a nature, as well as in suppressing her unjustifiable interview with the Prince. Her false generosity has misled her. I shall know what punishment is necessary. (Rings.) Who else is in the antichamber? You are no longer wanted, Duke. Withdraw.
Alba. Can my zeal have a second time displeased my King?

[Page 86]
King. (To a Page, who enters.) Send Domingo hither.                                          [Exit Page. I forgive you for having made me fear a crime, which may as easily be committed against yourself.—Go.
                                         [Exit Alba. (King walks up and down the chamber several times, in order to collect himself.) Enter Domingo . Dom. (After having long surveyed him.) How agreeably am I surprised in finding your Majesty so calm—
King. Surprised!
Dom. Heaven be praised, that my fears were groundless!
King. Fears! What had you to fear!
Dom. I dare not conceal from your Majesty that I am acquainted with a secret—
King. Did I express my wish to share it with you? You are forward enough, by my soul.
Dom. My Liege, the place where I have learnt it, and the seal under which it was communicated, free me from your reproach. It was entrusted to me at the confessional—entrusted as a crime which is a load upon the conscience of the Princess Eboli. Too late she mourns her rashness, and [200]   dreads the consequences it will produce to her Majesty.
King. Indeed!—Good creature!—I sent for you on this account. You must extricate me from the labyrinth into which my blind zeal has hurried me. From you I expect the truth. Speak openly. What am I to think—what to resolve?
Dom. My Liege, even if the station which I fill did not enjoin me to recommend gentleness and mercy, I should, nevertheless, conjure your Majesty, for the sake of your own peace, to be satisfied with what you have discovered, and not dive further into a mystery, which will only make you more unhappy. What is yet known may be forgiven. Let
[Page 87]
the King say one word, and the Queen has never deviated from her duty. Our monarch's will can bestow virtue as well as honours. His repose alone can silence the reports of calumny.
King. Reports!—Already reports among my subjects!
Dom. Lies—infernal lies, I dare be sworn. But I grant there are cases in which the opinion of the people, though without foundation, is of as much consequence as truth.
King. By heaven—and this particularly—
Dom. Unblemished reputation is the valuable property which a Queen must be eager to share with her inferiors.
King. We need not trifle thus. (Looks doubtfully at Domingo.) Father, you have something worse to mention. [225]   Withhold it not. I have almost read it in your ill-boding looks. Be it what it may let me not linger on the rack. What say my subjects?
Dom. I repeat that your subjects may be mistaken—nay that they are so. The King need not fear their bold assertions, but when they proceed to such extremities—
King. To the point, I say. Must I pray so long for poison?
Dom. Your subjects recollect the month in which your Majesty was attacked so dangerously as to be thought at the point of death. Thirty weeks after this, the birth of a Princess was announced.
(King rises, and rings the bell.) Enter Alba . Dom. (Starts.) I am astonished.
King. Alba, you are a man. Protect me against this priest.
Alba. Compose yourself, my Liege.
King. (Looks at Alba, and leaves him.) What am I doing?
[Page 88]
In to whose arms do I throw myself! To escape a crocodile I place myself under the protection of a viper!— Have I, then, no other choice?
Dom. (Who has exchanged looks of confusion with Alba.) Had we known that this intelligence would have drawn down resentment on the reporter of it—
King. A bastard, did you say? I had scarcely left the bed of sickness, when she became a mother! If my memory be correct, it was then that you directed thanksgivings [250]   to be offered up in every church for my miraculous recovery. Is this less miraculous? One might be as unexpected as the other; but it does not suit your purpose equally to call them miracles. Oh, I see through your devices. The plot will not succeed.
Alba. Plot!
Dom. What a degrading suspicion!
King. Is it probable that your opinions should so exactly correspond, if you did not understand each other? Will you attempt to convince me of this? You think, perhaps, that I have not observed your mutual eagerness to fall upon your prey—your triumph in having roused my anger? You think, perhaps, I have not noticed the Duke's attempts to keep my son far from my royal favour, and your's, Domingo, to strengthen his weak enmity with the gigantic power of Philip. I am the bow, you think, which may be bent according to your will. But, let me tell you that my will is yet my own, as you, perhaps, may soon discover.
Alba. Our fidelity little expected such an interpretation.
King. What! Fidelity warns us against threatening dangers — malice alone speaks of the past. What have I gained by all your vaunted zeal? If all you say be true, my lot can only be a painful separation, and the sad triumph of revenge. But no. You are not sure—you waver—you conjecture—you lead me to the brink of an abyss—and fly.

[Page 89]
Dom. [275]   Can any other proofs be adduced unless we had ocular demonstration?
King. (After a long pause, turns, with a solemn air, to Domingo.) I will convene all the grandees of Spain, and, in person, sit as judge of the tribunal. You shall appear—if you have courage to do it—you shall appear, and accuse the Queen of infidelity. If you convict her, she shall die—she and the Infant—but, mark me, should your charge be false, you yourself shall be the victim. Now, dare you proceed thus far in the defence of truth?—Answer. You are silent —you refuse! Such is a liar's zeal.
Alba. (Who has been standing at a distance, in a cold, but decisive tone.) I will do this.
King. (Turns suddenly round, and gazes earnestly at the Duke.) That is bold—but I remember that, in battles, you have often risked your life for less than this—that, with a gamester's levity, you have risked it for that bubble, fame. What, then, is life to you? What charms can it have to one born, as it were, in fetters? I shall not sacrific royal blood to a madman, who has no further hope than gloriously to lose his mean existence. I reject your offer.— Go, and in the hall of audience wait my further orders.
                                         [Exeunt Alba and Domingo. Now, favouring Providence, send me a man. Thou hast given me much—send me a man, worthy to be my friend. Thou canst reign alone, for thou canst dive into futurity; but I implore thee to bestow a friend, for I am not like thee omniscient. Thou knowest what those are, whom thou hast stationed near me. I want truth. Send me a man with uncorrupted [300]   principles, whose enlightened mind can aid me in the search of it. Among the thousands who bask in the sunshine of my dignity, let me at least find one deserving of my firm regard. (Takes a large book from a cabinet, and turns over the leaves of it.) Nothing is written here but
[Page 90]
names—merely names. Even the service is not mentioned which entitled them to a place in this list, and what is more forgetful than gratitude? But, in the other list, I find each crime is noted. This is not well. Does memory require this aid, lest revenge should be forgotten! (Reads.) Count Egmont! Why is his name here? The victory at Saint Quentin his other actions banish from my mind. I consign him to the dead. (Erases his name, and adds it to the other list—then again reads.) Marquis Posa. Posa! I scarcely recollect this man——and yet his name is doubly marked, a proof that I designed to employ him upon some important matter. How happens it that such a man should have avoided the presence of his royal debtor? By heavens, it would seem he is the only man in my dominions who needs not my assistance. If he were swayed by avarice, or ambition, he would long ago have found his way to the steps of my throne. I will enquire after this singular character. He, who makes no application for favours, will be the more ready to avow the truth.
                                         [Exit. Scene Scene , the Hall of Audience. Carlos is discovered in conversation with the Prince of Parma. Alba, Feria, Medina, Lerma , and other Grandees , with papers in their hands, are awaiting the arrival of the King . Med. (Evidently avoided by all the Grandees, turns to Alba, who is lost in meditation.) You, Duke, have seen [325]   his Majesty. How was he disposed?
Alba. Very ill disposed towards you and your intelligence.
Med. I was more composed, more happy, when assailed by the slaughtering cannon of the English, than at present. (Carlos, who has gazed at him with silent sympathy, approaches and takes his hand.) Generous Prince, accept my
[Page 91]
warmest thanks. You see how all avoid me. You see that my destruction is inevitable.
Car. Hope the best, my worthy friend. Rely upon my father's mercy and your innocence.
Med. I have lost a fleet such as had never yet appeared upon the ocean. Compared to this what is my head?— But, Prince—I have five sons—hopeful as yourself.—When I think of them, my heartstrings almost crack.
Enter King , dressed. All instantly bow, make way, and form a semicircle round him. King. (Casting a hasty glance through the assembly.) Be covered. (Carlos and Parma approach and kiss the King's hand. He turns with rather a friendly air to the latter, without appearing to observe his son.) Nephew, your mother wishes to know how you are liked at Madrid.
Par. Let her not ask that till I have served my first campaign.
King. Be patient. Your turn will come when these firm props of my throne grow weak. (To Ferdinand.) What tidings do you bring?
Fer. (Kneels.) The grand master of the Calatravian order died this morning. I render to your Majesty his cross.
King. (Takes it, and looks round.) Who after him is most worthy to wear it? (Beckons to Alba, who approaches, and kneels.) [350]   Duke, I bestow this honour upon you, my first general. Never attempt to be more , and you will never lose my royal favour. (Espies Medina.) Ha!—My admiral!
Med. (Approaches, and kneels with downcast head.) This , mighty monarch, is all that I bring back of the Armada and the Spanish youth.
King. (After a pause.) God's will be done. I sent you to contend against man, not against the elements. You are welcome to Madrid, (Presents his hand to Medina,) and I
[Page 92]
thank you for having in yourself preserved one of my worthy servants. I acknowledge him as such, grandees, and expect that you will do the same. (Beckons to him that he may arise and be covered—then turns to Carlos and Parma.) I thank you for your presence, Princes.
                                         [Exeunt Carlos and Parma. (The other Grandees approach, kneel, and present their papers, which the King carelessly looks at, and gives to Alba.) Lay these before me in my cabinet. Any thing more? (No one answers.) How happens it that, among my grandees, the Marquis Posa never shews himself? I know he has served me with great honour to himself. Is he alive?
Ler. Yes, my liege. He lately returned from the tour of Europe, is in Madrid at present, and only waits for a court day to throw himself at the feet of your Majesty.
Alba. The Marquis Posa! True. That is the knight of Malta, whom Fame, as your Majesty has heard, reports to be a prodigy of valour. When, by the command of the grand master, the knights were summoned to defend the island from Solyman's attack, this youth, then eighteen [375]   years of age, quitted the royal college, and appeared unexpectedly before La Valette. “The cross which I wear,” said he, “was bought—I will prove that I deserve it.” He was one of those forty knights, who, at noon-day, defended the castle of Saint Elmo against Piali, Ulucciali, Mustapha, and Hassem, though they attacked it thrice; and, when they at last prevailed, when all the other knights had fallen round him, he plunged into the sea, and found his way to La Valette. Two months after this, the enemy forsook the island, and the knight returned to finish his studies.
Fer. This Marquis Posa, too, was he, who afterwards discovered the conspiracy in Catalonia, and, by skill alone, preserved that valuable province.

[Page 93]
Ler. The self-same man, soon after this, became, by his father's death, a grandee, and the possessor of a million; yet, with unexampled diffidence, even in the spring of life and fame, he has not courted power, but lives retired, even in Madrid, and has escaped his Monarch's favour, only because his modest merits have made him a stranger to our court.
King. I am astonished. What man's actions were ever thus described by three, and by all without envy? This man possesses a most uncommon character, or none.—I must see him. (To Alba.) After I have been at mass, bring [400]   him to my cabinet.                                          [Exit Alba. Duke Feria, take my place in the privy council.
                                         [Exit. Fer. His Majesty is very gracious to-day.
Med. Say rather he is a God. To me he has been one.
Fer. How well do you deserve his favour! I congratulate you most sincerely, Admiral.
A Grandee. And I.
Another. And I most cordially.
A third. My heart beats with delight.
First Grandee. The King was not gracious—he was merely just.
Ler. (Apart to Medina, as they go.) How great two or three royal words have made you!
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene , the King's cabinet. Enter Posa and Alba . Posa. Me!—Surely you are mistaken. What can he want with me
Alba. All I can tell you is, that he wishes to be better acquainted with you.
Posa. I can be of no service to him—am beneath his notice. You are to blame—you should have mentioned this.
Alba. I to blame How could I know why he thus summoned you?

[Page 94]
Posa. If it be merely to satisfy curiosity, the time is lost when thus employed, and, alas, life is but short.
Alba. You know not how to use a propitious moment. Thousands would envy your present situation.
Posa. [425]   I am sorry for it. I see nothing very particular in this room—I see no good end in my ever having entered it. Of what consequence can I be to the King?
Alba. This is, I must own, the language of a philosopher. (Going.)
Posa. Whither so fast?
Alba. I go to announce you.
Posa. You need not be in such haste. Tell me, how long will the audience be?
Alba. That depends upon his Majesty's pleasure.
Posa. I must submit—but I shall not please his Majesty.
Alba. If you do not wish it you will not. I leave you to your destiny. The King is in your hands. Avail yourself of this auspicious moment; but if it be lost, ascribe the failure to yourself.
                                         [Exit. Posa. The remark is good, Duke Alba. Of the moment which is only once offered I should avail myself. This courtier teaches me an useful lesson—useful as I apply the term, though not as he would. (Walks to and fro.) But what brought me hither?—The mere caprice of accident. My name, the most unlikely name on earth, has awakened in the memory of the King.—Accident, therefore——yet perhaps more—for what is accident but the rough stone, which acquires life by the statuary's chissel?—Providence bestows the accidental moment, which man must use to his purpose. What the King's business is with me I know not, [450]   but what mine is with the King I know full well.—Could I but even throw one spark of truth into the despot's soul, how fruitful might it be if Providence assisted it! In this light, what first appeared the effect of chance, may be the act of heaven. Whether such is the case or not, I will conceive
[Page 95]
myself the instrument of a higher power, and act accordingly. (Walks across the apartment, and at length calmly looks at a picture. The King appears in an adjoining room, where he delivers some orders, then steps forward, and surveys Posa for some moments unperceived. The Marquis at length espies him, instantly kneels, then rises, and stands before him without the smallest sign of embarrassment.)
King. (Gazes at him with astonishment.) Did you speak to me?
Posa. No.
King. (After another pause.) Your services have been most essential to me. Why have you avoided my thanks? Many men force themselves upon my recollection, and I cannot think of every one. You ought to have appeared. Why did you not?
Posa. My Liege, no more than two days have elapsed since I returned to Spain.
King. I am not disposed to be in debt to a subject. Demand some boon.
Posa. I enjoy the laws.
King. That does a murderer also.
Posa. But how much more, an honest citizen. My Liege I am quite satisfied.
King. (Aside.) Bold and spirited by heaven, but that might be expected, for what but this could have availed against the Turks? I like my Spaniards to be proud; nay, [475]   I would sometimes have the goblet overflow.—— (Aloud.) I am told you left my service.
Posa. I withdrew to make room for men who were more capable.
King. I am sorry to hear it. When men like you retire, my state must suffer much. Perhaps you are afraid you may not gain a post equal to your merits?
Posa. Oh, no. I am sure that an experienced statesman will at once distinguish those who will suit his purpose.
[Page 96]
With humble gratitude I feel the favour which your Majesty confers upon me by your good opinion, but—
King. Why do you pause?
Posa. I own that I am not prepared to clothe, in the language of a subject, the ideas I had formed as a citizen of the world; for when I renounced all hopes of any favour from the crown, I thought myself released from the necessity of preparing for the explanation which your Majesty requires.
King. Is your explanation founded upon arguments so weak that you dare not produce them?
Posa. Not so. If your Majesty will allow me to complete my explanation, I will pledge my life for its validity and force; but if you refuse me this, the only choice I have left is between your displeasure and contempt, in which case I will rather appear to you a criminal than a fool.
King. Proceed.
Posa. [500]   I can serve no Prince.
King. Because you fear thereby to be a slave?
Posa. No, my Liege—that I shall never fear; but I do not wish to make the monarch, whom I serve, my equal. (The King gazes at him with astonishment.) I will not deceive my employer. Were you to claim my services, you would merely think you used my arm in the field, my talents in the cabinet. You would think that all my services appertained to the throne. The glory of my deeds, the beauty of my works, the inward rapture arising from the merit of invention, would flow into the royal treasure, which, in return, would pay me, and support me like a mere machine. My deeds themselves must be no object to me, except as they are sanctioned by the King. But to me virtue has its own intrinsic value. Of the happiness which my sovereign might dispense through my hands, I should conceive myself the dispenser. That would be choice and pleasure to me which should only be duty. I should revel in the transporting thought of diffusing happiness, till satiated with the delightful idea, I
[Page 97]
should even disregard my monarch's favour. Is this your opinion? Can you in your creation brook a new creator? No.—Can I demean myself to be the pencil when I may be the artist? No.——I love human nature, and, under regal government, every one must love himself alone.
King. Your warmth is praiseworthy. You wish to do [525]   good. To the patriot and the philosopher it is immaterial how this is done. Chuse that office in my kingdom which you think best adapted to gratify your propensity.
Posa. I know no office which would suit me.
King. How!
Posa. Is the happiness which your Majesty would dispense through my hand the same happiness which my own pure philanthropy would bestow? No. The policy of courts has excited its own desires in the mind of man, to gratify which it must dispense its own happiness. It allows no truth but such as suits its purpose—all else is rejected. Can then a King, with such restrictions, make man happy? Can I prevail upon myself to love my fellow-creatures no longer, to enslave my brother, to deny that he shall think, and then convince myself that I am dispensing happiness? Oh never, never! Fix not on me, my Liege, to act in such a way. I cannot serve a Prince.
King. (Steps back with astonishment.) Whence comes this man? (Looks doubtfully at him for some time.) And with this play of words, this artful sophistry, you think you can evade the duty which you owe the state?
Posa. The state to which I was indebted, is no more. Formerly there was a King, because the laws appointed him—now there are laws appointed by the King. What I then gave to my equal, I am not now compelled to give my Monarch— [550]   and as for native land, I have none. A Spaniard has no longer any concern with Spain, since it is become merely the body of a single mind. In this vast body you wish, alone,
[Page 98]
to think, to act, and to enjoy the luxuries of life. Man is of use to you like your ears and eyes. You survey him in no other light than as he answers your purposes. His life, his will, are no longer his own. Genius and virtue blossom for the throne, as the crops grow yellow for the reaper's sickle. I no longer know the human race. A crowned mortal has devised a wondrous plan, by which the passions and the thoughts of all are governed. Policy prompted him to invent one scale, by which the opinions of all mankind are measured.
King. (Somewhat hastily.) Are you a protestant?
Posa. Your faith, my Liege, is mine. (After a pause.) Your Majesty does not understand me. I feared it would be so. You see the veil drawn by my hand from the mysteries of royalty. You think that nothing can be sacred to me which I do not fear, and suppose me dangerous because I have raised my thoughts above my condition. But this is not the case. Never can my blood be heated with the turbulent love of innovation, which only increases the weight of those fetters it is unable to break. The times adapted to my ideas are not yet arrived. I live a citizen of those which are to come.
King. Am I the first person to whom you have avowed [575]   these sentiments?
Posa. These sentiments!—You are.
King. Then should you have well considered whether it was not dangerous to avow them?—Are you sufficiently acquainted with me?
Posa. Whether it was dangerous or not I am now to learn, my Liege; but it was my duty to suppose that you, at least, possessed the smaller merit when I boldly aimed at a greater —the merit of listening to those truths which I dare utter.
King. (Rises, and walks aside.) This language is new to me. The incense of servility and adulation must, at last, exhaust itself. Imitation debases a man of talents.—I will
[Page 99]
try this independent counsellor. (Aloud.) If such be your sentiments, I am resolved to employ your services. The strength of mind—
Posa. How mean, my Liege, must be your opinion of human nature, that you so little expected to hear any one step forth in defence of its dignity,—nay, that even in the language of an independent man you fancy you perceive the arts of a dissembling flatterer!—But you are justified in this, for you have been compelled by mankind to adopt such sentiments. They have voluntarily forfeited their rights, and descended to their present abject state. Alarmed at the shadow of your greatness, they have fled from their posts, sunk into poverty, adorned their chains with the sophistry of cowards, [600]   and deem it a virtue to wear them with submission. Thus did you overcome the world—thus did it yield its rights to your imperial father. Thus mournfully is human nature degraded—how, then, could you respect it?
King. I perceive some truth in your remarks.
Posa. But, unfortunately, when you transformed the work of the Creator into the work of your own hands, and made yourself this new-formed being's God—then you omitted something—you yourself remained no more than a created man; you continued to feel all the passions and desires of human nature. What could your subjects do? You wanted sympathy; but to a Deity we can only sacrifice and pray— to sympathize with him who dares attempt?—At the pinnacle of greatness, therefore, you were not happy, for real happiness can only be felt when it beams in the eye of a friend, not of a slave. Slaves can never be faithful mirrors, but rather resemble thirsty plants, which, by their varied foliage, shew what their roots imbibed. Unhappy exchange. Sad degradation of human nature. Since man became your instrument, what harmony have you produced?
King. (Aside.) By heaven his words pierce to my very soul.

[Page 100]
Posa. Thus have you purchased divinity, and well is it for you that you have obtained this; for how dreadful were it, if, after trampling on the happiness of millions, and destroying all the joys of your own existence, you had gained [625]   nothing—how dreadful if you had gained less than the freedom of these millions would have produced, these millions, whom you have reduced to poverty, in order to make yourself still poorer than they—how dreadful if you had found that the liberty which you have annihilated, was the only foundation on which you could have established what you wish!———I beg your permission to retire, my Liege. This subject hurries me away. My heart is full——
Lerma enters, and whispers a few words in the King's ear, who gives him a signal to retire, which he obeys. King. Finish your observations.
Posa. The generous lion suffers the insect to play about its mane. With gratitude I acknowledge—
King. You have more to say. Proceed.
Posa. My Liege, I lately arrived from Brabant. “What rich and blooming provinces are these,” thought I. “What a great and powerful nation—and a good nation too! How glorious to be its father!” While these reflections occupied my mind, I stumbled against—human bones. (Pauses, and rivets his eye on the King, who endeavours to look at him in return, but cannot.) When surrounded by flames, or branded with the glowing iron, the martyr cannot be expected to sing the praises of his executioner. It is said you must act thus; but I have been astonished that you can. The reign of Philip will be recorded in history. A milder age will succeed it, and produce milder opinions. The happiness of the subject will then be compatible with the greatness of the Prince, and humanity will be a substitute [650]   for what is now called necessity.

[Page 101]
King. Had I feared the curses of the present age, when would that milder one described by you have appeared?— Examine Spain. Uninterrupted happiness pervades it, and the same tranquillity will I bestow on Flanders.
Posa. The tranquillity of the tomb! Can you hope to succeed in your attempt? Can you expect to overpower the convictions of reason and reflection? Will you alone oppose yourself to destiny, and, with a mortal's hand, try to detain her constantly-revolving wheel? Surely, surely, no. With enthusiasm irresistible will the gigantic power of oppression be subdued. Already have thousands fled from your kingdom; and, though poor, have rejoiced in their escape.— Those whom religion has induced to emigrate, were the most valuable of your subjects. With the open arms of a mother Elizabeth receives the fugitives, and Britain flourishes by Spanish arts. Grenada mourns the deprivation of her industrious Christians, and triumphant Europe sees her enemy's blood flow from the wounds inflicted by himself. (Posa perceives that the King is somewhat moved, and approaches nearer.) It is your wish to plant for eternity, and you are sowing death. It is in vain that you have wasted a valuable life, and sacrificed so many royal virtues, to chimerical pursuits, founded upon cruelty. You have erred in your opinion of man—he is far more than you esteem him to be.— With a smile of proud contempt, he will one day walk over [675]   the ruins of that building which you had destined to be his sepulchre,—with the names of Nero and Busiris he will join yours, and——this hurts me—for you once were good.
King. Who made you so sure of that?
Posa. Yes, by the Almighty, I know it well. Restore to us what you have taken away. Make us happy as we were. Become the monarch of a million monarchs. (Boldly approaches, seizes the King's hand, and gazes at him with firmness and ardour.) Oh that the eloquence of all whose happiness depends on this important hour were granted to me,
[Page 102]
that I might raise into a flame the spark which glistens in your eye. Renounce the unnatural idolatry which degrades us, and become a representative of the all-just and all-merciful. Never, never had man so much power to dispense happiness. All the potentates of Europe do homage to the name of Spain. Shew yourself worthy, then, of being their head. By writing one word, you can make the earth wear another appearance. Grant to all your subjects— (Falls at his feet.) the liberty of thought.
King. (Turns away with astonishment.) Unaccountable enthusiast!—But—rise—I—
Posa. (Still kneeling.) Behold the beauties of nature which surround you. Those beauties are the effects of freedom. Compared to this creation, how wretched and confined is yours. When a leaf moves, the lord of Christendom is alarmed,—every virtue makes him tremble. But our [700]   Almighty Ruler, that he may not rob us of the sweet delights which liberty imparts, suffers even vice to revel in his world, conceals himself from our view, but leaves his mild benignant laws, by which it is his will that we should regulate our conduct.
King. And would you undertake to establish such a system in my dominions?
Posa. This may be done by you. Devote that power which has been, alas, too long otherwise employed, to the promotion of your people's happiness. Restore to mankind the dignity they have lost. Let every citizen enjoy his former privileges. Let the peasant eat the produce of his labour at his unmolested home. Let every one's thoughts be free as the air which he breathes. When you have established this, my Liege, when man again begins to feel his consequence, when each citizen again assumes his national importance, then will your Majesty feel that your kingdom is the happiest on earth, and, in order to complete the godlike plan, it will then be your duty to conquer the whole world.

[Page 103]
King. (After a long pause.) I have allowed you to conclude. Your opinions are, I perceive, not like those of any other person, and I do not choose that they shall be restrained by authority. To me, of all mankind, you have opened the inmost recesses of your mind. I feel it, and, in consequence of your having, till to-day, buried in your own breast opinions [725]   so warmly adopted—in consequence of this praiseworthy discretion, I will forget, young man, that you avowed such sentiments. Rise. As an experienced friend, not as a monarch, I will judge of your unguarded conduct. Even into well-disposed minds, I perceive the infection of heresy can enter, though it appears with less odious symptoms— but avoid my inquisition, for I should be sorry—
Posa. (Interrupts him with ardour.) Should you indeed?
King. (Lost in the contemplation of his mien and words.) Never, in my life, did I see such a man!——No, Marquis, your accusation is too strong. I will not be a Nero— especially towards you. Every one's happiness shall not be destroyed by me.—To convince you that your charges are not just, you yourself shall, under my own protection, be allowed to act like a man.
Posa. (With ardour.) And what is to be the lot of my fellow-subjects? Oh, I did not mean to plead my cause, but their's. Direct your favours towards Brabant. In Flanders there are thousands more worthy of them than I am.
King. (In a milder, but solemn tone.) No more, young man. When you have reached my age, your opinion of mankind will more resemble mine. But I would not willingly remove you from me. Tell me how I can bind you to my interest. For the first time I perceive that my dignity is of no avail.
Posa. My Liege, your intentions are to me of greater value [750]   than any thing which royalty can grant. Allow me to
[Page 104]
remain in my present situation, for how should I justify my character if I would accept a bribe?
King. I will not submit to this pride. From to-day you are in my service. Make no reply. It is my will. (After a pause.) It seems you have discovered my situation as a king —has not your penetration dived into my domestic concerns? (Perceiving that Posa appears to be meditating.) I understand you—but—though I may be the most unfortunate of fathers, may I not be happy as a husband?
Posa. If a most hopeful son, and the possession of a most amiable consort, can give a mortal any right to the epithet of happy, your Majesty is so in both respects.
King. (With a gloomy mien.) No,—I am not, and never felt that I was not, so keenly as at present. (Dwelling with a look of sorrow on Posa.) How happy had your father been if he could have left his son a kingdom! (Posa turns away and wipes his eyes.) For so many crowns—no thanks—no gratitude.
Posa. The Prince's ideas are noble. I never found them otherwise.
King. But I have.——You are acquainted with him, then?
Posa. Yes.—We were at college together.
King. He was never dutiful; but, on the contrary, has [775]   made me the object of his ridicule. He has a bad heart.
Posa. May I be allowed to say in his behalf—
King. (In a commanding tone.) No—you may not, unless you mean to forfeit my regard for ever. No diadem can be a recompence for that of which he has deprived me—a virtuous Queen.
Posa. Who can have dared, my Liege—
King. The world—fame—scandal—I myself. Here lie proofs of her guilt—more are at hand, which make me dread the worst. But, Marquis, one thing staggers me. Who is her accuser?—Eboli. Is it not more probable that the one
[Page 105]
is guilty of slander, than the other of—incest? Does not Domingo hate my son and her? Is not Duke Alba brooding vengeance?——My wife is worth more than all of them.
Posa. Right, my Liege. There is something in that woman's soul, which is above appearances and scandal—its name is virtue.
King. You are right. Oh Marquis, you have studied the nature of mankind. Long have I wished for such a friend. Yes. To sink so low as I am told the Queen is fallen, costs too much. The ties of honour are not rent asunder so easily as it is wished I should believe. The blood that flows through royal veins despises that seducing poison which burns within the hearts of slaves. You are the man whom I so long have [800]   wanted. You know the frailties and imperfections of human nature. I have therefore fixed on you—
Posa. (Surprised and alarmed.) On me, my Liege!
King. You have stood thus long in my presence without making a request. This is new to me. You will be just. Passion will not lead you astray. Force yourself into the confidence of the Prince. Dive into the Queen's sentiments. I myself will send you full powers to be admitted into her presence. Meanwhile, you are one of my chamberlains— and now leave me. (Rings a bell.)
Posa. May I leave you with the conviction that any of my wishes are gratified?—Then is this day the most glorious of my life.
King. (Presents his hand.) It is not lost in mine.—Farewell. Let it not be long before I again see you.
As the Marquis is going, Enter Lerma . King. (To Lerma.) In future admit the Knight of Malta unannounced.
                                         [Exeunt.

END OF ACT III.

[Page 106]
ACT IV. Scene Scene , one of the Queen's Apartments. Queen, Olivarez, Eboli, Fuentes , and other Ladies are discovered. Queen. (Rising from her seat.) The key has not been found, you say. Let the lock be forced, then—and immediately. (Espies Eboli, who approaches and kisses her hand.) Welcome, dear Princess. I am glad to see you so much recovered, though you still look pale.
Fue. (Somewhat maliciously.) The consequences of a nervous fever.—Am I not right, Princess?
Queen. I much wished to have visited you, dear Eboli, but it is not allowed.
Oli. The Princess has not been in want of society.
Queen. That I can easily believe.—What means this? You tremble—
Ebo. Nothing—nothing whatever. I beg you Majesty's permission to withdraw.
Queen. You conceal your indisposition, and are not so well as you wish us to suppose. Countess, draw the sofa nearer.
Ebo. The open air will be of more service to me.
                                         [Exit. Queen. Follow her, Countess. What a sudden change!
                                         [Exit Fuentes. Enter a Page, who whispers in the ear of Olivarez . Oli. The Marquis Posa begs permission to wait upon your Majesty. (Queen starts.) He comes from the King.
Queen. Admit him.
                                         [Page opens the door, and Exit.
[Page 107]
Enter Posa . Queen. (Gives Posa, who kneels, a signal to rise.) What are his Majesty's commands? May I thus openly—
Posa. My message is for your private ear.
                                         [Exeunt Olivarez and Ladies. Queen. [25]   May I believe my eyes! Marquis? You deputed by the King—
Posa. Does that seem so strange to your Majesty? To me it is quite otherwise.
Queen. The world is quite altered, then, I must confess.
Posa. True, and the present period teems with new wonders.
Queen. Scarcely with greater.
Posa. Suppose that I am converted—that I am weary of acting a singular part at Philip's court——for of what use is singularity? To be useful, I must endeavour to appear the equal of others, and banish the ostentatious appearance of enthusiasm. Suppose—for every one wishes to extend, as far as he can, principles which he is convinced to be right— suppose I aimed at placing mine upon the throne.
Queen. No, Marquis. Even in jest I would not fancy you capable of adopting an idea in every respect so premature. You are not so romantic as to begin a project which can never be completed.
Posa. There rests the doubt, methinks.
Queen. The utmost which I can suspect—and much it would surprise me in you—the utmost I can suspect is—
Posa. Dissimulation. That is possible.
Queen. The king cannot intend that you should say to me what you will.
Posa. [50]   True.
Queen. And can the goodness of your cause justify the culpable means you have employed? Can your noble pride descend to such an office? Scarcely can I believe it.

[Page 108]
Posa. Nor I, if the object were merely to deceive the King. But that is not the case. I intend to serve him more honestly, and to better effect, than if I had exactly followed his instructions.
Queen. Now I recognise the Marquis Posa. Proceed.
Posa. It is his Majesty's wish that you would not give an audience to the French ambassador to-day. This was the commission with which I was entrusted.
Queen. And is this all you have to say from him?
Posa. It is nearly all which justifies my presence here.
Queen. I did not mean to dive into secrets which it is thought proper to conceal from me.
Posa. Some there are which answer this description. I could warn you against dangers—against certain persons— but I will rather leave you in ignorance: for all I know is not of consequence enough to banish golden sleep from the eyes of an angel. It was, indeed, not this which brought me hither. Don Carlos—
Queen. How did you leave him?
Posa. Like a philosopher, ready to die for the object of his affections.—I have not much to say—but there is himself. (Delivers a letter.)
Queen. (After having perused it.) [75]   He says he must see me.
Posa. That say I too.
Queen. Can it make him happy to be a witness of my sorrows?
Posa. No, but it can make him more active and more resolute.
Queen. How?
Posa. Duke Alba is about to depart for Flanders.
Queen. I heard he was appointed, but—
Posa. The King never revokes his appointments. He is immoveable as Nature's laws. But the Prince must, nevertheless,
[Page 109]
remain here no longer, and Flanders must not be sacrificed.
Queen. Can you prevent that?
Posa. Perhaps I can; though the remedy is almost as bad as the danger which is to be counteracted. It is the rashness of despair; but I know no other means.
Queen. Name it.
Posa. To you, and you alone, I dare disclose it: and from your lips alone can Carlos hear it without shuddering. The name it bears is harsh, I own—
Queen. Rebellion!
Posa. He shall, in contradiction to his father's will, privately go to Flanders, where he will be received with open arms. Justice will be strong, when supported by a monarch's [100]   son. Let his arms make the Spanish throne totter, and his father will grant him in Brussels what he denied in Madrid.
Queen. Will he indeed? Are you so sure of that?
Posa. Why not? What is Philip's force, when opposed to that of the united Netherlands? Carlos will offer submission; and humility, at the head of an army, can do wonders. The King will be left to decide between a generous pardon or a doubtful contest; and the very man, who to-day refused his petition, will then forgive his crime.
Queen. Can you, who have seen him to-day, expect this?
Posa. That is my very reason for expecting it.
Queen. (After a pause.) Your plan alarms, yet at the same time pleases me. I believe you are right. The idea is a bold one, and, on that account, charms me. Is the Prince acquainted with it?
Posa. I wished him to hear it from your lips rather than from mine.
Queen. Doubtless the idea is an exalted one, if the Prince's youth—
Posa Name not that. He will there find the intrepid warriors
[Page 110]
of the imperial Charles—Egmont and Orange, wise in the cabinet as dreadful in the field.
Queen. You are right, you are right. The Prince must be active. The part which he acts in Madrid oppresses me [125]   more than himself. The aid of France and Savoy I can promise. Marquis, I am of your opinion, but this plan requires the aid of money.
Posa. That is at hand.
Queen. And I too have resources.
Posa. I may give him hopes of seeing you, then?
Queen. But how can this be effected?
Posa. If natural means fail, we must have recourse to extraordinary aid.
Queen. I know of none.
Posa. What think you of the subterraneous passages?
Queen. Impossible! The King is in possession of the keys.
Posa. Even if that be the case, may we not—
Queen. I will give it some consideration.
Posa. Carlos anxiously awaits your Majesty's reply, and I promised I would not return without it. (Presents his tablets to the Queen.) Two lines will, at present, be sufficient to rouse his expectations.
Queen. (After having written.) Shall I see you again soon?
Posa. As often as you command me to attend.
Queen. As often as I command you to attend! Marquis, how am I to interpret this liberty?
Posa. In the most innocent way you can. Be assured I [150]   have a glorious end in view.
Queen. Glorious indeed! Oh Marquis, how should I rejoice if Europe were to regain her freedom—and through Aim! You may rely upon my secret sympathy.
Posa. Thanks, thanks! I was sure I should be understood.

[Page 111]
Olivarez appears at the door. Queen. (With distance to Posa.) The King's wishes are my law. Present my most respectful duty to his Majesty.
                                         [Exeunt severally. Scene Scene , a Gallery. Enter Carlos and Lerma . Car. Here we shall not be interrupted. What have you to tell me?
Ler. Your Highness had a friend at this court.
Car. (Starts.) It is more than I knew.
Ler. I must beg pardon, then, for having learnt more than I ought; but, that your Highness may be at ease, I can assure you I had it from authority on which you may rely, for I myself discovered it.
Car. To whom do you allude?
Ler. To the Marquis Posa.
Car. Well?
Ler. If he be acquainted with more of your affairs than every one may know, which I almost fear—
Car. Fear!
Ler. He has had an audience of the King.
Car. Indeed!
Ler. Which was of a most secret nature, and of two hours duration. It was, I am sure, of material importance.
Car. [175]   That I believe.
Ler. I heard your name mentioned several times.
Car. That is no bad sign, I hope.
Ler. Some very strange allusions were also made to the Queen, in his Majesty's room, this morning.
Car. (Steps back, alarmed.) Count Lerma!
Ler. When the Marquis departed, I received orders to admit him in future unannounced.
Car. That is extraordinary indeed.

[Page 112]
Ler. It is without a precedent since I have served his Majesty.
Car. Extraordinary indeed! And what were the allusions to the Queen which were made?
Ler. (Draws back.) Your Highness must excuse me. It is against my duty to repeat them.
Car. How strange, to mention one part and conceal another!
Ler. The former was my duty to you—the latter to his Majesty.
Car. You are right.
Ler. I own I have always thought the Marquis a man of strict integrity and honour.
Car. You have formed a very just opinion of him.
Ler. Every virtue is spotless till put to the test.
Car. And some even after that.
Ler. A monarch's favour is a tempting bait, which has caught many a man of rigid principle.
Car. [200]   Undoubtedly.
Ler. It is indeed often politic to discover what can no longer be concealed.
Car. Politic it is, but you mentioned that you had known the Marquis only as a man of honour.
Ler. If he be still so, my doubts cannot have made him worse, and your Highness is a double gainer.
                                         [Going. Car. (Follows him, and with emotion takes his hand.) I am a treble gainer, worthy, upright man. I feel that I possess another friend, without having lost the one I before possessed.
                                         [Exit Lerma. Enter Posa . Posa. Carlos! Carlos!
Car. Who calls? Ha! You! Just as I wished. I hasten to the convent. Follow me as soon as possible.
Posa. Stay—if but for two minutes.

[Page 113]
Car. Should we be seen together—
Posa. We shall not. I can say every thing in a moment. The Queen—
Car. You have had an audience of my father.
Posa. I have. He sent for me.
Car. (Full of expectation.) Well?
Posa. I have adjusted every thing. You will see her.
Car. And the King—what does he want?
Posa. He was merely curious to know who I was. I suppose some officious friend had mentioned me. He offered [225]   me employment—
Car. Which you refused.
Posa. Of course.
Car. And how did you part?
Posa. On tolerable terms.
Car. I was not the subject of your conversation, I suppose?
Posa. You! Yes. You were mentioned in general terms. (Draws forth his tablets.) There are a few words from the Queen. I shall learn the how, when, and where to-morrow.
Car. (Reads in great confusion, puts the tablets into his pocket, and is going.) We shall meet at the convent, then?
Posa. Hold! Why in such haste? No one is coming.
Car. (With an assumed smile.) We seem to have changed situations. You feel vastly secure to-day.
Posa. To-day! Why not to-day?
Car. And what has the Queen written.
Posa. Have you not this moment read—
Car. I!——True, true.
Posa. What means this!
Car. (Again looks at the tablets, and is in ecstacy.) Thou sweet angel! Yes. I will become worthy of thee. Love makes noble souls still nobler. Be what it may, I am ready to attempt it. She writes that I must prepare myself for an
[Page 114]
enterprize of great importance. What can she mean? Do you not know?
Posa. Even if I do, Carlos, are you composed enough to [250]   hear it?
Car. Have I offended you? Forgive me, Roderigo. I was agitated.
Posa. Agitated! By what?
Car. By—I know not what. These tablets I may keep then?
Posa. Not exactly. I, on the contrary, am come to beg that you will give me your's—
Car. Mine! Why?
Posa. As well as any other trifle, which might fall into the hands of a third—any letters—memorandums—in short, your whole pocket-book.
Car. But why?
Posa. That we may be prepared against all events. Who can be sure that you may not be surprised? On the contrary, no one will think that I am in possession of your papers. Give me them.
Car. (Much agitated.) This is very strange. Why all at once this—
Posa. Be at ease. I meant not to imply that there is any present danger, but merely wish to guard against what may occur. It was not my intention to alarm you thus. There is no cause for alarm.
Car. (Presents his pocket-book.) Take good care of it.
Posa. That I will.
Car. (With a significant look.) [275]   Roderigo, I commit much to your charge.
Posa. Not so much as I before possessed. At the convent then we meet. Till then farewel.
                                         [Going. Car. (Contends with his own feelings, and at last detains him.) Return the papers to me. There is one among them, which was written to me when I was so ill at Alkala. I have
[Page 115]
constantly treasured it near to my heart, and cannot part with it. Return that, and keep all the rest. (Takes it out, and returns the Pocket-book.)
Posa. Carlos, I do not part with that letter willingly. It is the very one I most wished to have.
Car. Farewel. (Goes slowly towards the door—stops— and suddenly returns.) There take it. (With a trembling hand he presents the letter—tears gush from his eyes—he falls on Posa's neck.) This my father could not have done. No, Roderigo. This he could not have done.
                                         [Exit instantly. Posa. (Looks after him with astonishment.) Is it possible that I did not know him thoroughly—that this fault lurked in his heart, and had escaped my notice? Suspicion of his friend's honour! How came a stain so foul upon this polished mirror? No. I am wrong. What has he done that I should accuse him of so great a weakness? Have I not often been obliged to hurt and to distress him? This was the cause—and oh I must continue to distress him. The King believed, when he entrusted his secret to my keeping, that he confided in an upright man; and such confidence demands gratitude. Why should I declare all I know when [300]   the avowal would but make my Carlos completely wretched? Why should I wake the slumberer, to shew the storm which threatens him? Better is it that I let the storm pass by, that, when he wakes, he may behold a bright, unclouded sky.
                                         [Exit. Scene Scene , the King's Cabinet. He is discovered on a sofa, and the Infanta Clara seated at his side. King. (After a long pause.) No. She is my daughter. How can nature have given her, by accident, my full blue eye. In every feature I behold myself reflected. Yes, darling of my heart—I clasp thee in my arms. Thou art my blood. (Starts.) My blood! What can I
[Page 116]
dread more? My features! Are they not also his? — (Takes up the miniature, and looks alternately at it and in the mirror, which hangs opposite to him. At length he dashes it on the floor, pushes the Infanta from him, and starts up.) Away! Away! In this abyss I am lost.
Enter Lerma . Ler. Her Majesty is just arrived in the antichamber—
King. Arrived just now!
Ler. And requests an audience.
King. At this unusual hour!—I cannot see her.
Ler. She herself approaches.
                                         [Exit. Enter Queen . (Infanta runs to her.) Queen. (Falls at the King's feet.) My lord and husband, I am under the necessity of appealing to you for justice.
King. Justice!
Queen. I am treated with indignity at your court. My cabinet has been opened by force—
King. What?
Queen. And several articles of the greatest importance to me are gone.
King. [325]   Of the greatest importance to you!
Queen. On account of the misconstruction which malicious persons, not acquainted with the circumstances—
King. Misconstruction!—Malicious persons!—But rise.
Queen. Not till you have given me your royal promise to discover and punish the offender, or have granted me permission to retire from a court, which harbours a villain and a thief.
King. Rise, I say——in this attitude——rise.
Queen. (Obeys.) That he must be of rank I am certain; for in the same cabinet were pearls and diamonds worth more than a million; but he was satisfied with letters—

[Page 117]
King. What letters?
Queen. They were from different persons—among the rest, some from the Infant, and with them was a miniature of him.
King. From——
Queen. The Infant your son.
King. To you?
Queen. Yes.
King. From the Infant! And that you say to me!
Queen. Why not, my lord?
King. With this composure?
Queen. What thus surprises you? Surely you recollect the letters which, by permission of both Monarchs, were [350]   sent by Don Carlos to me at Saint Germain. Whether the miniature which accompanied them was included in this permission, or whether he, of his own accord, ventured on the step, I take not upon me to determine; but if the latter were the case, surely his conduct was not culpable, for then he little thought he sent it to one who would ever be his mother.
King. (Almost unable to contain himself, turns aside and is going.) The viper! I knew this would be her excuse.
Queen. (Takes his hand.) What agitates you thus?
Inf. (Who has meanwhile found the miniature, brings it to the Queen.) Look, dear mother! What a pretty picture!
Queen. (Recognizes it, and stands in speechless astonishment. Both, for some time, look full at each other.) I must own, my lord, this mode of conduct is most noble, most royal—but one question more I beg leave to ask—
King. It is my place to ask questions, madam.
Queen. The innocent shall, at all events, not suffer by my suspicions. If, therefore, this theft was committed by your order—
King. It was.

[Page 118]
Queen. Then I have no longer any one to accuse or pity but yourself. The conduct of your wife will never justify you in acting thus.
King. I am accustomed to this language, madam; but, be assured I shall not be imposed upon by it as I was at Aranjuez. I am now better acquainted with the pure, innocent lady, who could defend her conduct with so much dignified majesty—
Queen. [375]   What means this?
King. Who only sent her attendants away that she might amuse herself with her child.
Queen. How am I to understand this?
King. In short, madam, is it true or false that you there conversed with some one?
Queen. True. I conversed with the Infant.
King. The Infant! It is evident, then! You confess it! Had you no more regard for my honour?
Queen. Honour, my lord! Before I was King Philip's wife, I was Henry's daughter. If any honour were concerned, a greater was at stake than Castile bestowed upon me.
King. Why did you deny what you now confess?
Queen. Because, my lord, I am not in the habit of being accused as a delinquent in the presence of a whole court. I never shall conceal the truth when it is asked with respect and propriety. But was the tone proper, which was used by your Majesty at Aranjuez? Are the assembled grandees to be considered a tribunal at which queens are to render account of their private actions? I granted the Prince an interview, because he so earnestly requested it, and because I will not allow custom to sway me in actions which I think innocent.—I concealed it from you, because I was not disposed to contend for this liberty in the presence of your [400]   Majesty's attendants and my own.
King. You use very bold language, madam.

[Page 119]
Queen. Nay, I will own another reason. I acted thus because the Infant does not possess that paternal regard which he wishes for and deserves.
King. Deserves!
Queen. Yes, deserves, my Lord. I esteem and love him as my nearest relative, who was once thought worthy of possessing my hand. I have not yet been able to discover that I ought to keep him at a greater distance than any other person, because he once was dearer to me than any other. If your state-policy can form connexions as they suit your purposes, I will prove that it cannot so easily dissolve them.— No one shall dictate to me whom I must hate or love; and, since you have compelled me to speak, I assure you that my will shall no longer be controlled. All attempts at prohibition and compulsion shall only increase my good opinion of my friends, and make me proceed even to extremities.
King. Elizabeth, you have seen me in the hours of weakness, and this recollection makes you bold. The mirror, before which we stand, makes you bold. You rely on the powers by which you have so often subdued my firmness.— But dread me the more on that account. What hitherto made me weak, may now drive me to madness.
Queen. What have I done, then, to offend you?
King. (Takes her hand.) [425]   If my suspicions be just—if the measure of your guilt be full— (Drops her hand.) I can subdue this remnant of my weakness, and will.
Queen. What have I done to offend you?
King. If I be thus wronged, blood shall atone—
Queen. Heavens! Is it come to this?
King. All Christendom shall tremble at my vengeance. I will no longer pay regard to the laws of nations, or the voice of nature—
Queen. How much I pity your Majesty—
King. (Transported beyond all bounds.) Pity!—The compassion of a harlot!

[Page 120]
Inf. (Clings affrighted to her mother.) The King is angry —and you are crying, dear mother.
King. (Pushes the child with violence from the Queen.) Go and make your complaint to your father.
Queen. (With dignified composure, but with tremulous utterance.) This child I must, at all events, protect from injury. Come with me, my daughter. (Takes the Infanta in her arms.) If the King will no longer recognize you, I must send for friends beyond the Pyrenees, who will defend us.
                                         [Going. King. (Astonished.) Queen!
Queen. I can no more—this is too much.— (Attempts to reach the door, with the child, but falls.)
King. (Hastens to her, much alarmed.) Heavens! Elizabeth!
Inf. Oh, my mother bleeds. (Runs out.)
Queen. Will no one come to help me from this room?
King. (Anxiously employed in assisting her.) What a [450]   dreadful accident! Blood!—Have I deserved that you should so severely punish me?—Rise—compose yourself— rise—I hear footsteps.—Is it your wish that the whole court should be spectators of this scene?—Must I even use supplications. (She raises herself, supported by the King.)
Enter Alba, Feria, Lerma , and Domingo . King. The Queen is indisposed. Let her be conducted to her apartments.
                                         [Exit Queen, supported by Feria and Lerma. Alba. (Who approaches with Domingo.) The Queen in tears, and blood upon her face!
King. That must, of course, surprise the demons who deceived me.
Alba and Dom. We deceive your Majesty!
King. Yes, you , who have said enough to drive me mad, though not a word towards conviction.

[Page 121]
Alba. We only repeated what we had heard.
King. Hell reward you for it! I have done what I am sorry for. She guilty! Was that the language of a guilty conscience?
Posa. (Without.) Is the King at liberty?
Enter Posa . King. (Hears his voice, and hastens to meet him.) Ha! there comes my faithful friend. Welcome Marquis! (To Alba and Domingo.) You are no longer wanted. Leave us. (Alba and Domingo look at each other with silent astonishment.)
Posa. (Much embarassed.) This defeats my hopes entirely; for I must confess that, in the business which brings me to your Majesty, I needed much Duke Alba's kind support. (Bows to the Duke.)
King. (In a stern tone, to Alba and Domingo.) You know [475]   my will. Leave us.                                          [Exeunt Alba and Domingo. Marquis, you wanted to make amends for my error. I thank you for your good intention.
Posa. My Liege, it must hurt an old man, who has faced death in twenty battles for your Majesty, to see himself thus sent away, that a youth—
King. It becomes you to think thus, and me to act as I did. He had spent more than half his life before he became as valuable to me as you already are. I do not choose to make a secret of my feelings. The marks of my royal favour conferred on you shall meet every eye. The man whom I have made my friend shall be an object of envy. What brings you hither?
Posa. Pardon me, my Liege. As I passed through the antichamber, I heard a dreadful rumour, which to me appears incredible. A violent dispute—blood—the Queen.— ——Heaven forbid that the report be true, and that your
[Page 122]
Majesty should have acted incautiously! Most important discoveries, which I have made, entirely alter the nature of the circumstances.
King. Proceed.
Posa. I have found an opportunity of obtaining the Prince's pocket-book, which will, I hope, throw some light upon— (Presents it.)
King. (Eagerly examines the contents.) A letter from the [500]   Emperor, my father—of which I never heard. (Reads it, lays it aside, and hastens to the other Papers.) Plan of a garrison —extracts from Tacitus——and what is this?—This hand I have surely seen before. It is a lady's hand. (Reads with great attention, partly aloud, partly to himself.) “This key—back part of the Queen's pavillion.”——Ha! What means this?—“Here may that love be frankly owned— flame—harvest of his hopes”——Infernal treachery! 'Tis she. It is her hand.
Posa. The Queen's! Impossible!
King. No. It is the Princess Eboli's—
Posa. Then all was true, which was reported to me by the Page who delivered the letter and the key.
King. (Grasps Posa's hand, in violent agitation.) Marquis, I perceive that I am dreadfully imposed upon. This woman—to you I will confess it, Marquis—this woman broke open the cabinet of the Queen, and her accusation was the first which I received. Who knows how far the Monk may be an accomplice? Marquis, I begin to fear I have acted hastily towards my wife.
Posa. If any secret understanding has subsisted between her Majesty and the Prince, it was certainly of a nature very different to that of which she is accused. I have certain information that the Infant's wish to go to Flanders originated with the Queen.
King. [525]   I always thought so.

[Page 123]
Posa. The Queen is ambitious. Need I say more? She is hurt to find herself disappointed in the proud hope of sharing the prerogatives which attach to royalty. The Prince's youthful ardour encouraged her projects; but, with respect to her heart, I doubt whether it can love.
King. I am not afraid of her mighty projects.
Posa. Whether she is beloved, or whether, indeed, nothing worse is to expected from the Infant—this, I own, deserves investigation. In this respect I think the greatest vigilance is necessary.
King. I employ you to exercise it.
Posa. (After some reflection.) If your Majesty thinks me capable of this undertaking, I must beg that my authority may be unlimited.
King. It shall be so.
Posa. At least that I may not, by any person whatever, be disturbed in such investigations as I think necessary.
King. You have my promise. You are my guardian angel. How much am I indebted to you for the discoveries you have made. Enter Lerma . How did you leave the Queen?
Ler. Still very weak, my Liege. (Looks doubtfully at Posa.)
King. Let her be informed that I shall come to her immediately.
                                         [Exit Lerma. Posa. (Follows him with a look of uneasiness, then turns to the King.) One precaution more appears to me necessary. [550]   I fear the Infant may have notice of our intentions. He has many friends, nay, perhaps, is connected with the rebels in Ghent. Fear may lead him to desperate resolutions. I therefore advise your Majesty to provide against this case by instant means.
King. You are right. But how—

[Page 124]
Posa. By a secret warrant of arrest, which your Majesty may confide to my care, that I may use it at the moment of danger, and—
King. (Thoughtfully.) This is a bold step. I doubt whether—
Posa. Let it remain a secret of state till—
King. (Goes to his desk, and signs the warrant.) A kingdom is at stake. Imminent danger justifies extraordinary measures.—There, Marquis! To you I need not recommend the necessary caution.
Posa. (Takes the warrant.) The case is desperate.
King. Go, dear Marquis—hasten to restore my peace of mind, and end my restless nights.
                                         [Exeunt severally. Scene Scene , the gallery. Enter Carlos , in great agitation, met by Lerma . Car. You are the man I sought.
Ler. I too sought your Highness.
Car. Is it true? For Heaven's sake, is it true?
Ler. What mean you?
Car. That he drew his dagger—that she was covered with blood when carried from his apartments. For Heaven's sake [575]   speak. How much of this is true?
Ler. She fainted, and was hurt by the fall—nothing more.
Car. Was she in no further danger—on your honour, Count?
Ler. The Queen was not—therefore are you in greater.
Car. The Queen was not! Then Heaven be praised! A dreadful rumour reached my ears, that the King was exasperated against my mother and myself, and that a secret had been discovered.
Ler. The latter may be true.
Car. True!

[Page 125]
Ler. Prince, I gave you, to-day, one warning, which you despised. Make better use of the second.
Car. How!
Ler. If I be not mistaken, some days ago I saw in your hand a pocket-book, made of blue silk and embroidered with gold.
Car. (Alarmed.) Such a one I had. Well?
Ler. On the cover was a row of pearls, I think.
Car. Right.
Ler. But a short time since, as I unexpectedly walked into the King's cabinet, I fancied that I saw this very pocket-book in his hand, and the Marquis Posa was with him.
Car. (After a pause, in a violent tone.) That is not true.
Ler. (Hurt and indignant.) [600]   Then I am a deceiver.
Car. (Looks at him for some time.) You are.
Ler. Alas! I can forgive you.
Car. (Walks to and fro in most violent agitation, and at length stops directly opposite to him.) Thine is a dreadful occupation, man. In what has he injured thee? In what has our innocent attachment injured thee, that thus thy hellish labour is employed to rend the ties of amity asunder.
Ler. Prince, I revere the pain which makes you thus unjust.
Car. Oh God, let me not be suspicious.
Ler. I remember, too, the King's own words: “How much am I indebted to you, for the discoveries you have made.” This he said as I entered.
Car. Oh, no more, no more.
Ler. Duke Alba is, I understand, disgraced, and Ruy Gomez is deprived of the great seal, which has been presented to the Marquis.
Car. (Lost in meditation.) And this he concealed from me. For what reason could he conceal it?

[Page 126]
Ler. The whole court already looks up to him as the uncontrolled minister and favourite.
Car. He loved me—loved me much. I was dear to him as his own soul. This I am sure of, for a thousand proofs have fully shewn it. But must not millions, must not his native land be dearer to him than a single friend? Yes— for a single friend his bosom was too large—my happiness [625]   too small for such a patriot's friendship. He has sacrificed me to his virtue. Can I blame him for this deed? Oh! it is certain, it is certain.—I have lost him. (Walks apart, and hides his face.)
Ler. (After a pause.) Dearest Prince, what can I do for you?
Car. (Without looking at him.) Go to the King, and also betray me. I have nothing to bestow on you.
Ler. Will you wait the consequences of—
Car. (Supports himself against a pillar.) Yes. I have lost him. Now I am completely poor.
Ler. (Approaches, with sympathizing emotion.) Prince, will you not think of providing for your safety?
Car. Safety!—Good man!
Ler. And is there no one but yourself for whom you tremble?
Car. (Starts.) Gracious God! of what do you remind me? My mother?—The letter which I returned to him— which I at first denied—yet at last gave him——— (Walks up and down in extreme agitation.) How has she deserved this treatment? Her he might at least have spared. Might he not, Lerma? (In a sudden and determined tone.) I must go to her—I must warn her of the danger.—Lerma, dear Lerma!—whom can I employ? Is there no resource?—Send the Marquis to me—immediately.
Ler. The Marquis!
Car. (In dreadful agony.) Oh Heavens!
Ler. [650]   The King, too, is with her Majesty at present.
Car. (Lost in thought.) Have I, then, not a friend in
[Page 127]
all the world——Yes, one I have.—It is impossible that my situation can be worse.
                                         [Rushes out. Ler. Prince, whither go you?
                                         [Follows him. Scene Scene , one of the Queen's apartments. Enter Eboli and Domingo , from opposite sides. Dom. Princess, have you heard the news?
Ebo. What news? You seem disordered, Chaplain.
Dom. Of our new minister.
Ebo. Is this strange report, then, true, which engrosses the conversation of the whole court?
Dom. You have an interest in it. I congratulate you, queen of a single night.
Enter Alba . Alba. (To Eboli.) Plunge my sword into my heart.— 'Twas I myself who brought him to the King.
Dom. Who could then have suspected—
Alba. So much the worse. He who could so well dissemble, who could so easily lull you and me to repose, can do still more.
Dom. “You are no longer wanted!” You remember the King's words?
Ebo. Whence has this sudden change its origin? I do not comprehend it.
Alba. (In deep meditation.) What would I now give for such a foe as the Infant has been to me.
Dom. Very true, Alba. If I understand your meaning, [675]   I could almost fancy you had dived into my mind.
Alba. In reality he is a noble Prince.
Dom. So think I.
Alba. And worthy of a better fate.
Dom. That was always my opinion.

[Page 128]
Alba. (After a pause.) Chaplain, will you join me?
Dom. In what? Do you intend—
Alba. I intend to destroy my own work, that I may again begin it on another plan.
                                         [Exit. Dom. You are silent, Princess.
Ebo. Act as you think proper. I shall never be his friend.
                                         [Exit Domingo. Enter Carlos on the opposite side. Car. (To Eboli, who starts at sight of him.) Be not alarmed, Princess. I will be gentle as a child.
Ebo. Prince, this unexpected—
Car. Are you still offended?
Ebo. Prince!
Car. Are you still offended? Tell me, I beseech you.
Ebo. What means this? You appear to have forgotten yourself, Prince. What is your business with me?
Car. (Seizes her hand.) Is your hatred eternal? Can offended love never forgive?
Ebo. (Endeavours to extricate herself.) Of what do you remind me, Prince?
Car. Of your goodness and my own ingratitude. Alas! Full well I know that I have deeply hurt you; that I have [700]   wounded your gentle heart; that I have caused tears to flow from those angelic eyes.
Ebo. Prince, leave me, I—
Car. I am come hither, because I can rely upon your mild forgiving soul.—Eboli, I have not one friend in the world except yourself. You once esteemed me. You cannot be inexorable.
Ebo. (Turns away.) No more, for Heaven's sake.
Car. Let me remind you of your kind affection, which I so basely treated. Look upon me but once in the same light as I then appeared to you, and listen to me.

[Page 129]
Ebo. Oh Carlos, how do you torment me!
Car. Be greater than you sex. Forget my offences. Do what no woman ever did before you, or will ever do again. I request of you a favour greater than you can fancy. Let me—on my knees I conjure you, let me, for a moment, see my mother.
Enter Posa , in breathless haste, with two Officers of the body guard. Posa. (Rushes between them.) What has he confessed? Believe him not.
Car. (Still on his knees, raising his voice.) By all that is sacred—
Posa. (Interrupts him in a violent tone.) He is mad. Do not attend to him.
Car. (In a louder and more earnest tone.) My life or death depend upon it. Conduct me to her.
Posa. (Draws Eboli from him by force.) [725]   You die if you listen to him. (Turns to one of the Officers.) Count Cordua, in his Majesty's name I command you to seize the Prince. (Produces the warrant of arrest. Carlos stands rooted to the spot—Eboli shrieks—the Officers are astonished. A long and solemn pause ensues. Posa is in a violent tremor, and scarcely able to suppress his feelings.) Prince, I request your sword. (To Eboli, who is going.) Princess Eboi, you will stay here. (To the Officers.) On your life allow not his Highness to say one word to any one—he must not utter a syllable even to yourself. (Whispers a few more words in the Officer's ear, then turns to the rest.) I shall immediately give account of my proceedings to the King.—You, Prince, may expect me in an hour. (Carlos allows himself to be led away, without appearing conscious of his situation; except that, as he passes, he casts a feeble
[Page 130]
dying look towards Posa, who conceals his face. No sooner is he gone, than Eboli again attempts to escape, but is seized by the Marquis.
Ebo. For Heaven's sake, let me quit this place—
Posa. (Draws her forward with terrible sternness.) Unfortunate creature, what has he said to thee?
Ebo. Nothing—release me—nothing.
Posa. (Still more sternly.) Thou shalt not go. What hast thou learnt?—Escape is impossible. Confess, for in this world thou wilt have no other opportunity.
Ebo. (Extremely alarmed.) Gracious God! What means this? You will not murder me?
Posa. (Shews a dagger.) That is my intention. Be brief.
Ebo. Oh, mercy, mercy! What have I done?
Posa. (Looks towards Heaven, and points the dagger to her breast.) As yet all is secure. As yet the poison has not dropped from the vessel which contains it. If I destroy [750]   the vessel, its contagion cannot spread. The fate of Spain depends upon a woman's life. Great Judge of all, at thy tribunal I can justify this murder. (Again raises his arm, and stands in terrible suspense.)
Ebo. (Falls at his feet, and looks boldly at him.) Now— why do you delay the blow?—I sue not for mercy. I have deserved to die—and ask for death.
Posa. (After reflecting for a short time, during which his hand gradually sinks.) Mean, dastardly, and barbarous! No, no, no. Thank Heaven there still are other means. (Casts the dagger from him, and hastens away. Eboli rushes from the room through the opposite door.)
Scene Scene , another of the Queen's Apartments.—The Queen and Fuentes are discovered. Queen. What a commotion there is in the palace! Every
[Page 131]
noise I hear to-day alarms me, Countess.—Pray enquire what it means.
                                         [Exit Fuentes. Eboli rushes into the room pale and breathless. Ebo. (Falls at the Queen's feet.) Help, help! He is imprisoned.
Queen. Who?
Ebo. The Marquis Posa arrested him by the King's order.
Queen. Whom, whom?
Ebo. The Prince.
Queen. Have you lost your senses?
Ebo. Alas! I saw him led away.
Queen. And who arrested him?
Ebo. The Marquis Posa.
Queen. Well, Heaven be thanked that it was the Marquis!
Ebo. Can you say that so calmly? Oh Heavens, my gracious lady, you know not—
Queen. Why he was arrested? For some error, I suppose, [775]   natural in a youth of violent passions.
Ebo. No, no, no!—Oh Heavens! Cursed diabolical deed! Nothing can save him. He must die.
Queen. Die!
Ebo. And I am his murderer.
Queen. Die! You rave. Reflect on what you say.
Ebo. Oh, had I known this would have been the consequence—
Queen. (Takes her hand with a friendly mien.) Princess, compose yourself. Collect your scattered spirits, and calmly —not in tones which make me shudder—tell me what you know, and what has happened.
Ebo. Oh, do not overwhelm me thus with kindness. It seizes on my conscience like the flames of hell. I am not worthy to raise my eyes and view the glory which surrounds
[Page 132]
your virtues. Trample, I beseech you, trample on the wretch, who, with all the sensations of repentance, shame, and self-abhorrence, writhes at your feet.
Queen. Unfortunate woman, what have you to confess?
Ebo. Angel of light, as yet you are ignorant that you have kindly smiled upon a demon.—I was the wretch who robbed you.
Queen. You!
Ebo. And who delivered your papers to the King.
Queen. You!
Ebo. I was the wretch who accused you—
Queen. [800]   You!—Could you —
Ebo. Love, vengeance, and madness were my guides. I hated you, and loved the Infant.
Queen. If you loved him—
Ebo. I avowed my passion, and it was rejected.
Queen. (After a pause.) Alas! Now, all is clear.— Rise. You loved him. I forgive you. It is forgotten.— Rise. (Assists her.)
Ebo. No, no. There yet remains a horrible confession. Not till then great Queen——
Queen. What am I still doomed to hear? Proceed.
Ebo. The King——Seduction——Oh you avert your countenance. I read your dreadful sentence in your looks. ——The crime with which I charged you—I myself committed. (Falls to the earth, and hides her burning blushes. The Queen retires, and a long pause ensues. In a few minutes Olivarez comes from the room into which the Queen went, and finds Eboli in her former situation. She approaches, upon which Eboli starts up with a frantic look, and perceives the Queen is gone.)
Ebo. Heavens! She has left me. Then all is over.
Oli. Princess Eboli—
Ebo. I know why you are come. The Queen has sent you to announce her will. Quick—let me hear it.

[Page 133]
Oli. I am commanded by her Majesty to claim your cross and keys.
Ebo. (Takes the cross from her neck, and delivers it to Olivarez.) Yet may I not be allowed once more to kiss her hand? Surely, oh surely, the best of Queens will not—
Oli. In the convent of St. Mary you will be told what is determined respecting you.
Ebo. (Whose tears gush from her eyes.) I shall never see [825]   the Queen again, then?
Oli. (Embraces her with averted face.) Farewell.
                                         [Exit instantly. (Eboli follows her to the door, which is shut upon her. She sinks on her knees, and remains in this attitude for some minutes, then rises, hides her face, and rushes out.) Enter Queen and Olivarez . Queen. Is she gone?
Oli. Yes, and in despair. How dreadful is her lot!
Queen. (Goes to a window, with looks of uneasiness.) Where can the Countess Fuentes be? I told her to obtain information—
Enter a Page, who whispers to Olivarez . Oli. Duke Alba and Domingo beg permission—
Queen. Duke Alba and Domingo! Domingo and Duke Alba!
Oli. They only request a short audience.
Queen. (After some consideration.) Conduct them hither.
                                         [Exeunt Olivarez and Page. Enter Alba and Domingo . Alba. Gracious Queen, if we may be allowed—
Queen. What is the motive for this visit?

[Page 134]
Dom. An honest anxiety for your Majesty's safety.
Alba. We have hastened hither, by timely information, to defeat a plot which is formed against you—
Dom. And to lay at your Majesty's feet this testimony of our zeal and services.
Queen. (Looks at them with astonishment.) Reverend father —and you, noble Duke—you really surprise me. I did not expect such zeal from Domingo, or from Duke Alba, and know how to value it properly. You mention a plot formed against me. May I ask by whom?
Alba. We intreat you to be on your guard against a Marquis Posa, who is secretly employed by his Majesty.
Queen. [850]   I am rejoiced to hear his Majesty has made so good a choice, I have long since been told of the Marquis Posa's talents and integrity. Never was favour more properly bestowed.
Dom. More properly bestowed! We know it otherwise.
Alba. We have long been acquainted with this man's employments and utility.
Queen. What means this? You excite my curiosity.
Dom. Is it long since your Majesty looked into your cabinet?
Queen. How?
Dom. And when you looked into it, did you miss nothing?
Queen. I do not understand you. That I have missed several articles the whole court knows. But how is the Marquis Posa concerned in this?
Alba. Very essentially; for the Prince, too, has lost papers of the utmost importance, which were this morning seen in the King's hands, during the Marquis Posa's private audience, since which his Highness has been arrested, and the Marquis declared prime-minister.
Queen. Strange! Unaccountable! I find a foe where I suspected none, and two friends whom I never dreamt that I
[Page 135]
possessed. For, to confess the truth, (Rivetting her eyes upon them,) I was on the point of pardoning your unkind offices towards me with respect to his Majesty.
Alba. Our unkind offices!
Queen. [875]   Your's.
Dom. Duke Alba! Our's!
Queen. (Still attentively observing them.) How happy am I, therefore, to be so soon aware of my error. I had, indeed, previously resolved to request, to-day, that his Majesty would produce my accusers. Your visit, therefore, gratifies me, for now I can call for Duke Alba's testimony.
Alba. Mine! Are you serious?
Queen. Why not?
Dom. Would you thus defeat all the private services, which—
Queen. Private! (With dignified solemnity.) Duke Alba, I wish to know what your monarch's consort can have to discuss with you, or with this priest, which her lord may not know.—Am I innocent or guilty?
Dom. What a question!
Alba. But if the King were not just—I mean for the present moment—
Queen. Then I must wait till he becomes so. Happy are they who feel sure of success, when justice predominates. Farewell.                                          [Exeunt Alba and Domingo. Enter Posa . At length I again see you, Marquis. You are welcome.
Posa. (Whose looks are disordered, whose voice faulters, and who, throughout this scene, conveys every idea of a mind in the most dreadful state of agitation.) Is your Majesty alone? Can no one in the adjoining rooms hear our discourse?

[Page 136]
Queen. [900]   We are secure. What tidings bring you? (Looks at him more minutely, and starts.) Heavens! What mean these altered features?
Posa. You, perhaps, already know—
Queen. That Carlos is a prisoner, and through you, I have been told. It is true, then! None but yourself would I have believed.
Posa. It is true.
Queen. Through you?
Posa. Through me.
Queen. (With a doubtful look.) I revere your actions even when I do not comprehend them; but, on this occasion, pardon a female's terrors. I fear you play a desperate game.
Posa. I have lost it.
Queen. God of Heaven!
Posa. Be at ease. You are provided for. The loss falls on myself.
Queen. Oh! What must I hear?
Posa. For who urged me to set my all upon a doubtful die? Who urged me thus to sport with the decrees of Heaven? I, though a mortal, have dared to seize the helm of fate, and, feeling that I cannot guide it, I allow my punishment is just. But why do I dwell on this? Every moment is precious. Who knows but that my judge has already sent the executioner to seize me?
Queen. [925]   Your judge!—This solemn tone! Oh! explain the dreadful meaning of your words.
Posa. He is saved—it matters not at what price——yet only for to-day. Few moments are his own.—Let him make good use of them, for I have not bought them at a very moderate price. He must quit Madrid this very night.
Queen. This very night!
Posa. Every preparation is made for his escape. At the convent which has long been the resort of our friendship, he will find a conveyance, and attendants in whom he may confide.
[Page 137]
Here is, in bills of exchange, all that fortune has bestowed upon me. What is wanting you will supply. I must own I have much upon my mind which Carlos should have known—much which he must know; but I probably may not be enabled to mention every thing in person; therefore, as you will see him this evening, I have recourse to you—
Queen. As you value my repose, speak more intelligibly. What has happened?
Posa. I have still a confession of importance to make, and to you I make it. Mine has been a fortune which but few enjoy. I loved a monarch's son. My heart, devoted but to one, made him its world. In the soul of Carlos I could see the paradise of millions.—Oh how delightful were these visions! But it has pleased eternal Providence to nip my [950]   great idea in its bud, and Roderigo soon will be no more. Here—here, on this holy altar—here, in the heart of his Queen, the object of his love and adoration, I deposit my last sacred legacy. Here may he find it, when I shall be no more! (Turns away, and tears choke his utterance.)
Queen. This is the language of a dying man. Still I hope that is but the warmth of fancy—or am I to conceive that there is serious meaning in your words?
Posa. (Has endeavoured to compose himself, and proceeds in a firmer tone.) Tell him to be mindful of the oath which, in the days of enthusiasm, we confirmed by the sacrament. Mine I have adhered to. Faithful to him I have remained to death—
Queen. To death!
Posa. Tell him to remember his. Remind him of his vow to model a new government. Whether he succeeds or fails ought not to be of importance. Sufficient is it for him that he has attempted the noble project we agreed upon.— When centuries have passed, Providence may send another prince, who, fired with the same enthusiasm, may complete
[Page 138]
what he began. Tell him, that when he mounts the throne, he must bear in mind the Infant's vows; must not expose the blossom of his great ideas to that destructive insect policy; and must not be led astray by that base wisdom which would defeat the heavenly projects of enthusiasm. I have already discoursed with him upon this head—
Queen. [975]   But wherefore, Marquis—
Posa. (With great solemnity.) And tell him that on his mind I rest the happiness of nations: that I required this at my dying hour, and felt myself justified in the demand. It was in my power to have spread a new morning through this land. The King granted me his confidence—called me his son. I bear his seal, and Alba is no more. (Pauses, and surveys the Queen.) In tears!—Sweet soul! I know those tears—they are the effect of joy. Right!—Carlos or I!— The choice was sudden, and was dreadful. One must be lost—I chose to be the one. Ask no more.
Queen. Now—now at last I begin to understand you. Unhappy man, what have you done?
Posa. I have sacrificed two evenings to enjoy one cheerful, glorious day.—The King I resign; for what can I be to him? In this parched soil none of my roses bloom. My projects of present alteration were childish and absurd. What, then, could I do? The fate of Europe rests in the hands of Carlos. To him I resign it, and, till he gains possession, it must bleed beneath the sway of Philip. But woe be to Carlos and to me, should I repent the choice which I have made—should I have mistaken the will of Heaven,—should I have acted thus for one, who—
Queen. Do not proceed, Marquis. What you fear will never happen. I know your friend, and can answer for his [1000]   noble mind.
Posa. That alone lay heavy on my mind. Never, never will it happen, for I have your promise. (After a pause.) I saw this unfortunate passion take root in his heart. At that
[Page 139]
time it was in my power to have checked it; but I did not. On the contrary I encouraged it. The world may be of another opinion, but I do not repent my conduct—my conscience does not accuse me. I saw life where others would have seen destruction. In this hopeless passion I beheld the golden beams of hope. I wished to teach him what was excellent, and I perceived that wonder-working love would aid my project.
Queen. And could you, Marquis, could you seriously think me so divested of all female weakness, when you employed love as one of his defences? You reflected not what dangers the heart encounters when love is dignified with the title of virtue.
Posa. You speak of your sex in general. My plans were founded on the principles of one . Can you be ashamed of exciting a passion, which is founded upon virtue? Is King Philip injured when a painter admires the wonders of the Escurial? Does the sweet music of the lute belong to him, who, though devoid of harmony, purchases the instrument? He has bought the privilege of breaking it, but not the art of calling forth its melting tones. A contemplative mind [1025]   searches for truth—a feeling heart submits to beauty's power. You and Carlos belong to each other. No paltry prejudices shall make me alter this opinion. Promise that you will love him—promise, and vow to me that you will love him for ever.
Queen. I promise that my heart alone shall ever be my guide.
Posa. Now I die willingly. My work is done.
                                         [Going. Queen. Marquis, are you going—without telling me when—how soon—we shall again see each other!
Posa. (With averted face.) Rest assured we shall again see each other.
Queen. (Gazes at him.) I understand you well. Oh Posa, why have you done this?

[Page 140]
Posa. He or I—
Queen. No, no. You have been hurried away by the idea of an exalted action. I know you have long wished for such an opportunity of falling. Should it break a thousand hearts, what cares your pride for that? Oh, now I know you well. All you have aimed at has been admiration.
Posa. (Astonished, and aside.) I was not prepared for this.
Queen. (After a pause.) Marquis is escape impossible?
Posa. It is.
Queen. Recollect yourself. Can I do nothing?
Posa. [1050]   Nothing.
Queen. Not even by a crime? You do not know me. I have courage.
Posa. That I do know.
Queen. Escape is impossible?
Posa. Quite impossible.
Queen. (Hides her face.) Go. I no longer value any man on earth.
Posa. (Falls at her feet, in most violent agitation.) Queen!—Oh God! I own that life is sweet.
                                         [Springs up, and exit. Scene Scene , the King's antichamber. Alba and Domingo are seen walking up and down, separated and silent.— Lerma comes from the King's cabinet, and, at the same time, Taxis enters the antichamber. Ler. Has not the Marquis yet appeared?
Alba. No. (Lerma is about to return.)
Tax. Count Lerma, be pleased to announce me.
Ler. The King will see nobody.
Tax. Tell him he must see me. Much, very much depends upon an instant audience.
                                         [Exit Lerma.
[Page 141]
Alba. (Approaches Taxis.) Dear Taxis accustom yourself to patience. You will not be admitted.
Tax. Why not?
Alba. Because you have not used the precaution of soliciting permission from the Marquis Posa, who can make the King a prisoner as well as his son.
Tax. Posa! True! That is the very man from whom I received this letter.
Alba. What letter?
Tax. Which I was to forward for him to Brussels.
Alba. [1075]   Brussels!
Tax. And which I now bring to his Majesty.
Alba. Brussels! Chaplain, did you hear that? Brussels!
Dom. (Approaching.) It is very suspicious.
Tax. It was confided to me with evident anxiety and embarrassment.
Dom. Anxiety and embarrassment! Indeed?
Alba. And to whom is it addressed?
Tax. To the Prince of Orange.
Alba. To William! Chaplain, treason lurks here.
Dom. How can it be otherwise? This letter must be delivered to the King without delay. How meritorious is it, worthy man, to be thus zealous in your monarch's service!
Tax. Reverend father, I do no more than my duty.
Alba. You have acted wisely and properly.
Re-enter Lerma . Ler. Don Raimond de Taxis is wanted.                                          [Exit Taxis. Is the Marquis not yet come?
Dom. He has been sought for in every place.
Ler. This is very singular.
Alba. Singular indeed. The Prince is imprisoned, and the King knows not yet for what reason. How did his Majesty receive the news?

[Page 142]
Ler. He said not a word. (A noise is heard in the cabinet.)
Alba. What was that?
Tax. (Appears at the door.) Count Lerma. (Both go in.)
Alba. [1100]   Domingo, what means this?
Dom. Taxis spoke as if he was alarmed. Should this intercepted letter—Duke, I dread some misfortune.
Alba. He sent for Lerma, yet he knows that you and I are here.
Dom. Our day is past.
Alba. True. I am not the man, at whose approach every door opened. Every thing around me wears a different appearance.
Dom. (Has approached the door.) Hark!
Alba. (After a pause.) All is silent as death. I can even hear them breathe.
Dom. The double tapestry intercepts the sound.
Alba. Away! Some one comes.
Dom. (Leaves the door.) I feel as if my life depended on this moment.
Enter Parma, Feria, Medina , and other Grandees. Par. Can the King be seen?
Alba. No.
Par. No! Who is with him?
Fer. The Marquis Posa, I presume.
Alba. He is every moment expected.
Par. We are this moment arrived from Saragossa. The alarming news is spread through all Madrid. It is, then, true?
Dom. Alas, yes.
Fer. It is true that he is imprisoned by the Marquis?
Alba. [1125]   Exactly.
Par. But why has this happened?
Alba. Why. That no one knows but the Marquis.

[Page 143]
Par. Without assembling the Cortes!
Fer. Cursed be the man, who proposed this innovation on our rights!
Alba. Cursed be he! That say I also.
Med. And I.
The other Grandees. And all.
Par. Who will follow me into the cabinet? I will throw myself at the King's feet—
Lerma rushes from the cabinet. Ler. Duke Alba!
Dom. At last! Heaven be praised! (Alba goes in.)
Ler. (Breathless and in great agitation.) Should the Marquis Posa come, his Majesty is not alone, and will summon him when at liberty.
Dom. (To Lerma, around whom all crowd.) Count, what has happened? You are pale as death.
Ler. (Is hastening away.) Diabolical!
Par. and Fer. What do you mean?
Med. How is the King disposed?
Ler. He has shed tears.
Dom. Shed tears!
All. (Struck with astonishment.) The King shed tears! (A bell is rung. Lerma hastens into the cabinet.)
Dom. Count, another word—pardon me.—He is gone. [1150]   In what a dreadful state of doubt he leaves us!
Enter Eboli , with distracted looks. Ebo. Where is he? I must see him. (To Feria.) Duke lead me to him instantly.
Fer. The King is engaged on matters of the utmost importance. No one can be admitted.
Ebo. Is he then already signing the bloody sentence? He is imposed upon. I can prove he is imposed upon.

[Page 144]
Dom. (From a distance casts a significant look towards her.) Princess Eboli!
Ebo. (Approaches him.) Are you here too, priest? You are the man I want. You shall confirm what I have to say. (Seizes his hand, and draws him to the cabinet.)
Dom. I! Are you in your senses, Princess?
Fer. Stay where you are. The King will not attend to you at present.
Ebo. He must. Truth he must attend to.
Dom. Hold, I beseech you, hold!
Ebo. Wretch! Thou may'st tremble at thy idol's anger. I have nothing to fear. (As she rushes into the cabinet, Alba appears.)
Alba. (Whose eyes sparkle, and whose mien conveys the idea of complete triumph, hastens towards Domingo and embraces him.) Order a Te Deum in every church. The victory is our's.
Dom. Our's!
Alba. (To the Grandees.) Now go in to his Majesty. You shall all hear further from me.
                                         [Exeunt.

END OF ACT IV.

[Page 145]
ACT V. Scene Scene , an Apartment in the Palace, separated by iron bars from a large court, in which centinels walk to and fro. Carlos is discovered sitting at a table, with his head lying on his arms, as if he was asleep. In the back ground are Officers. Posa enters, and whispers to the Officers, who immediately retire. He approaches Carlos , unperceived, and surveys him awhile. At length Carlos raises his head, sees Posa , and starts. Posa. 'Tis I, Carlos.
Car. (Presents his hand.) You even come once more to me. That is kind.
Posa. I fancied you might want a friend.
Car. Did you indeed? I am glad to hear it. Oh, I knew you would remain faithful.
Posa. I have deserved that you should think so.
Car. Oh, we understand each other well. This mercy, this mildness becomes such souls as ours.—I grant that one of my requests may have been rash and unreasonable; yet, on that account, you would not deny me those which are the reverse. Virtue may be rigid, but never can be cruel and inhuman. It is not my fault that my joys must be the victims of your duty. You may, at all events, pity me.
Posa. You mistake me, Carlos. I have never been unworthy of your friendship.
Car. But I have been unworthy of your's.
Posa. Hear me, Carlos, I have much to say, and every moment is of value.

[Page 146]
Car. Say not one word. I believe it cost you much—I believe that your gentle heart bled when you decorated the victim for the altar.
Posa. Carlos, what mean you?
Car. You will now complete what I should have done, [25]   but could not. You will bestow on Spain those golden days which they from me in vain expected. With me all is at an end. That you foresaw. Oh, this dreadful passion has blighted all the early blossoms of my mind. All the hopes you centered in me were dead—you saw it. Providence or Chance led you to the King.—By disclosing my secret he was your's—and you may be his angel. I am irrecoverably lost—perhaps Spain is so too. Alas! In nothing have I been so much to blame as in not having discovered till to-day that your ideas are as exalted as your friendship was sincere.
Posa. (Rousing himself from extreme astonishment.) No. —This I did not foresee—I did not expect that the generosity of a friend would be more inventive than my cautious policy. My plan is ruined—I forgot your heart.
Car. Had you been able to have spared her this load of sorrow, I should have been most grateful. Why might not I suffer alone? But no more of this. I will not load you with reproach. What is the Queen to you? Do you love her? Can I expect that your rigid virtue will regard the petty cares of my attachment? Pardon me. I was unjust.
Posa. You are unjust, but not on this account. If I deserved one reproach I should deserve all—and, in that case, I should not be here. (Draws forth his pocket-book.) Here are some of the papers which you entrusted to my care. Take them again.
Car. (Looks with astonishment alternately at Posa and the papers.) [50]   How!
Posa. I return them, because they will now be safer in your hands than in mine.

[Page 147]
Car. How am I to understand this? The King has not read them, then?
Posa. These papers!
Car. You did not shew them all to him?
Posa. Who told you that I shewed one to him?
Car. (Overpowered with astonishment.) Is it possible? —Count Lerma.
Posa. Lerma!—I understand this—but who could foresee it?—Lerma!—That man never yet deceived. His information was right. The remaining papers are in the King's possession.
Car. But why am I here?
Posa. To prevent the folly of making Eboli your confidante a second time.
Car. (As if awaking from a dream.) Ha! now all is clear—
Posa. Who comes?
Enter Alba . Alba. (Approaches Carlos respectfully, and throughout this scene, turns his back to Posa.) Prince, you are free.— His Majesty has sent me to announce it. (Carlos looks with surprise at Posa.)
Posa. His Majesty can punish or can pardon as he pleases, but I must own I think it strange the Prince should be released before I have been heard.
Alba. (To Carlos, without looking at Posa.) [75]   At the same time I am happy in being the person appointed to convey—
Car. (Gazes at them both with complete astonishment.) I have been imprisoned and released, then, without knowing a reason for either.
Alba. By a mistake, I understand, to which his Majesty was led by some—deception.

[Page 148]
Car. But it is by his Majesty's command that I am here?
Alba. Yes, by a mistake of his Majesty.
Car. I am sorry to hear it; yet, if the King has made a mistake, it becomes him to atone for this in person. Am I not King Philip's son? Am I a proper object for curiosity and scandal? I will not appear obliged to you for that which the King feels to be his duty. I am ready to appear before the assembly of the Cortes, and from your hands I will not take my sword.
Alba. The King will have no objection to make this reasonable acknowledgment, if your Highness will accompany me into his presence.
Car. That will I not. Here I remain till he or all Madrid conducts me from my prison. Bear this answer to him. (Alba goes, and, for some time, is seen to deliver orders in the court.)
Car. Explain all this, I beseech you. Are you not the minister, then?
Posa. I have been, as you see. (Walks towards him with great emotion.) Oh Carlos, my project has succeeded. [100]   Heaven be thanked! It has succeeded.
Car. Succeeded! I do not understand you.
Posa. (Grasps his hand.) Carlos, thou art rescued—thou art free—and I— (Pauses.)
Car. And you?
Posa. And I———I press thee for the first time to my breast, fully and completely justified. I have bought this privilege with every thing dear to me.—Oh Carlos, what a moment is this! I am satisfied with myself.—
Car. What a sudden alteration in your features! I never saw you thus before. Your breast seems to heave with secret satisfaction, and your eyes beam with almost supernatural lustre.
Posa. I rejoice that I have reached the goal of my career. Your's now begins. Carlos, we must take leave of each other. Start not. Be a man, and whatever you may hear,
[Page 149]
promise that you will not, by grief unworthy of an exalted soul, make our separation more distressing. You will lose me, Carlos—for many years—fools would say for ever. (Carlos draws back his hand, and looks earnestly at Posa.) Be a man. I have placed great reliance on you; and have not hesitated to pass with you that awful hour which is called the last . Yes. I own I anticipated our interview with pleasure. Come. Let us be seated—I feel faint and exhausted. (Approaches Carlos, who is lost in terror and astonishment, and who involuntarily allows himself to be drawn to a seat.) Why thus silent and amazed? I will be [125]   brief. The day after I last met you at the Carthusian convent, I was summoned by the King. The result of my audience is known to you and all Madrid; but you are ignorant that your secret passion had been betrayed; that your letters had been stolen from the Queen; that I learnt this from the King's own lips; and that I was entrusted with his entire confidence. (Pauses, as if expecting a reply from Carlos, who remains silent.) Yes, Carlos. I myself regulated the plot for your destruction. Your crime was manifest; your acquittal impossible. To draw his vengeance towards myself was all that I could do, and thus I became your enemy, that I might the better serve you.——Do you hear me?
Car. I do, I do. Proceed.
Posa. Thus far I was right. But soon I was betrayed by the resplendent beams of royal favour. Fame conveyed reports to you, as I might have foreseen; but I, prompted by false tenderness for your peace of mind, and dazzled by the proud idea of completing what I had begun without assistance, concealed the dangerous secret from my friend. This was a great error. I feel it was. My confidence was madness —yet forgive me, Carlos, it was founded on the certainty that our friendship was indissoluble. (Again pauses.
[Page 150]
Carlos awakes from his stupefaction, and begins to be much agitated.) What I feared, happened.—You were made to tremble at imaginary dangers. The Queen bleeding—the [150]   alarm which pervaded the palace—Lerma's unfortunate officiosness —and my unaccountable silence———all these circumstances assailed your heart.—You hesitated—and at last concluded you had lost your friend. But, too noble yourself to doubt his integrity, you ascribed his fall to noble motives, and ventured not to think him false, till you had convinced yourself his breach of faith deserved your praise. Forsaken by the only person you had trusted, you threw yourself into the arms of Eboli,—unfortunate Carlos— into the arms of a fiend, for she it was who betrayed you. (Carlos rises.) I saw you hasten to her. Fearful presages took possession of my soul. I followed you, but came too late. You were at her feet, and the confession already had escaped your lips. You were lost.
Car. No, no. My distress affected her. You are mistaken.
Posa. My mind was filled with the most gloomy apprehensions. I saw no possibility of escape for you.—None in universal nature. Despair made me a monster. I held my dagger to a woman's breast—but suddenly a beam of hope shone in my soul,—an idea, Carlos, bold and exalted— sent by a miracle to rescue thee.—“How,” thought I, “if I succeed in deceiving the King, and convincing him that I am the criminal? Whether it be probable or not, is of little consequence. To Philip possibility will be conviction. Be it so. I will hazard the attempt. Perhaps a blow so sudden [175]   will make the tyrant hesitate; and what more do I want? While he deliberates, Carlos gains time, and can escape to Brabant.”
Car. And you have done this?
Posa. I wrote to the Prince of Orange, that I loved the Queen; that, by the King's mistaken jealousy of you, I
[Page 151]
had eluded his suspicions, and had even induced him to provide me with opportunities of seeing her Majesty. I added, that I feared discovery; that you, being acquainted with my passion, had hastened to the Princess Eboli, probably through her to caution the Queen; that I had immediately arrested you, and, as my plans must now fail, I wished to find a retreat at Brussels.—This letter—
Car. (Hastily interrupts him.) You surely did not entrust to the post. You know that all letters for Brabant and Flanders—
Posa. Will be delivered to the King. According to present appearances, I conceive that Taxis has already done his duty.
Car. Heavens! Then I am lost.
Posa. You! Why you?
Car. Unfortunate man! You too are lost. My father never will forgive so monstrous a deception.
Posa. Deception!—Recollect yourself. Who will tell him that it is a deception?
Car. [200]   Who! I myself. (Going.)
Posa. Hold! You have lost your senses.
Car. For Heaven's sake, let me go. While I stay here, he is, perhaps, instructing the executioner.
Posa. Of so much greater value is our time. We have still much to say.
Car. What! Before he has been told— (Again attempts to go.)
Posa. (Seizes his arm.) Carlos, was I so hasty; was I so conscientious when, in our boyish days, you bled for me?
Car. (Deeply affected.) Oh gracious Providence!
Posa. Away to Flanders! Your destiny is to govern— mine to die for you.
Car. (Takes his hand with extreme emotion.) No. He will not—cannot resist such noble and exalted conduct. I
[Page 152]
will lead you to him. Arm in arm we will appear before him. “Father,” I will say, “thus has a friend acted for his friend.”—Oh, believe me, Roderigo, my father is not devoid of humanity. He will be moved. Tears will gush from his eyes, and he will pardon us. (A musket is discharged from the court.) Ha!—At whom was that aimed?
Posa. (Falls.) I believe—at me.
Car. (Sinks at his side.) Merciful Heavens!
Posa. (In a faultering voice.) The King is quick—I had hoped—longer——think of your escape—do you hear me— of your escape—your mother knows all—I can no more.
                                         [Dies. Carlos falls at his side. In a short time the King enters, accompanied by Alba, Feria, Medina, Parma, Lerma, Domingo , and many other Grandees. He starts back alarmed at the sight. A solemn and universal pause ensues. The Grandees form a semicircle, and look alternately at the King and his son, who still lies without any sign of life. King. (Mildly.) [225]   Infant, I have accorded with your petition, and am come, with the Grandees of Spain, to announce you are at liberty. (Carlos looks up, as if waking from a dream. His eyes are alternately fixed on the King, and on the dead body, but he returns no answer.) Receive your sword again. You have been treated too rashly and severely. (Approaches and presents his hand to raise him.) My son is not in his place. Rise, and come into your father's arms.
Car. (Receives his embrace without being conscious of it, but suddenly recollects himself, and gazes more intently at him.) Thou art a murderer. I cannot embrace thee. (Pushes him back, upon which a commotion arises among the Grandees.) Why this alarm? What have I done? Dared to touch the Lord's anointed! Fear not that I will lay my hand
[Page 153]
upon him. Look at the mark stamped on his forehead That is God's mark.
King. Follow me, my Lords.
Car. Whither so fast? You shall not leave this place. (Forcibly detains him with both hands, one of which accident conducts to the sword brought by the King, and it is drawn by Carlos from the scabbard.)
King. Your sword drawn against your father!
Gran. (Draw.) Regicide!
Car. (Holding the King fast by one hand, and his sword in the other.) Return your swords. What do you mean? Do you suppose that I am mad? If I were, you do ill to remind me that this sword can rob him of existence. (Makes a suspicious motion with it towards the King.) I beg you will stand back. In my situation I should be soothed— therefore stand back. What I have to settle with this monarch has no connexion with your oath of allegiance.— Look at his bloody hands—look here, too. This is his [250]   work.
King. (To the Grandees, who anxiously crowd round him.) Stand back, all of you. Why are you alarmed?—Is he not my son?—I will see to what shameful excess nature—
Car. Nature!—Her reign is past, and murder has succeeded her. The bonds of sweet humanity are rent asunder— rent asunder by thee. Shall I respect what is despised by thee? Look here, look here. Never before was such an act of barbarity perpetrated. Is there no superintending Providence, that King's dare make such ravages?—Since man was born of woman, one, and only one, died as undeservedly as this man. Dost thou know what thou hast done?—No. Thou know'st not that the life which thou hast taken, was of far greater importance to mankind than thine, and that of all thy counsellors. Thou art a common beggar, and hast broken into a sanctuary to steal a pearl, merely that thou mightst earn two paltry reals.—Oh, it is horrible!

[Page 154]
King. (In a mild tone.) If I have been too rash, does it become my son, for whom I have been so, to call me to account?
Car. How! Is it possible thou dost not suspect of what value he was to me? He was—tell him, my Roderigo—assist this omniscient monarch to solve the enigma.—He was my friend . (Universal astonishment pervades the assembly.) And would you know why he died? He died for me.
King. Ha! 'Tis as I suspected.
Car. [275]   Much loved martyr, pardon me if I recount thy virtues to a being so incapable of feeling their value. But let this great politician blush that his grey wisdom was defeated by the penetration of a youth. Yes. We were brothers—brothers by a nobler tie than consanguinity. His life was love. His love for me robbed him of life. He was my friend when he exalted you by his regard, when his eloquence sported with your haughty spirit. You fancied that you governed him, and were but the humble instrument of his exalted projects.—My imprisonment was caused by the well digested ideas of friendship. That he might rescue me, he wrote a letter to the Prince of Orange—Oh heavens! That he might rescue me, he voluntarily threw himself into the arms of death.—You bestowed your royal favour on him— but he died for me. You forced upon him your friendship and your confidence.—Your sceptre was a toy he played with, then cast it away, and——died for me. (The King's eyes are fixed on the earth, and all the Grandees observe him with astonishment and fear.) And was it possible you could give credit to so gross an artifice? How mean must his opinion of you have been when he attempted to impose upon you thus? You dared to hope for his esteem, yet failed in the first trial which he made of you. Oh no! That man was not formed to be your friend. You could only murder him.
Alba. (Who has never withdrawn his eyes from the King,
[Page 155]
approaches fearfully.) My Liege, be not thus silent, I beseech [300]   you. Look round. Speak to your friends.
Car. He was not your enemy—nay, for some time he felt a regard for you. Perhaps he might have made you happy, for his heart was so rich that even its overflowings might have satisfied a Philip. The fragments of his mind would have deified you. By murdering him you have robbed yourself. Oh royal fool! What would you give to restore a soul like this?—Could you even recal your younger days— could you even counteract the law of mortality—could you even wear your crown till the general resurrection—you would not be able to form one idea equal to the worst which this creative brain produced. Nature never produced but one such man, and here—here—(Saviour of mankind!) here he lies weltering in his blood. (A solemn pause. Many of the Grandees turn away, and others hide their faces.) Oh you, who are assembled here, you, whose astonishment and horror are so palpable, blame not the youth, who thus addresses his father and his king. Look here! This man died for me.—Can you weep? Are you human beings? Look here—and then condemn me if you can.— (Turns to the King with more composure.) You, perhaps, are waiting to know the issue of this unnatural conduct.—There is my sword—you are my king again. Think you that I dread your vengeance?—Murder me too, as you have murdered the noblest of your subjects. I know that I have forfeited [325]   my life, and of what value is it to me? Here I renounce all my expectations in this world. Seek a son among strangers. Here lies my only kingdom—— (Falls on the dead body, and attends to nothing which afterwards passes. In the mean time, a distant tumult is heard, mixed with the sound of bells. All the Grandees preserve a solemn silence. The King's eyes wander through the assembly, but are not met by those of any other person.)
King. What means this? Every eye fixed on the ground.
[Page 156]
Will no one answer me?—Every face concealed!—I read your meaning in your silence. My subjects have passed sentence on me. (The same silence prevails through the assembly, and the tumult approaches.)
Ler. (To Alba.) Surely there is a disturbance—
Alba. (Whispers.) I fear there is.
Other Gran. (Who have hastened to the windows.) All the churches proclaim there is a riot.
Ler. They come.
Enter an Officer. Off. Rebellion! Where is the King? (Espies him, and forces his way.) My Liege, the whole city is in arms. The soldiers have united with the people, and a multitude surrounds the palace. It is reported that Prince Carlos is in danger. The populace insist on seeing him alive, or threaten to destroy Madrid.
All the Gran. Save the King, save the King.
Alba. Conceal yourself, my Liege. You are in danger. We know not yet at whose instigation—
Ler. By the subterraneous passage to Aranjuez.—
Alba. (To the King, who seems quite unconcerned.) You return no answer. Rebellion—my Liege—rebellion! Can you be silent?
King. (Rouses himself, and turns with dignity to the assembly.) [350]   Am I still the King of Spain?—No. These cowards weep at the raving exclamations of a boy. They only wait to receive the signal of revolt. I am betrayed.
Alba. What a dreadful suspicion!
King. There pay your homage—there, to your young sovereign. I am a weak old man—I am nothing.
Alba. Can you suspect our loyalty? (With a commanding look.) Spaniards! (All crowd round the King, and kneel with drawn swords. Carlos remains close to the dead body, forsaken by every one.)

[Page 157]
King. (Tears his robes away, and casts them from him.) Clothe your new monarch with these royal robes. Make me his footstool— (Falls into the arms of Alba and Lerma.)
Ler. Help! Heavens!
Fer. Gracious God! What an alarming circumstance.
Alba. It is but a temporary indisposition. Not a word of it abroad, as you value your lives.
Ler. Rebellion in the capital! Spain without a head.
Alba. (Proudly raises himself.) Who says that? (Leave the King in the arms of Lerma and Feria.) Convey him to bed. I will, in the mean time, restore tranquillity.
                                         [Exit. (The King is carried away, followed by all the Grandees, Carlos alone still remains close to the dead body. After a few moments Mercado appears, looks fearfully around, and surveys the Prince awhile unperceived, till at length the latter raises himself.) Mer. I come from her Majesty. (Carlos turns away and is silent.) My name is Mercado. I am her Majesty's surgeon, and here are my credentials. (Delivers a ring to Carlos, who still returns no answer.) The Queen wishes much to see you to-day. Matters of importance—
Car. Nothing is now of importance to me in this world.
Mer. A commission, left by the Marquis Posa—
Car. (Starts up.) [375]   What!—I go instantly.
Mer. No. Not now, Prince. You must wait till night. Every avenue is doubly guarded, and to approach the Queen's apartments unperceived is quite impossible.
Car. But—
Mer. One plan, and one only is practicable. The Queen herself devised it, and has employed me to communicate it; but it is bold, singular, and romantic—
Car. Name it.
Mer. A report has long prevailed, that in the vaulted galleries of the palace, our late Emperor's ghost wanders, in the habit
[Page 158]
of a monk. This rumour is credited among the centinels, who are struck with terror when they enter on that duty. If you be resolved to make use of this disguise, you may easily escape the notice of every one, and find your way to her Majesty's apartment, which this key opens. Your sacred habit protects you from every assault. But you must form your resolution on the spot, and your Highness will find the necessary disguise in your chamber. I must hasten with your answer to the Queen.
Car. And the hour?
Mer. Midnight.
Car. (After a pause.) Tell her she may expect me.
                                         [Exit Mercado. Enter Lerma . Ler. Save yourself, Prince. The King is enraged against you, and a plot is laid against your liberty, if not your life. [400]   Ask me no further questions. I have stolen away to apprise you of your danger. Fly without delay. As yet you may find opportunity to escape, but soon it will be too late.
Car. I am under the guidance of the Almighty.
Ler. The Queen has told me that you must leave Madrid immediately—even to-day, and fly to Brussels.—Delay not your flight, I most earnestly beseech you. The riot favours it, and for this reason only did her Majesty excite it. Just at this moment no one will dare to use force against you. At the Carthusian convent you will find horses, and here are arms, if you should be compelled— (Delivers a dagger and pistols.)
Car. Count Lerma, I am your grateful debtor.
Ler. Heaven protect you on your way! Your conduct to day has pierced my very soul. No friend was ever more attached. All patriots mourn your fate. I dare not at present say more.

[Page 159]
Car. Count Lerma, my departed friend called you an honest man.
Ler. Once more farewell, and heaven preserve you! Happier times will come, but I shall then be no more. Accept my homage now. (Kneels.)
Car. (Endeavours to prevent it, and is deeply affected.) No, Count, no——you unman me—
Ler. (Kisses his hand with great emotion.) Farewell, King of my offspring, farewell. Perhaps my children may die in your defence, though such is not my destiny. In them remember [425]   me. May you return in peace to Spain, and be rewarded for your sufferings by the power of dispensing happiness to your subjects! But accept, my Prince, the counsel of a well-wisher. Undertake no project by which the blood of your father may be shed. Philip compelled your grandfather to abdicate his crown, and that same Philip now trembles at his son. Remember this, good Prince, and heaven protect you!
                                         [Exit. (Carlos is about to depart on the other side, but suddenly turns, falls on the dead body, and clasps it in his arms; then draws a ring from Posa's finger, rises, and hastily quits the place.) Scene Scene , the King's Antichamber, lighted. Enter Alba and Feria . Alba. The commotion is at an end. How did you leave the King?
Fer. In a most dreadful state. He has locked the door of his apartment, and will allow no one to enter. The treachery of the Marquis has at once altered his nature. We no longer know him.
Alba. I must see him. A discovery of the utmost consequence has just been made.
Fer. Another discovery?
Alba. A Carthusian friar, who had secretly stolen into
[Page 160]
the Prince's room, and with eagerness listened to a recital of Posa's death, raised suspicion in my spies, who seized and examined him. Fear forced from him a confession that he was the bearer of important papers, which the deceased had strictly charged him to deliver to the Prince.
Fer. Well?
Alba. The letters indicate that Carlos purposes to leave [450]   Madrid between midnight and morning.
Fer. What?
Alba. That a ship awaits him at Cadiz, and will bring him to Flushing; and that the Netherlands, on his arrival, will at once throw off the Spanish yoke.
Fer. Ha! What means this?
Alba. Other letters state that the Turkish fleet has already sailed from Rhodes, to attack the King of Spain in the Mediterranean, according to agreement.
Fer. Is it possible?
Alba. These very letters prove the object of Posa's extensive travels, which was no other than to arm all the northern powers in behalf of Flanders.
Fer. Amazing!
Alba. To one of the letters is attached a plan of the whole campaign, which was, at once and for ever, to make Flanders independent. Nothing is omitted. Instructions relative to the attack are accompanied by provision against a repulse.— All the resources of the country are minutely described, and all the rules laid down, which the allied powers agree to obey. The project is diabolical—but really deserves admiration.
Fer. What well-conducted treason!
Alba. Mention is also made of a private interview, which is to take place between Don Carlos and her Majesty, on the evening previous to his flight.
Fer. [475]   How! that implies it will take place to-night.

[Page 161]
Alba. At twelve o'clock. I have already used the necessary precautions, for not a moment must be lost.
Enter Domingo . Dom. Where is the Prince? Have no orders been given to secure him.
Alba. No.
Dom. And can you think his Majesty safe, while this madman is at liberty and possessed of arms?
Alba. I must see the King.
Fer. You cannot. His door is locked.
Alba. I'll break it open then. The increasing danger justifies me. The king must be saved. (As he goes to the door, it is opened, and the King appears. All are alarmed at his looks, which bear evident traces of his late attack. He passes the Grandees with long and solemn strides, and gazes at each of them. At length he stops, and casts his eyes on the floor.)
King. Restore this man to life. I must have him again.
Dom. (Apart to Alba.) Speak to him.
King. He had a mean opinion of me when he died. I must have him again.
Alba. (Approaches.) My Liege—
King. Who speaks? (Turns, and for a long time gazes at the whole assembly.) Have you forgotten who I am? Why are you not upon your knees? I am a King, and still demand obedience. Do you all think yourselves justified in rebellion, because one despised me?
Alba. Forget the worthless wretch, my Liege.
King. Worthless! What maniac brands him with that epithet?—Worthless! By my soul it were much easier for [500]   thee to die guiltless, than to become the equal of the man whom thou callest worthless.

[Page 162]
Alba. We beseech your Majesty for leave to speak. Another foe of more importance than the Marquis still exists in Spain.
Fer. Don Carlos—
King. He had a friend, who died for him, when he might have shared my kingdom. Oh shame, shame, can thy ignominous blush mount even to the cheeks of Kings?—Sacrificed for a boy—hated by my advisers, and banished from my confidence—banished from this circle——Yes. These are the proper counsellors for Philip.
Alba. Do you no longer recognize your faithful friends, my Liege?
King. How did he look down on me—with far more pride than monarchs, when seated on the throne, can look down upon their subjects! Heavens! What a loss is mine.
Dom. (To Alba.) Duke, we must not longer—
King. Oh that he were still alive! I would give the Indies to recover him. How impotent are kings, though termed almighty! Can regal power atone for a rash act, by restoring animation? Alas! No. Who, then, can say that I am happy? Step forth, ye sycophants; fill my ears with flattery; exhibit all the machinery of admiration; [525]   praise me; deify me; worship me. Yes. You I still possess; but he, who possessed my esteem, is dead. In what do the living interest me?—Oh, in nothing. This age produced but one independent man— but one .—He despised me —and died.
Alba. Our lives, then, are of no importance. Spaniards, let us hasten to our graves. Even when dead, this man deprives us of our sovereign's favour.
King. (Seats himself, and props his head upon his arm.) I loved him with the affection of a father. He was the first whom I had ever loved, and no one knows what I intended
[Page 163]
to bestow upon him. All Europe may curse me, but I deserved gratitude from him.
Dom. By what amazing charm—
King. And for whom did he fall a voluntary victim? For that boy my son. Never! It is impossible. A Posa could not die for a stripling. Friendship alone could never fill a Posa's heart. It beat for the whole world; for this and every future generation. How could he, then, reconcile to himself such treason against human nature?—Oh, it is evident. He did not sacrifice Philip for Carlos, but an old man for his friend and pupil. My setting sun had not power to nourish his designs—he turned, therefore, to that which is about to rise.
Alba. Read his motives in these letters.
King. (Rises.) He might be mistaken. As yet I am myself. [550]   Nature, accept my thanks. I feel in these limbs all the vigour of a youth. (With enthusiasm.) I will make him an object of derision. I will prove that his virtue was a chimera, and his death folly. In his fall he shall draw after him his friend, and the happiness of the age in which he lived. For a short time the world is still mine; and I will avail myself so well of this short time, that, during ten generations, no one shall reap a harvest from the desolated land which I will leave. (Stalks to and fro with rapid strides.) He has sacrificed me to his idol humanity. On human nature, then, I'll wreak my vengeance,—and with his puppet I'll begin. (To Alba.) What said you of the Infant, and what do these letters contain?
Alba. These letters, my Liege, contain the Marquis Rosa's legacy to your son.
King. (Reads the papers, while every one minutely observes him. After having perused them awhile, he lays them aside, and paces the apartment.) Send to the grand inquisitor, and say I request the favour of his attendance. (One
[Page 164]
of the Grandees goes. Expectation appears in every countenance. Alba and Domingo exchange significant looks. The King again reads the papers.) This very night, then?
Tax. At two o'clock a conveyance will be ready at the Carthusian cloister.
Alba. And people, whom I employed to make observations, saw several chests carried thither, on which the royal arms were visible.
Fer. It is reported, too, that large sums have been remitted by Moorish agents to Brussels, in the name of her [575]   Majesty.
King. Where was the Infant last seen?
Alba. Close to the corpse.
Dom. Which he has, doubless, left since that time, to proceed in business more urgent.
King. Is there any light in the Queen's apartments?
Alba. No, my Liege. A profound silence prevails. She dismissed her attendants sooner than usual; and the Duchess of Arcos, who last came away, left her already asleep.
Enter an Officer of the guard. He draws Feria aside, and whispers; upon which the latter turns with surprise to Alba . The other Grandees crowd round them, and a murmur arises. Fer. Tax. and Dom. (Together.) Very extraordinary!
King. What now?
Fer. Intelligence, my Liege, which scarcely deserves credit—
Dom. Two of the centinels, who have just left their post, declare—but it is a most ridiculous report
King. Well?
Alba. That the ghost of our late Emperor appeared in the left wing of the palace, and passed them with solemn steps. The rumour is confirmed by all the centinels on the same
[Page 165]
station, who add, that the spectre entered the apartments of her Majesty.
Fer. They cannot all be mistaken.
King. And in what form did he appear?
Off. In the very habit which he wore before his death, when he was a monk of the order of Saint Ieronymo.
King. [600]   As a monk! The centinels knew him when he was alive, then, or how could they ascertain it was the Emperor?
Off. He had a scepter in his hand.
Dom. Report says that he has been often seen in this habit.
King. Did no one speak to him?
Off. No one dared. The soldiers said a prayer, and respectfully allowed him to proceed.
King. And the spectre was observed to enter the Queen's apartments?
Off. It certainly entered her Majesty's antichamber.
King. (After a pause.) What do you all think of this?
Alba. My Liege, we know not what to think.
King. (After having reflected awhile.) Let my guards be stationed at every entrance to the wing, and on their lives let them allow no one to leave it. I wish to have some conversation with this ghost.
                                         [Exit Officer. Enter a Page. Page. My Liege, the grand inquisitor—
King. (To the Grandees.) Leave us.
Enter Grand Inquisitor, blind, decrepid, supported by a stick, and led by two Dominican Friars. As he passes, all the Grandees fall, and touch the edge of his garment. He bestows his blessing upon them, and they, as well as the Friars, withdraw. The King follows them through two rooms, and bolts every door.
[Page 166]
Inq. Am In in the presence of the King?
King. You are.
Inq. I never expected to be again sent for.
King. I renew a scene of former times. Philip the Infant applies to his tutor for instruction.
Inq. My pupil Charles, your most illustrious father, never [625]   was in want of instruction.
King. So much the happier was he. I have requested your attendance, because I must beg your aid.
Inq. My aid, or that of the church?
King. Your mind, and the arm of the church. (After a pause.) Cardinal, I have committed murder, and my peace of mind—
Inq. Why did you commit murder!
King. A deception unexampled—
Inq. I know it.
King. Know it! Through whom?
Inq. For whole years I have known what you have learnt since sun-set.
King. (Astonished.) You were acquainted with this man's designs?
Inq. Every action of his life is recorded in the sacred register of our office.
King. And yet he was at liberty?
Inq. The chain by which he was held, was long, but indissoluble.
King. But he was some time out of my dominions.
Inq. Wherever he was, I was also.
King. (Walks to and fro displeased.) It was known in whose hands I was, yet I received no warning.
Inq. Withdraw that observation. Why did you confide in this man before you had made enquiries respecting him? [650]   You knew he was a heretic, and neglected to deliver him into our hands. Are we treated thus? If majesty so far degrades itself, as to form connexions with our determined
[Page 167]
foes, what must become of us? Why must three hundred thousand souls be sacrificed, if one of the same sentiments is chosen to be favourite and prime minister?
King. He is also sacrificed.
Inq. No, he is murdered—basely, infamously murdered. The blood which ought to have flowed for the glory of our church was shed by an assassin. He was our's, and by what were you justified in seizing our property? He was appointed to die by our hands. Heaven had fixed upon him to be a terrible example. Long has it been my determination to have shewn him as a public spectacle upon the wheel, but you have defeated my project. You have robbed the Holy Order, and stained your own hands with blood.
King. I was hurried away by passion. Forgive me.
Inq. Passion! Is that the answer of Philip the King, or Philip the Infant? Am I alone grown old?—Passion! (Shakes his head.) Let every conscience in your realms be free, if you are such a slave.
King. I am still a novice in these things. Have patience with me.
Inq. No. I am dissatisfied with you. You have disgraced your reign. Where was that Philip, whose soul was [675]   firm and unalterable? Had he forgotten all his past actions, when the hand of a heretic was offered and accepted? Was poison no longer poison? Was the barrier between good and evil, between truth and falsehood, broken down? What is firmness, what is resolution, what is consistency, if in a single moment the maxims founded on the experience of sixty years, can vanish from the mind?
King. I looked at his countenance. Pardon my remark, but man has one avenue less when he approaches you, for you have lost your sight.
Inq. But of what use could this man be? What could he say which you did not already know? Are you so little acquainted with the language of innovation and enthusiasm?—
[Page 168]
If your conviction can be conquered by words, with what effrontery dare you sign the sentence of a hundred thousand souls, who are doomed to die for nothing worse?
King. I wanted to find a man. This Domingo, whom you recommended to me—
Inq. A man! Men are to you but cyphers. Must I again instruct my hoary headed pupil in the elements of government? An earthly God should learn to feel no wants but such as can be gratified. If you wish others to sympathize with you, is it not evident that you acknowledge others to be your equals—and by what right, I would know, do you claim authority over your equals?
King. (Throws himself into a chair.) [700]   I am a weak man. I feel it. You require of the creature, what can only be done by the Creator.
Inq. No. Me you will not impose upon. You are discovered. You wanted to escape us. The bondage of our Holy Order was oppressive. You wanted to be independent, but we are revenged. Be thankful that the church is satisfied with chastising you as a parent. The choice which you were blindly allowed to make was your punishment. You have gained instruction by the issue, and now we again receive you. Had you not sent for me to-day, by the Almighty, I would have sent for you to-morrow.
King. Moderate your warmth, Priest. I shall not tamely submit to such language.
Inq. Why have you cited the ghost of Samuel to appear? I have reared two Kings for Spain, and hoped my labour was at an end. To have lived in vain is a painful sensation at ninety years of age. I crave your pardon—and now, why did you send for me? My time is precious, and I do not wish to repeat my visit.
King. Once more let me employ you—and only once. Peace is resolved between us, and the past is forgotten. We are friends.

[Page 169]
Inq. (Presents his hand.) If Philip be submissive.
King. My son is guilty of high treason.
Inq. [725]   What mean you to do?
King. Every thing or nothing.
Inq. What mean you by every thing?
King. He must escape from Spain—or die.
Inq. (Listening with eagerness.) Proceed.
King. Can you mention any thing, which will diminish the horror of decreeing a son's death?
Inq. To satisfy eternal justice the Son of God died on the cross.
King. You will propagate this opinion throughout Europe.
Inq. Throughout Christendom.
King. Nature revolts at the idea. Can you silence her, too?
Inq. Faith listens not to nature.
King. To you I transfer my office. May I be entirely neutral?
Inq. Deliver him to me.
King. He is my only son. For whom have I obtained and preserved my extensive realms?
Inq. (With fire.) For destruction rather than freedom.
King. We are of the same opinion. Come.
Inq. Whither?
King. To receive the victim from my hand.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene , the Queen's Apartment. Enter Carlos in the habit of a monk, with a drawn sword under his arm, and a mask on his face. It is quite dark. He takes off his mask, and approaches a door, which is opened. The Queen appears, with a taper, which she places on a marble slab. Car. (Kneels.) Elizabeth!

[Page 170]
Queen. Alas! Is it thus we meet again? (Endeavours to compose herself.) [750]   Rise. Let us not distress each other, Carlos. He who died for his friend wishes not that we should shed useless tears. Let them be reserved for occasions less important. Posa bought your life with his. You feel the value of this sacrifice. Carlos, I myself answered for you, and the pledge I gave made him die more willingly. You will not prove my assertions false.
Car. (With enthusiastic ardour.) I will erect such a monument to his memory as no King was ever honoured with. A paradise shall flourish over his ashes.
Queen. This is as I wished. This was the great design he formed when he devoted himself to death. He fixed on me to be the executrix of his last will, and I charge you, Carlos, to bear in mind the promise you have made. (A pause.) He bequeathed to me another legacy—I promised—and why should I conceal the truth? He bequeathed to me his friend —his Carlos. I despise all false appearances, and will no longer tremble at a mortal's frown. You perceive, Carlos, that I am not afraid of admitting you at this hour. I will be bold as becomes a friend, and openly declare my sentiments. Posa called our attachment virtuous. I believe him, and will no longer—
Car. Mother, end not what you have begun. Let no falsehood pollute those lips. You have known the godlike man—he never could wish you should degrade yourself. [775]   Let us not deceive each other. I have long been haunted by an oppressive dream, but I am now awake. Forget all that has happened. Take back your letters, and destroy my own. Fear no return of my wild paroxysms—they are past. My being is refined by a much purer flame. My passion now dwells in the tomb of the dead. This bosom no longer harbours one mortal wish. (After a pause.) Give me your hand. I came to take leave of you.

[Page 171]
Queen. (Turns away, and says, in a voice which proves her contending sensations.) Carlos——
Car. Be not surprised. This is not a sacrifice, for it has not cost me a pang. I at length perceive that there is something more worthy of ambition than to possess Elizabeth. A few hours have roused my latent faculties; have ripened my ideas. In this world I have nothing to do but to remember the instructions of my friend. (Approaches the Queen, who hides her face.) I go. Have you nothing to say, mother?
Queen. Pay no regard to my tears, Carlos—I cannot suppress them—but believe me, I admire your resolution.
Car. You alone were acquainted with our friendship, and this will for ever make you the most dear to me of any one on earth. I am as unable to grant you my friendship as I was yesterday to bestow my affections on any other woman. Sacred to me shall be the royal widow, should Providence conduct me to the throne. The King, Grand Inquisitor, and Grandees appear in the back ground unperceived. I now leave Spain, and shall not see my father again in [800]   this world. I no longer respect or love him. The natural feelings of a son are stifled in my bosom. Be you again a wife to him. He has lost a son. Return to your duties. I hasten to rescue an oppressed and injured nation from the hands of tyranny. Madrid shall see me again as a King, or shall never see me. And now a long farewell, dear mother. Kiss your son.
Queen. Oh Carlos! I cannot, dare not endeavour to acquire these great sensations, but I can comprehend them, and admire their owner.
Car. Am I not firm, Elizabeth? I hold you in my arms, and maintain my resolution. Yesterday no power on earth could have torn me from your embrace. Farewell. (Leaves
[Page 172]
her.) It is accomplished. Now, I defy fate. I held her in my arms and maintained my resolution.———Ha! What was that?
Queen. What mean you?
Car. Did you not hear some one breathe behind us?— Hark! (A clock strikes.)
Queen. I hear nothing but the dreadful clock, which warns you to depart.
Car. Farewell then. From Ghent you will receive my first letter. After that time, my conduct towards King Philip shall be public. You need not dread the discovery. Farewell. This shall be my last deception. (Is about to take his mask.)
King. (Steps between them.) [825]   It is thy last. (Queen falls to the earth.)
Car. (Hastens to her, and supports her.) Is she dead! Oh heaven and earth!
King. (With perfect apathy to the Inquisitor.) Cardinal, I have done my duty. Now do your's.

ADVERTISEMENT. Various reports were circulated respecting this piece, when it was first performed. Another Translator, in an address to the Public, asserted that he had been “ungenerously treated” by the Proprietors of the Theatre Royal Drury-Lane, and laid to their charge “the undisguised appropriation of the whole of his play,” which they had previously refused, and returned to him. I should have thought this accusation too contemptible for notice, had it not in some degree influenced the opinions of several respectable periodical critics, who, finding it impossible to credit so preposterous a charge, ascribed to superior interest the preference which had been given to my translation. This conjecture is, however, erroneous; for at the time I transmitted The Stranger to Drury-Lane Theatre, I was totally unknown to any of the Proprietors, and had no introduction to them, but through the play itself. Mr. Grubb, to whom I sent it with a few lines, put it into the hands of Mr. Sheridan, who was so kind as to improve its effect by several alterations and additions. To both these gentlemen I acknowledge my grateful obligations; and also return sincere thanks to the several performers for their exertions.

PROLOGUE. [By Linley, W.] WRITTEN BY W. LINLEY, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MR. BARRYMORE.
When first the Comic Muse with forceful art
Essayed to triumph o'er the yielding heart,
With trembling zeal at Fancy's awful shrine
Graceful she bent, and claim'd the wreath divine.
“To me” (she cries) “the mingled powers belong
Of wit, of humour, dance, and social song;
Mine the glad task to check the rising sigh,
And wipe the glistening drop from Beauty's eye:
On me the blooming loves and graces smile,
And crown with eager praise my cheerful toil.
The Tragic Muse, too oft thy favourite care,
May sanction, still, th' unobtruding tear;
May wake to passion, or to pity move,
Rouse to despair, or melt the soul to love:
But oh! How sweetly beaming thro' the maze
Of fiction'd grief, Thalia darts her rays!
With double zest she feeds the listening ear,
And rapture dawns thro' Pity's transient tear.”
“Equal in power” (the impartial goddess cried)
“Ye both are suitors, both to be denied:
Nor can the wreath on either head be wove,
When both have equal claim to grace and love:—
But go; collect your powers; that path explore
Which leads to Albion's still united shore;
[Page ]

There, if near Drury's walls you chance to stray,
And meet a timid Stranger on his way,
Give to my fearful charge your equal aid,
Protect and guide him thro' the scenic shade;
And as my favourite Shakespeare struck the lyre,
Warm'd by an equal portion of your fire,
Still with impartial zeal your force employ,
And ope to him the source of grief and joy.”
Thus Fancy spoke—each Muse reclin'd her head,
A hesitating blush their cheeks o'erspread.
Have they then deign'd to prop our author's cause?—
What's to decide the question?—Your applause.

EPILOGUE. [By Lewis, M. G.] WRITTEN BY M. G. LEWIS, ESQ. M. P. SPOKEN BY MR. SUETT, AS A GIPSEY.
In Norwood's spell-fraught shades and haunted bow'rs,
From public eye remote I pass my hours;
There gives this magic crutch imperial sway,
And shirtless tribes their tag-rag queen obey.
Silence!—I wave my wand!—With rev'rence view it,
And hear the oracles of Goody Suett.
Hark! hark! How many female tongues I hear
Lisp—“Oh! my stars! The Gipsey-queen, my dear!
“A person of great fashion, I'll assure ye;
“But what the devil brings her now to Drury?”
Peace, and I'll tell you. Yet, without a shilling,
To speak the Gipsey-tribe is seldom willing.
Nor holds the Sybill o'er old Nick command,
Unless with silver first you cross her hand.
A different mode, I own, suits best with me:
'Till answer'd your demands, I'll ask no fee;
But hope to find you, when my art is shown,
Instead of crossing my hand, clap your own.
Know, in my secret grot retir'd, of late
A spell I cast to learn this Drama's fate,
When, lo! the cave was fill'd with sulph'rous smoke,
And distant hisses midnight's slumber broke!
I mark'd the omens dire with doubt and fear,
Saddled my broom-stick, and strait hurried here,
Dame Haller's cause to plead in accents humble;
For I, like her, have known what 'tis to stumble.
[Page ]

When youth my cheeks with roses lov'd to deck,
And auburn ringlets grac'd my iv'ry neck,
Then did my artless bosom dare to harbour
Too fond a flame for a too faithless barber!
Great were his charms, too great for words to state 'em:
Sweeter his manners were than rose-pomatum:
But ah! though seeming candour grac'd his looks,
His heart was falser than his own peruques!
Oft at my feet in am'rous grief he knelt,
Oft painted pangs and flames he never felt:
I strove to fly, but vain was each endeavour;
I listen'd, lov'd, and was undone for ever!
Excuse these tears! and let my pray'rs prevailing
Induce you to forgive Dame Haller's failing;
The malice of her foes with plaudits stem;
Nor when her spouse absolves, do you condemn.
Should you refuse me, dread my vengeance; dread
My imps at midnight shrieking round your bed!
Dread too—But Hecate calls! I must away,
Though I've a thousand things still left to say:
But as my stay cannot be now protracted,
I'll tell you more next time this play is acted.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. The skirts of Count Wintersen's park. The park gates in the centre. On one side a low lodge among the trees. On the other, in the back ground, a Peasant's hut. Enter Peter . Pet. Pooh ! pooh!—never tell me.—I'm a clever lad, for all father's crying out every minute, “Peter,” and “Stupid Peter!” But I say, Peter is not stupid, though father will always be so wise. First, I talk too much; then, I talk too little; and, if I talk a bit to myself, he calls me a driveller. Now, I like best to talk to myself; for I never contradict myself; and I don't laugh at myself, as other folks do. That laughing is often a plaguy teazing custom. To be sure, when Mrs. Haller laughs, one can bear it well enough; there is a sweetness even in her reproof, that somehow—But, lud! I had near forgot what I was sent about.—Yes, then they would have laugh'd at me indeed.— (Draws a green purse from his pocket.) —I am to carry this money to old Tobias; and Mrs. Haller said I must be sure not to blab, or say that she had sent it. Well, well, she may be easy for that
[Page 2]
matter; not a word shall drop from my lips. Mrs. Haller is charming, but silly, if father is right: for father says, “He that spends his money is not wife:” but “he that gives it away is stark mad.”
Enter Stranger , from the lodge, with his arms folded, his head hanging down, followed by Francis .—At sight of Peter, Stranger stops, and looks suspiciously at him. Peter stands opposite to him with his mouth wide open. At length he takes off his hat, scrapes a bow, and goes into the hut. Stra. Who is that?
Fra. The steward's son.
Stra. Of the castle?
Fra. Yes.
Stra. —(After a pause.) [25]   —You were speaking last night—
Fra. Of the old countryman?
Stra. Ay.
Fra. You would not hear me out.
Stra. Proceed.
Fra. He is poor.
Stra. Who told you so?
Fra. He himself.
Stra. —(With acrimony.) —Ay, ay; he knows how to tell his story, no doubt.
Fra. And to impose, you think?
Stra. Right!
Fra. This man does not.
Stra. Fool!
Fra. A feeling fool is better than a cold Sceptic.
Stra. False!
Fra. Charity begets gratitude.

[Page 3]
Stra. False!
Fra. And blesses the giver more than the receiver.
Stra. True.
Fra. Well, Sir. This countryman—
Stra. Has he complained to you?
Fra. Yes.
Stra. He who is really unhappy never complains.— [50]   (Pauses.) —Francis, you have had means of education beyond your lot in life, and hence you are encouraged to attempt imposing on me:—But go on.
Fra. His only son has been taken from him.
Stra. Taken from him?
Fra. By the exigency of the times, for a soldier.
Stra. Ay!
Fra. The old man is poor:—
Stra. 'Tis likely.
Fra. Sick and forsaken.
Stra. I cannot help him.
Fra. Yes.
Stra. How?
Fra. By money. He may buy his son's release.
Stra. I'll see him myself.
Fra. Do so.
Stra. But if he prove an impostor:—
Fra. He is not.
Stra. In that hut?
Fra. In that hut.— (Stranger goes into the hut.) —A good master, tho' one almost loses the use of speech by living with him. A man kind and clear—tho' I cannot understand him. He rails against the whole world, and yet no beggar leaves his door unsatisfied. I have now lived three years with him, and yet I know not who he [75]   is. A hater of society, no doubt; but not by Providence intended to be so. Misanthropy in his head , not in his heart .

[Page 4]
Enter Stranger and Peter from the hut. Pet. Pray walk on.
Stra. —(To Francis.) —Fool!
Fra. So soon returned!
Stra. What should I do there?
Fra. Did you not find it as I said?
Stra. This lad I found.
Fra. What has he to do with your charity?
Stra. The old man and he understand each other perfectly well.
Fra. How?
Stra. What were this boy and the countryman doing?
Fra. —(Smiling, and shaking his head.) —Well, you shall hear.— (To Peter.) —Young man, what were you doing in that hut?
Pet. Doing?—Nothing.
Fra. Well, but you couldn't go there for nothing?
Pet. And why not pray?—But I did go there for nothing though.—Do you think one must be paid for every thing?—If Mrs. Haller were to give me but a smiling look, I'd jump up to my neck in the great pond for nothing.
Fra. It seems then Mrs. Haller sent you?
Pet. [100]   Why, yes—But I'm not to talk about it.
Fra. Why so?
Pet. How should I know? “Look you,” says Mrs. Haller, “Master Peter, be so good as not to mention it to any body.”— (With much consequence.) —“Master Peter, be so good”—Hi! hi! hi!—“Master Peter, be so”—Hi! hi! hi!—
Fra. Oh! that is quite a different thing. Of course you must be silent then.
Pet. I know that; and so I am too. For I told old
[Page 5]
Tobias—says I, “Now, you're not to think as how Mrs. Haller sent the money; for I shall not say a word about that as long as I live,” says I.
Fra. There you were very right. Did you carry him much money?
Pet. I don't know; I didn't count it. It was in a bit of a green purse. Mayhap it may be some little matter that she has scraped together in the last fortnight.
Fra. And why just in the last fortnight?
Pet. Because, about a fortnight since, I carried him some money before.
Fra. From Mrs. Haller?
Pet. Ay, sure; who else, think you? Father's not such a fool. He says it is our bounden duty, as Christians, to take care of our money, and not give any thing [125]   away, especially in summer; for then, says he, there's herbs and roots enough in conscience to satisfy all the reasonable hungry poor. But I say father's wrong, and Mr. Haller's right.
Fra. Yes, yes.—But this Mrs. Haller seems a strange woman, Peter.
Pet. Ay, at times she is plaguy odd. Why, she'll sit, and cry you a whole day through, without any one's knowing why.—Ay, and yet, somehow or other, whenever she cries, I always cry too—without knowing why.
Fra. —(To Stranger.) —Are you satisfied?
Stra. Rid me of that babbler.
Fra. Good day, Master Peter.
Pet. You're not going yet, are you?
Fra. Mrs. Haller will be waiting for an answer.
Pet. So she will. And I have another place or two to call at.— (Takes off his hat to Stranger.) —Servant, Sir!— (Stranger nods—Peter turns to Francis in a half whisper.) He's angry, I suppose, because he can get nothing out of me.

[Page 6]
Fra. It almost seems so.
Pet. Ay, I'd have him to know I'm no blab.
                                         [Exit. Fra. Now, Sir?
Stra. What do you want?
Fra. Were you not wrong, Sir?
Stra. Hem!—
Fra. [150]   Can you still doubt?
Stra. I'll hear no more! Who is this Mrs. Haller? Why do I always follow her path? Go where I will, whenever I try to do good, she has always been before me.
Fra. You should rejoice at that.
Stra. Rejoice!
Fra. Surely! That there are other good and charitable people in the world beside yourself.
Stra. Oh, yes!
Fra. Why not seek to be acquainted with her? I saw her yesterday in the garden, up at the castle. Mr. Solomon, the steward, says she has been unwell, and confined to her room almost ever since we have been here. But one would not think it to look at her; for a more beautiful creature I never saw.
Stra. So much the worse. Beauty is a mask.
Fra. In her it seems a mirror of the soul. Her charities—
Stra. Pshaw! talk not to me of her charities. All women wish to be conspicuous:—In town by their wit; in the country by their heart.
Fra. 'Tis immaterial in what way good is done.
Stra. No; 'tis not immaterial.
Fra. To this poor old man at least.
Stra. He needs no assistance of mine.
Fra. [175]   His most urgent wants Mrs. Haller indeed relieved; but whether she has or could have given as
[Page 7]
much as would purchase liberty for the son, the prop of his age—
Stra. Silence! I will not give him a doit!— (In a peevish tone.) —You interest yourself very warmly in his behalf. Perhaps you are to be a sharer in the gift?
Fra. Sir, Sir, that did not come from your heart.
Stra. —(Recollecting himself.) —Forgive me!
Fra. Poor master! How must the world have used you, before it could have instill'd this hatred of mankind, this constant doubt of honesty and virtue!
Stra. Leave me to myself!— (Throws himself on a seat; takes from his pocket “Zimmerman on Solitude,” and reads.)
Fra. —(Aside, surveying him.) —Again reading! Thus it is from morn to night. To him, nature has no beauty; life, no charm. For three years I have never seen him smile. What will be his fate at last? Nothing diverts him. Oh, if he would but attach himself to any living thing! Were it an animal—for something man must love.
Enter Tobias from the hut. Tob. Oh! how refreshing, after seven long weeks, to feel these warm sun-beams once again! Thanks! Thanks! bounteous heaven, for the joy I taste.— (Presses his cap between his hands, looks up and prays.—Stranger lets his book drop, and observes him attentively.)
Fra. —(To Stranger.) —This old man's share of earthly happiness can be but little; yet mark how grateful he is [200]   for his portion of it.
Stra. Because, tho' old, he is but a child in the leading strings of Hope.
Fra. Hope is the nurse of life.

[Page 8]
Stra. And her cradle is the grave.— (Tobias replaces his cap, and approaches.) —
Fra. I wish you joy. I am glad to see you are so much recover'd.
Tob. Thank you. Heaven, and the assistance of a kind lady, have saved me for another year or two.
Fra. How old are you, pray?
Tob. Seventy-six. To be sure I can expect but little joy before I die. Yet, there is another, and a better world.
Fra. To the unfortunate, then, death is scarce an evil?
Tob. Am I so unfortunate? Do I not enjoy this glorious morning? Am I not in health again? Believe me, Sir, he, who, leaving the bed of sickness, for the first time breathes the fresh pure air, is at that moment the happiest of his Maker's creatures.
Fra. Yet 'tis a happiness that fails upon enjoyment.
Tob. True; but less so in old age. Some fifty years ago my father left me this cottage. I was a strong lad; and took an honest wife. Heaven blessed my farm with rich crops, and my marriage with five children. This [225]   lasted nine or ten years. Two of my children died. I felt it sorely. The land was afflicted with a famine. My wife assisted me in supporting our family: but four years after, she left our dwelling for a better place. And of my five children one only son remained. This was blow on blow. It was long before I regained my fortitude. At length resignation and religion had their effect. I again attached myself to life. My son grew, and helped me in my work. Now the state has called him away to bear a musket. This is to me a loss, indeed. I can work no more. I am old and weak; and true it is, but for Mrs. Haller, I must have perished.

[Page 9]
Fra. Still then life has its charms for you?
Tob. Why not, while the world holds any thing that's dear to me? Have not I a son?
Fra. Who knows that you will ever see him more? He may be dead.
Tob. Alas! he may. But as long as I am not sure of it, he lives to me: And if he falls, 'tis in his country's cause. Nay, should I lose him, still I should not wish to die. Here is the hut in which I was born. Here is the tree that grew with me; and, I am almost ashamed to confess it—I have a dog I love.
Fra. A dog!
Tob. Yes!—Smile if you please: but hear. My benefactress [250]   once came to my hut herself, some time before you fixed here. The poor animal, unused to see the form of elegance and beauty enter the door of penury, growled at her.—“I wonder you keep that surly, ugly animal, Mr. Tobias,” said she; “you, who have hardly food enough for yourself.”—“Ah, Madam,” I replied, “if I now part with him, are you sure what else will love me?”—She was pleased with my answer.
Fra. —(To Stranger.) —Excuse me, Sir; but I wish you had listened.
Stra. I have listened.
Fra. Then, Sir, I wish you would follow this poor old man's example.
Stra. —(Pauses.) —Here; take this book, and lay it on my desk.— (Francis goes into the lodge with the book.) — How much has Mrs. Haller given you?
Tob. Oh, Sir, she has given me so much, that I can look towards winter without fear.
Stra. No more?

[Page 10]
Tob. What could I do with more?—Ah! true; I might—
Stra. I know it.—You might buy your son's release.— There!— (Presses a heavy purse into his hand, and exit.)
Tob. What is all this?— (Opens the purse, and finds it full of gold.) [275]   —Merciful heaven! Enter Francis. Tobias runs to meet him. Now look, Sir: is confidence in Heaven unrewarded?
Fra. I wish you joy! My master gave you this!
Tob. Yes, your noble master. Heaven reward him!
Fra. Just like him. He sent me with his book, that no one might be witness to his bounty.
Tob. He would not even take my thanks. He was gone before I could speak.
Fra. Just his way.
Tob. Now, Sir, I'll go as quick as these old legs will bear me. What a delightful errand! I go to release my Robert! How the lad will rejoice! There is a girl too, in the village, that will rejoice with him. Oh! Providence, how good art thou! Years of distress never can efface the recollection of former happiness; but one joyful moment drives from the memory an age of misery.
                                         [Exit. Fra. —(Looks after him.) —Why am I not wealthy? 'Sdeath! why am I not a prince? I never thought myself envious; but I feel I am. Yes, I must envy those who, with the will, have the power to do good.
                                         [Exit.
[Page 11]
SCENE II. An antichamber in Wintersen castle. Enter a Maid, meeting Footmen with table and chairs. Maid. Why, George! Harry! where have you been loitering? Put down these things. Mrs. Haller has been calling for you this half hour.
Geo. Well, here I am then. What does she want with me?
Maid. That she will tell you herself. Here she comes.
Enter Mrs. Haller, (with a letter;) a Maid following. Mrs. H. Very well; if those things are done, let the drawing-room be made ready immediately.— (Ex. Maids.) And, George, run immediately into the park, and tell Mr. Solomon I wish to speak with him.— (Ex. Footman.) I cannot understand this. I do not learn whether their coming to this place be but the whim of a moment, or a plan for a longer stay: If the latter, farewell, solitude! farewell, study!—farewell!—Yes, I must make room for gaiety, and mere frivolity. Yet, could I willingly submit to all; but, should the Countess give me new proofs of her attachment, perhaps of her respect, Oh! how will my conscience upbraid me! Or—I shudder at the thought! if this seat is to be visited by company, and chance should conduct hither any of my former acquaintance—Alas! alas! how wretched is the being who fears the sight of any one fellow-creature! But, oh! superior misery! to dread still more the presence of a former friend!—Who's [25]   there?

[Page 12]
Enter Peter . Pet. Nobody. It's only me.
Mrs. H. So soon returned?
Pet. Sharp lad, a'n't I? On the road I've had a bit of talk too, and—
Mrs. H. But you have observed my directions?
Pet. O, yes, yes:—I told old Tobias as how he wou'd never know as long as he lived that the money came from you.
Mrs. H. You found him quite recover'd, I hope?
Pet. Ay, sure did I. He's coming out to-day for the first time.
Mrs. H. I rejoice to hear it.
Pet. He said that he was obliged to you for all; and before dinner would crawl up to thank you.
Mrs. H. Good Peter, do me another service.
Pet. Ay, a hundred, if you'll only let me have a good long stare at you.
Mrs. H. With all my heart! Observe when old Tobias comes, and send him away. Tell him I am busy, or asleep, or unwell, or what you please.
Pet. I will, I will.
Solomon. —(Without.) —There, there, go to the post-office.
Mrs. H. Oh! here comes Mr. Solomon.
Pet. What! Father!—Ay, so there is. Father's a [50]   main clever man: He knows what's going on all over the world.
Mrs. H. No wonder; for you know he receives as many letters as a prime minister and all his secretaries.

[Page 13]
Enter Solomon . Sol. Good morning, good morning to you, Mrs. Haller. It gives me infinite pleasure to see you look so charmingly well. You have had the goodness to send for your humble servant. Any news from the Great City? There are very weighty matters in agitation. I have my letters too.
Mrs. H. —(Smiling.) —I think, Mr. Solomon, you must correspond with the four quarters of the globe.
Sol. Beg pardon, not with the whole world, Mrs. Haller. But— (consequentially) —to be sure I have correspondents, on whom I can rely, in the chief cities of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.
Mrs. H. And yet I have my doubts whether you know what is to happen this very day at this very place.
Sol. At this very place! Nothing material. We meant to have sown a little barley to-day; but the ground is too dry: And the sheep-shearing is not to be till tomorrow.
Pet. No, nor the bull-baiting till—
Sol. Hold your tongue, blockhead! Get about your business.
Pet. Blockhead! There again! I suppose I'm not to [75]   open my mouth.— (To Mrs. Haller.) —Good bye!
                                         [Exit. Mrs. H. The Count will be here to-day.
Sol. How! What!
Mrs. H. With his lady; and his brother-in-law, Baron Steinfort.
Sol. My letters say nothing of this. You are laughing at your humble servant.
Mrs. H. You know, Sir, I'm not much given to jesting.

[Page 14]
Sol. Peter!—Good lack-a-day!—His Right Honourable Excellency Count Wintersen, and her Right Honourable Excellency the Countess Wintersen, and his Honourable Lordship Baron Steinfort—And, Lord have mercy! nothing in proper order!—Here, Peter! Peter!
Enter Peter . Pet. Well, now; what's the matter again?
Sol. Call all the house together directly! Send to the game-keeper: tell him to bring some venison. Tell Rebecca to uncase the furniture, and take the covering from the Venetian looking-glasses; that her Right Honourable Ladyship, the Countess, may look at her gracious countenance. And tell the cook to let me see him without loss of time. And tell John to catch a brace or two of carp. And tell—and tell—and tell—tell Frederick to friz my Sunday wig.—Mercy on us!—Tell— There—Go!— (Exit. Peter.) —Heavens and earth! so little [100]   of the new furnishing of this old castle is completed! —Where are we to put his Honourable Lordship the Baron?
Mrs. H. Let him have the little chamber at the head of the stairs: it is a neat room, and commands a beautiful prospect.
Sol. Very right, very right. But that room has always been occupied by the Count's private secretary. Suppose! —Hold, I have it. You know the little lodge at the end of the park: we can thrust the secretary into that.
Mrs. H. You forget, Mr. Solomon, you told me that the Stranger lived there.
Sol. Psha! What have we to do with the Stranger?— Who told him to live there?—He must turn out.

[Page 15]
Mrs. H. That would be unjust: for you said that you let the dwelling to him, and by your own account he pays well for it.
Sol. He does; he does. But nobody knows who he is. The devil himself can't make him out. To be sure I lately received a letter from Spain, which informed me that a spy had taken up his abode in this country, and, from the description—
Mrs. H. A spy! Ridiculous! Every thing I have heard bespeaks him to be a man who may be allowed [125]   to dwell any where. His life is solitude and silence.
Sol. So it is.
Mrs. H. You tell me too, he does much good, and in private.
Sol. That he does.
Mrs. H. He hurts nothing; not the worm in his way.
Sol. That he does not.
Mrs. H. He troubles no one.
Sol. True; true!
Mrs. H. Well, what do you want more?
Sol. I want to know who he is. If the man would only converse a little, one might have an opportunity of pumping ; but if one meets him in the lime-walk, or by the river, it is nothing but—“Good morrow:”—and off he marches. Once or twice I have contrived to edge in a word—“Fine day.”—“Yes.”—“Taking a little exercise, I perceive.”—“Yes.”—And off again like a shot. The devil take such close fellows, say I. And, like master, like man: not a syllable do I know of that mumps, his servant, except that his name is Francis.
Mrs. H. You are putting yourself into a passion, and quite forget who are expected.

[Page 16]
Sol. So I do—Mercy on us!—There now, you see what misfortunes arise from not knowing people.
Mrs. H. —(Looking at her watch.) [150]   —Twelve o'clock already! If his Lordship has stolen an hour from his usual sleep, the family must soon be here. I go to my duty; you will attend to yours, Mr. Solomon.
                                         [Exit. Sol. Yes, I'll look after my duty, never fear. There goes another of the same class: Nobody knows who she is again. However, thus much I do know of her, that her Right Honourable Ladyship, the Countess, all at once popp'd her into the house, like a blot of ink upon a sheet of paper: But why, wherefore, or for what reason, not a soul can tell. “She is to manage the family within doors.” She to manage! Fire and faggots! Haven't I managed every thing within and without, most reputably, these twenty years? I must own I grow a little old, and she does take a deal of pains: But all this she learned of me. When she first came here— Mercy on us! she didn't know that linen was made of flax. But what was to be expected from one who has no foreign correspondence?
                                         [Exit.

END OF ACT I.

[Page 17]
ACT II. SCENE I. A drawing-room in the castle, with a piano-forte, harp, music, book-stand, sophas, chairs, tables, &c. Enter Solomon . Sol. Well, for once I think I have the advantage of Madam Haller. Such a dance have I provided to welcome their Excellencies, and she quite out of the secret! And such a horn-pipe by the little Brunette! I'll have a rehearsal first, tho'; and then surprise their Honors after dinner.— (Flourish of rural music without.)
Pet. —(Without.) —Stop, not yet; not yet: but make way there, make way, my good friends, tenants, and villagers. —John! George! Frederick! Good friends, make way.
Sol. It is not the Count: It's only Baron Steinfort. Stand back, I say; and stop the music!
Enter Baron Steinfort , ushered in by Peter and Footmen. Peter mimics and apes his father. Sol. I have the honour to introduce to your Lordship myself, Mr. Solomon; who blesses the hour in which fortune allows him to become acquainted with the Honourable Baron Steinfort, brother-in-law of his Right Honourable Excellency, Count Wintersen, my noble master.
Pet. Bless our noble master!
Bar. Old and young, I see they'll allow me no peace. (Aside.) —Enough, enough, good Mr. Solomon. I am a
[Page 18]
soldier. I pay but few compliments, and require as few from others.
Sol. I beg, my Lord—We do live in the country, to [25]   be sure; but we are acquainted with the reverence due to exalted personages.
Pet. Yes—We are acquainted with exalted personages.
Bar. What is to become of me?—Well, well; I hope we shall be better acquainted. You must know, Mr. Solomon, I intend to assist, for a couple of months, at least, in attacking the well-stocked cellars of Wintersen.
Sol. Why not whole years, my Lord? Inexpressible would be the satisfaction of your humble servant. And, though I say it, well-stocked, indeed, are our cellars. I have, in every respect, here, managed matters in so frugal and provident a way, that his Right Honourable Excellency, the Count, will be astonished.— (Baron sits on sopha, not listening.) —Extremely sorry it is not in my power to entertain your Lordship.
Pet. Extremely sorry.
Sol. Where can Mrs. Haller have hid herself?
Bar. Mrs. Haller! Who is she?
Sol. Why, who she is, I can't exactly tell your Lordship.
Pet. No, nor I.
Sol. None of my correspondents give any account of her. She is here in the capacity of a kind of a superior house-keeper. Methinks I hear her silver voice upon the stairs. I will have the honour of sending her to your [50]   Lordship in an instant.
Bar. Oh! don't trouble yourself.
Sol. No trouble, whatever! I remain, at all times, your honourable Lordship's most obedient, humble, and devoted servant.
                                         [Exit, bowing.] Pet. Devoted servant.
                                         [Exit, bowing.]
[Page 19]
Bar. Now for a fresh plague. Now am I to be tormented by some chattering old ugly hag, till I am stunned with her noise and officious hospitality. O, patience! what a virtue art thou!
Enter Mrs. Haller , with a becoming curtsy. Baron rises, and returns a bow, in confusion. (Aside.) —No, old she is not.— (Casts another glance at her.) —No, by Jove, nor ugly.
Mrs. H. I rejoice, my Lord, in thus becoming acquainted with the brother of my benefactress.
Bar. Madam, that title shall be doubly valuable to me, since it gives me an introduction equally to be rejoiced at.
Mrs. H. —(Without attending to the compliment.) —This lovely weather, then, has enticed the Count from the city?
Bar. Not exactly that. You know him. Sunshine or clouds are to him alike, as long as eternal summer reigns in his own heart and family.
Mrs. H. The Count possesses a most cheerful and amiable philosophy. Ever in the same happy humour; [75]   ever enjoying each minute of his life. But you must confess, my Lord, that he is a favourite child of fortune, and has much to be grateful to her for. Not merely because she has given him birth and riches, but for a native sweetness of temper, never to be acquired; and a graceful suavity of manners, whose school must be the mind. And, need I enumerate among fortune's favours, the hand and affections of your accomplished sister?
Bar. —(More and more struck, as her understanding opens upon him.) —True, Madam. My good easy brother too seems fully sensible of his happiness, and is resolved to retain it. He has quitted the service to live here. I
[Page 20]
am yet afraid he may soon grow weary of Wintersen and retirement.
Mrs. H. I should trust not. They who bear a cheerful and unreproaching conscience into solitude, surely must encrease the measure of their own enjoyments: They quit the poor, precarious, the dependant pleasures, which they borrowed from the world, to draw a real bliss from that exhaustless source of true delight, the fountain of a pure unsullied heart.
Bar. Has retirement long possessed so lovely an advocate?
Mrs. H. I have lived here three years.
Bar. And never felt a secret wish for the society you left, and must have adorned?
Mrs. H. Never.
Bar. [100]   To feel thus belongs either to a very rough or a very polished soul. The first sight convinced me in which class I am to place you.
Mrs. H. —(With a sigh.) —There may, perhaps, be a third case.
Bar. Indeed, Madam, I wish not to be thought forward; but women always seemed to me less calculated for retirement than men. We have a thousand employments, a thousand amusements, which you have not.
Mrs. H. Dare I ask what they are?
Bar. We ride—we hunt—we play—read—write.—
Mrs. H. The noble employments of the chace, and the still more noble employment of play, I grant you.
Bar. Nay, but dare I ask what are your employments for a day?
Mrs. H. Oh, my Lord! you cannot imagine how quickly time passes, when a certain uniformity guides the minutes of our life. How often do I ask, “Is Saturday come again so soon?” On a bright cheerful morning my books and breakfast are carried out upon the
[Page 21]
grass-plot. Then is the sweet picture of reviving industry and eager innocence always new to me. The birds' notes so often heard, still waken new ideas: The herds are led into the fields: The peasant bends his eye upon his plough. Every thing lives and moves; and, [125]   in every creature's mind, it seems as it were morning. Towards evening, I begin to roam abroad: From the park into the meadows. And sometimes returning, I pause to look at the village boys and girls as they play. Then do I bless their innocence, and pray to Heav'n those laughing, thoughtless hours could be their lot for ever.
Bar. This is excellent!—But these are summer amusements. —The winter! the winter!
Mrs. H. Why for ever picture winter like old age, torpid, tedious, and uncheerful? Winter has its own delights: This is the time to instruct and mend the mind, by reading and reflection. At this season, too, I often take my harp, and amuse myself by playing or singing the little favourite airs, that remind me of the past, or, solicit hope for the future.
Bar. Happy indeed are they who can thus create and vary their own pleasures and employments.
Enter Peter . Peter. Well—well—Pray now—I was ordered—I can keep him back no longer.—He will come in.
Mrs. H. Who is it you mean?
Pet. Why, old Tobias.
Enter Tobias , (forcing his way.) Tob. I must, good Heaven, I must!
Mrs. H. —(Confused.) —I have no time, at present—I— I—You see I am not alone.

[Page 22]
Tob. [150]   Oh! this good gentleman will forgive me.
Bar. What do you want?
Tob. To return thanks. Even charity is a burthen if one may not be grateful for it.
Mrs. H. To-morrow, good Tobias; to-morrow.
Bar. Nay, no false delicacy, Madam. Allow him to vent the feelings of his heart; and permit me to witness a scene, which convinces me, even more powerfully than your conversation, how nobly you employ your time. Speak, old man.
Tob. Oh, Lady, that each word which drops from my lips, might call down a blessing on your head! I lay forsaken and dying in my hut: Not even bread nor hope remained. Oh! then you came in the form of an angel, brought medicines to me; and your sweet consoling voice did more than those. I am recovered. To-day, for the first time, I have returned thanks in presence of the Sun: And now I come to you, noble Lady. Let me drop my tears upon your charitable hand. For your sake Heaven has blessed my latter days. The Stranger too, who lives near me, has given me a purse of gold to buy my son's release. I am on my way to the city: I shall purchase my Robert's release. Then I shall have an honest daughter-in-law. And you, if ever after that you pass our happy cottage, oh! what must you feel, [175]   when you say to yourself, “This is my work!”
Mrs. H. —(In a tone of intreaty.) —Enough, Tobias, enough!
Tob. I beg pardon! I cannot utter what is breathing in my breast. There is one who knows it. May his blessing and your own heart reward you!— (Exit. Peter following. Mrs. Haller casts her eyes upon the ground, and contends against the confusion of an exalted soul, when surprised in a good action. Baron stands opposite to her,
[Page 23]
and from time to time casts a glance at her, in which his heart is swimming.)
Mrs. H. —(Endeavouring to bring about a conversation.) —I suppose, my Lord, we may expect the Count and Countess every moment now?
Bar. Not just yet, Madam. He travels at his leisure. I am selfish, perhaps, in not being anxious for his speed: The delay has procured me a delight which I never shall forget.
Mrs. H. —(Smiling.) —You satirize mankind, my Lord.
Bar. How so?
Mrs. H. In supposing such scenes to be uncommon.
Bar. I confess I was little prepared for such an acquaintance as yourself: I am extremely surprised. When Solomon told me your name and situation, how could I suppose that—
Mrs. H. My name?—Yes—I don't wish to make it of greater consequence than it is.
Bar. Pardon my curiosity: You have been, or are married?
Mrs. H. —(Suddenly sinking from her cheerful raillery into mournful gloom.) —I have been married, my Lord.
Bar. —(Whose enquiries evince his curiosity, yet are restrained within the bounds of the nicest respect.) —A widow, [200]   then?
Mrs. H. I beseech you—There are strings in the human heart, which touched, will sometimes utter dreadful discord—I beseech you—
Bar. I understand you. I see you know how to conceal every thing, except your perfections.
Mrs. H. My perfections, alas!— (Rural music without.) —But I hear the happy tenantry announce the Count's arrival. Your pardon, my Lord: I must attend them.
                                         [Exit.
[Page 24]
Bar. Excellent creature!—What is she, and what can be her history? I must seek my sister instantly. How strong and how sudden is the interest I feel for her! But it is a feeling I ought to check. And yet, why so? Whatever are the emotions she has inspired, I am sure they arise from the perfections of her mind; and never shall they be met with unworthiness in mine.
                                         [Exit. SCENE II. The Lawn. Solomon and Peter are discover'd arranging the tenantry. Rural Music. Enter Count and Countess Wintersen , (the latter leading her Child,) the Baron , Mrs. Haller , Charlotte , and Servants following. Sol. Welcome, ten thousand welcomes, your Excellencies. Some little preparation made for welcome too. But that will be seen anon.
Count. Well! Here we are! Heaven bless our advance and retreat! Mrs. Haller, I bring you an invalid, who, in future, will swear to no flag but your's.
Mrs. H. Mine flies for retreat and rural happiness.
Count. But not without retreating graces and retiring Cupids too.
Countess. —(Who has in the mean time kindly embraced Mrs. Haller, and by her been welcomed to Wintersen.) — My dear Count, you forget that I am present.
Count. Why, in the name of chivalry, how can I do less than your gallant brother, the Baron, who has been
[Page 25]
so kind as nearly to kill my four greys, in order to be here five minutes before me?
Bar. Had I known all the charms of this place, you should have said so with justice.
Countess. Don't you think William much grown?
Mrs. H. The sweet boy!— (Stoops to kiss him, and deep melancholy overshadows her countenance.)
Count. Well, Solomon, you've provided a good dinner?
Sol. As good as haste would allow, please your Right Honourable Excellency!
Pet. Yes, as good as—
                                         [Count goes aside with Sol. Bar. Tell me, I conjure you, sister, what jewel you [25]   have thus buried in the country.
Countess. Ha! ha! ha! What, brother, you caught at last!
Bar. Answer me.
Countess. Well, her name is Mrs. Haller.
Bar. That I know; but—
Countess. But!—but I know no more myself.
Bar. Jesting apart, I wish to know.
Countess. And, jesting apart, I wish you would not plague me. I have at least a hundred thousand important things to do. Heavens! the vicar may come to pay his respects to me before I have been at my toilet: of course I must consult my looking-glass on the occasion. Come, William, will you help to dress me, or stay with your father?
Will. I had rather stay here.
Count. We'll take care of him.
Countess. Come, Mrs. Haller.
                                         [Exit. with Mrs. Haller, Charlotte following. Bar. —(Aside, and going.) —I am in a very singular humour.
Count. Whither so fast, good brother?
Bar. To my apartment: I have letters to—I—

[Page 26]
Count. Psha! stay. Let us take a turn in the park together.
Bar. Excuse me. I am not perfectly well. I should be but bad company. I—
                                         [Exit. The tenantry retire. Count. Well, Solomon, you're as great a fool as ever, [50]   I see.
Sol. Ha! ha! At your Right Honourable Excellency's service.
Count. —(Points to Peter.) —Who is that ape in the corner?
Sol. Ape!—Oh! that is—with respect to your Excellency be it spoken—the son of my body; by name, Peter.— (Peter bows.)
Count. So, so!—Well! how goes all on?
Sol. Well and good; well and good. Your Excellency will see how I've improved the park: You'll not know it again. A hermitage here; serpentine walks there; an obelisk; a ruin; and all so sparingly, all done with the most economical economy.
Count. Well, I'll have a peep at your obelisk and ruins while they prepare for dinner.
Sol. I have already ordered it, and will have the honour of attending your Right Honourable Excellency.
Count. Come, lead the way. Peter, attend your young master to the house; we must not tire him.
                                         [Exit, conducted by Solomon. Pet. This way, your little Excellency, and we shall see the bridge as we go by; and the new boat, with all the fine ribbands and streamers. This way, your little Excellency.
                                         [Exit, leading the Child.
[Page 27]
SCENE III. The Antichamber. Enter Mrs. Haller . Mrs. H. What has thus alarmed and subdued me? My tears flow; my heart bleeds. Already had I apparently overcome my chagrin; already had I at least assumed that easy gaiety once so natural to me, when the sight of this child in an instant overpowered me. When the Countess called him William—Oh! she knew not that she plunged a poniard in my heart. I have a William too, who must be as tall as this, if he be still alive. Ah! yes, if he be still alive. His little sister too. Why, Fancy, dost thou rack me thus? Why dost thou image my poor children, fainting in sickness, and crying to their mother? To the mother who has abandoned them? — (Weeps.) —What a wretched outcast am I! And that just to-day I should be doomed to feel these horrible emotions! just to-day, when disguise was so necessary.
Enter Charlotte , bellowing at the door. Cha. Your servant, Mrs. Haller. I beg, Madam, I may have a room fit for a respectable person.
Mrs. H. The chamber into which you have been shewn is, I think, a very neat one.
Cha. A very neat one, is it? Up the back stairs, and over the laundry! I should never be able to close my eyes.
Mrs. H. —(Very mildly.) —I slept there a whole year.
Cha. Did you? Then I advise you to remove into it [25]   again, and the sooner the better. I'd have you to know, Madam, there is a material difference between certain persons and certain persons. Much depends upon the
[Page 28]
manner in which one has been educated. I think, Madam, it would only be proper if you resigned your room to me.
Mrs. H. If the Countess desires it, certainly.
Cha. The Countess! Very pretty, indeed! Would you have me think of plaguing her Ladyship with such trifles? I shall order my trunk to be carried wherever I please.
Mrs. H. Certainly; only not into my chamber.
Cha. Provoking creature! But how could I expect to find breeding among creatures born of they know not whom, and coming they know not whence?
Mrs. H. The remark is very just.
Enter Peter , in haste. Pet. Oh lud! Oh lud! Oh lud! Oh lud!
Mrs. H. What's the matter?
Pet. The child has fallen into the river! His little Excellency is drowned!
Mrs. H. Who? What?
Pet. His honor, my young master!
Mrs. H. Drowned?
Pet. Yes.
Mrs. H. Dead?
Pet. No; he's not dead.
Mrs. H. [50]   Well, well, then softly;—you will alarm the Countess.
Enter the Baron . Bar. What is the matter? Why all this noise?
Pet. Noise? Why—
Mrs. H. Be not alarmed, my Lord. Whatever may have happened, the dear child is now at least safe. You said so, I think, master Peter.

[Page 29]
Pet. Why, to be sure, his little Excellency is not hurt; but he's very wet though: and the Count is taking him by the garden door to the house.
Bar. Right, that the Countess may not be alarmed. But tell us, young man, how could it happen?
Pet. From beginning to end?
Mrs. H. Never mind particulars. You attended the dear child.
Pet. True; and he would see the boat and streamers. I turned round only for a moment, and then, oh, how I was scared, to see him borne down the river!
Bar. And you drew him out again directly?
Pet. No, I didn't: 'twas the deepest part; and I never could swim in my life. But I called and bawled as loud as I could: I believe you might have heard me down to the village.
Mrs. H. Ay—and so the people came immediately to his assistance?
Pet. [75]   No, they didn't: but the Stranger came, that lives yonder, close to old Toby, and never speaks a syllable. Odsbodlikins! What a devil of a fellow it is! With a single spring bounces he slap into the torrent; sails and dives about and about like a duck; gets me hold of the little angel's hair, and, heav'n bless him! pulls him safe to dry land.—Ha! ha! ha!
Bar. I think I hear them.
Mrs. H. Is the Stranger with them?
Pet. Oh lud! no. He ran away. His Excellency wanted to thank him, and all that: but he was off: vanished like a ghost.
Enter Solomon . Sol. Oh! thou careless varlet! I disown you! What an accident might have happened! and how you have
[Page 30]
terrified his Excellency! But I beg pardon— (bows) — His Right Honourable Excellency, the Count, requests your—
Bar. We come.
                                         [Exit with Mrs. Haller. Cha. Ha! ha! ha! Why, Mr. Solomon, you seem to have a hopeful pupil.
Sol. Ah! sirrah!
Cha. But, Mr. Solomon, why were you not nimble enough to have saved his young Lordship?
Sol. Not in time, my sweet Miss. Besides, mercy on us! I should have sunk like a lump of lead: and I happened [100]   to have a letter of consequence in my pocket, which would have been made totally illegible: a letter from Constantinople, written by Chevalier—What's his name?— (Draws a letter from his pocket, and putting it up again directly, drops it. Peter takes it up slyly, and unobserved.) —It contains momentous matter, I assure you. The world will be astonished when it comes to light; and not a soul will suppose that old Solomon had a finger in the pie.
Cha. No, that I believe.
Sol. But I must go and see to the cellar. Miss, your most obedient servant.
                                         [Exit. Cha. —(With pride.) —Your servant, Mr. Solomon.
Pet. Here's the letter from Constantinople. I wonder what it can be about. Now for it!— (opens it.)
Cha. Ay, let us have it.
Pet. —(Reads.) —“If so be you say so, I'll never work for you, never no more. Considering as how your Sunday waistcoat has been turned three times, it doesn't look amiss, and I've charged as little as any tailor of 'em all. You say I must pay for the buckram; but I say, I'll be damn'd if I do. So no more from your loving nephew, Timothy Twist.”—From Constantinople! Why cousin Tim writ it.

[Page 31]
Cha. Cousin Tim! Who is he?
Pet. Good lack! Don't you know cousin Tim? Why, [125]   he's one of the best tailors in all—
Cha. A tailor! No, Sir, I do not know him. My father was state-coachman, and wore his Highness's livery.
                                         [Exit. Pet. —(Mimicking.) —“My father was state-coachman, and wore his Highness's livery.”—Well, and cousin Tim could have made his Highness's livery, if you go to that.
                                         [Going. Enter Solomon . Sol. Peter, you ninny, stay where you are. Is that chattering girl gone? Didn't I tell you we would have a practice of our dance, and they are all ready on the lawn. Mark me; I represent the Count, and you the Baron.
                                         [Exit with affected dignity. Peter follows, mimicking. SCENE IV. The Lawn. Seats placed. Rustic Music. Dancers are discovered as ready to perform. Solomon and Peter enter, and seat themselves. A dance. In which the dancers pay their reverence to Solomon and Peter as they pass. At the end Solomon and Peter strut off before the dancers.


END OF ACT II.

[Page 32]
ACT III. SCENE I. The Skirts of the Park and Lodge, &c. as before. The Stranger is discover'd on a Seat reading. Enter Francis . Fra. Dinner is ready.
Stra. I want no dinner.
Fra. I've got something good.
Stra. Eat it yourself.
Fra. You are not hungry?
Stra. No.
Fra. Nor I. The heat takes away all appetite.
Stra. Yes.
Fra. I'll put it by; perhaps at night—
Stra. Perhaps.
Fra. —(After a pause.) —Dear Sir, dare I speak?
Stra. Speak.
Fra. You have done a noble action.
Stra. What?
Fra. You have saved a fellow-creature's life.
Stra. Peace.
Fra. Do you know who he was?
Stra. No.
Fra. The only son of Count Wintersen.
Stra. Immaterial.
Fra. A gentleman, by report, worthy and benevolent as yourself.
Stra. —(Angry.) —Silence! Dare you flatter me?
Fra. As I look to heav'n for mercy, I speak from my [25]   heart. When I observe how you are doing good around you, how you are making every individual's wants your own, and are yet yourself unhappy, alas! my heart bleeds for you.

[Page 33]
Stra. I thank you, Francis. I can only thank you. Yet share this consolation with me:—my sufferings are unmerited.
Fra. My poor master!
Stra. Have you forgotten what the old man said this morning? “There is another and a better world!” Oh, 'twas true. Then let us hope with fervency, and yet endure with patience!—What's here?
Enter Charlotte , from the Park Gate. Char. I presume, Sir, you are the strange gentleman, that drew my young master out of the water?— (Stranger stares at her.) —Or— (To Francis) —Are you he?— (Francis makes a wry face.) —Are the creatures both dumb?— (Looks at them by turns: they stare at her.) — Surely old Solomon has fixed two statues here, by way of ornament; for of any use there is no sign.— (Approaches Francis.) —No, this is alive, and breathes; yes, and moves its eyes.— (Bawls in his ear.) —Good friend!
Fra. I'm not deaf.
Char. Nor dumb, I perceive at last.—Is yon lifeless thing your master?
Fra. That honest silent gentleman is my master.
Char. [50]   The same that save the young Count's life?
Fra. The same.
Char. —(To Stranger.) —Sir, my master and mistress, the Count and Countess, present their respectful compliments, and request the honour of your company at a family supper this evening.
Stra. I shall not come.
Char. But you'll scarce send such an uncivil answer as this. The Count is overpowered with gratitude. You have saved his son's life.
Stra. I did it willingly.

[Page 34]
Char. And won't accept of, “I thank you,” in return?
Stra. No.
Char. You really are cruel, Sir, I must tell you. There are three of us ladies at the castle, and we are all dying with curiosity to know who you are.— (Exit Stranger.) — The master is crabbed enough, however. Let me try what I can make of the man. Pray, Sir— (Francis turns his back to her.) —The beginning promises little enough. Friend, why won't you look at me?
Fra. I like to look at green trees better than green eyes?
Char. Green eyes, you monster! Who told you that my eyes were green? Let me tell you there have been sonnets made on my eyes before now.
Fra. [75]   Glad to hear it.
Char. To the point then at once. What is your master?
Fra. A man.
Char. I surmised as much. But what's his name?
Fra. The same as his father's.
Char. Not unlikely;—and his father was—
Fra. Married.
Char. To whom?
Fra. To a woman.
Char. —(Enraged.) —I'll tell you what: who your master is, I see I shall not learn, and I don't care: but I know what you are.
Fra. Well, what am I?
Char. A bear!
                                         [Exit. Fra. Thank you! Now to see how habit and example corrupt one's manners. I am naturally the civilest-spoken fellow in the world to the pretty prattling rogues: yet, following my master's humour, I've rudely driven this wench away.

[Page 35]
Enter Stranger . Stra. Is that woman gone?
Fra. Yes.
Stra. Francis!
Fra. Sir.
Stra. We must begone too.
Fra. But whither?
Stra. [100]   I don't care.
Fra. I'll attend you.
Stra. To any place?
Fra. To death.
Stra. Heav'n grant it—to me at least! There is peace.
Fra. Peace is every where. Let the storm rage without, if the heart be but at rest. Yet I think we are very well where we are: the situation is inviting; and nature lavish of her beauties, and of her bounties too.
Stra. But I am not a wild beast, to be stared at, and sent for as a shew. Is it fit I should be?
Fra. Another of your interpretations! That a man, the life of whose only son you have saved, should invite you to his house, seems to me not very unnatural.
Stra. I will not be invited to any house.
Fra. For once methinks you might submit. You'll not be asked a second time.
Stra. Proud wretches! They believe the most essential service is requited, if one may but have the honour of sitting at their table. Let us begone.
Fra. Yet hold, Sir! This bustle will soon be over. Used to the town, the Count and his party will soon be tired of simple nature, and you will again be freed from observation.
Stra. Not from your's.
Fra. [125]   This is too much. Do I deserve your doubts?

[Page 36]
Stra. Am I in the wrong?
Fra. You are indeed!
Stra. Francis, my servant, you are my only friend.
                                         (Giving his hand.) Fra. That title makes amends for all.— (Kisses it.)
Stra. But look, Francis; there are uniforms and gay dresses in the walk again. No, I must be gone. Here I'll stay no longer.
Fra. Well then, I'll tie up my bundle.
Stra. The sooner the better! They come this way. Now must I shut myself in my hovel, and lose this fine breeze. Nay, if they be your high-bred class of all, they may have impudence enough to walk into my chamber. Francis, I shall lock the door.— (Goes into the lodge, locks the door, and fastens the shutters.)
Fra. And I'll be your centinel. Should these people be as inquisitive as their maid, I must summon my whole stock of impertinence. But their questions and my answers need little study. They can learn nothing of the Stranger from me; for the best of all possible reasons—I know nothing myself.
Enter Baron and Countess . Countess. There is a strange face. The servant probably.
Bar. Friend, can we speak to your master?
Fra. No.
Bar. Only for a few minutes.
Fra. He has locked himself in his room.
Countess. [150]   Tell him a lady waits for him.
Fra. Then he's sure not to come.
Countess. Does he hate our sex?
Fra. He hates the whole human race, but woman particularly.
Countess. And why?

[Page 37]
Fra. He may perhaps have been deceived.
Countess. This is not very courteous.
Fra. My master is not over courteous: but when he sees a chance of saving a fellow-creature's life, he'll attempt it at the peril of his own.
Bar. You are right. Now hear the reason of our visit. The wife and brother-in-law of the man, whose child your master has saved, wish to acknowledge their obligations to him.
Fra. That he dislikes. He only wishes to live unnoticed.
Countess. He appears to be unfortunate.
Fra. Appears!
Countess. An affair of honour, perhaps, or some unhappy attachment may have—
Fra. They may.
Countess. Be this as it may, I wish to know who he is.
Fra. So do I.
Countess. What! Don't you know him yourself?
Fra. Oh! I know him well enough. I mean his real self—His heart—his soul—his worth—his honor!—Perhaps [175]   you think one knows a man, when one is acquainted with his name and person?
Countess. 'Tis well said, friend; you please me much. And now I should like to know you. Who are you?
Fra. Your humble servant.
                                         [Exit. Countess. Nay, now, this is affectation! A desire to appear singular! Every one wishes to make himself distinguished. One sails round the world; another creeps into a hovel.
Bar. And the man apes his master!
Countess. Come, brother, let us seek the Count. He and Mrs. Haller turned into the lawn.— (Going.)
Bar. Stay. First, a word or two, sister: I am in love.
Countess. For the hundredth time.
Bar. For the first time in my life.

[Page 38]
Countess. I wish you joy.
Bar. 'Till now you have evaded my enquiries. Who is she? I beseech you, sister, be serious. There is a time for all things.
Countess. Bless us! Why, you look as if you were going to raise a spirit. Don't fix your eyes so earnestly. Well, if I am to be serious, I obey. I do not know who Mrs. Haller is, as I have already told you; but what I do know of her, shall not be concealed from you. It may now be three years ago, when, one evening, about twilight, a lady was announced, who wished to speak to me [200]   in private. Mrs. Haller appeared, with all that grace and modesty which have enchanted you. Her features, at that moment, bore keener marks of the sorrow and confusion, which have since settled into gentle melancholy. She threw herself at my feet; and besought me to save a wretch, who was on the brink of despair. She told me she had heard much of my benevolence, and offered herself as a servant to attend me. I endeavoured to dive into the cause of her sufferings, but in vain. She concealed her secret, yet opened to me more and more each day, a heart, chosen by virtue as her temple, and an understanding improved by the most refined attainments. She no longer remained my servant, but became my friend; and, by her own desire, has ever since resided here.— (Curtsying.) —Brother, I have done.
Bar. Too little to satisfy my curiosity; yet enough to make me realize my project. Sister, lend me your aid—I would marry her.
Countess. You!
Bar. I.
Countess. Baron Steinfort!
Bar. For shame! If I understand you!
Countess. Not so harsh, and not so hasty! Those great sentiments of contempt of inequality in rank are very fine in
[Page 39]
a romance: but we happen not to be inhabitants of an [225]   ideal world. How could you introduce her to the circle we live in? You surely would not attempt to present her to—
Bar. Object as you will—my answer is— I love . Sister, you see a man before you, who—
Countess. Who wants a wife.
Bar. No; who has deliberately poised advantage against disadvantage; domestic ease and comfort against the false gaieties of fashion. I can withdraw into the country. I need no honours to make my tenants happy, and my heart will teach me to make their happiness my own. With such a wife as this, children who resemble her, and fortune enough to spread comfort around me, what would the soul of man have more?
Countess. This is all vastly fine. I admire your plan; only you seem to have forgotten one trifling circumstance.
Bar. And that is?—
Countess. Whether Mrs. Haller will have you or not.
Bar. There, sister, I just want your assistance— (Seizing her hand.) —Good Henrietta!
Countess. Well, here's my hand. I'll do all I can for you. St!—We had near been overheard. They are coming. Be patient and obedient.
Enter Count and Mrs. Haller , leaning on his arm. Count. Upon my word, Mrs. Haller, you are a nimble walker: I should be sorry to run a race with you.
Mrs. H. [250]   Custom, my Lord. You need only take the same walk every day for a month.
Count. Yes, if I wanted to resemble my greyhounds.— But what said the Stranger?
Countess. He gave Charlotte a flat refusal; and you see his door, and even his shutters, are closed against us.

[Page 40]
Count. What an unaccountable being! But it won't do. I must shew my gratitude one way or other. Steinfort, we will take the ladies home, and then you shall try once again to see him. You can talk to these oddities better than I can.
Bar. If you wish it, with all my heart.
Count. Thank you; thank you. Come, ladies; come, Mrs. Haller.
                                         [Exeunt. SCENE II. A close Walk in the Garden. Enter Countess and Mrs. Haller . Countess. Well, Mrs. Haller! How do you like the man that just now left us?
Mrs. H. Who?
Countess. My brother.
Mrs. H. He deserves to be your brother.
Countess. —(Curtsying.) —Your most obedient! That shall be written in my pocket-book.
Mrs. H. Without flattery then, Madam, he appears to be most amiable.
Countess. Good!—And a handsome man?
Mrs. H. —(With indifference.) —Oh, yes!
Countess. “Oh, yes!” It sounded almost like, “Oh, no!” But I must tell you, that he looks upon you to be a handsome woman.— (Mrs. H. smiles.) —You make no reply to this?
Mrs. H. What shall I reply? Derision never fell from your lips; and I am little calculated to support it.
Countess. As little as you are calculated to be the cause of it. No, I was in earnest.—Now?

[Page 41]
Mrs. H. You confuse me!—But why should I play the prude? I will own there was a time when I thought myself handsome. 'Tis past. Alas! the enchanting beauties of a female countenance arise from peace of mind—The look which captivates an honourable man [25]   must be reflected from a noble soul.
Countess. Then heav'n grant my bosom may ever hold as pure a heart, as now those eyes bear witness lives in your's!
Mrs. H. —(With sudden wildness.) —Oh! Heav'n forbid!
Countess. —(Astonished.) —How!
Mrs. H. —(Checking her tears.) —Spare me! I am a wretch: The sufferings of three years can give me no claim to your friendship—No, not even to your compassion. Oh! spare me!— (Going.)
Countess. Stay, Mrs. Haller. For the first time, I beg your confidence.—My brother loves you.
Mrs. H. —(Starting, and gazing full in the face of the Countess.) —For mirth, too much—for earnest, too mournful!
Countess. I revere that modest blush. Discover to me who you are. You risk nothing. Pour all your griefs into a sister's bosom. Am I not kind? and can I not be silent?
Mrs. H. Alas! But a frank reliance on a generous mind is the greatest sacrifice to be offer'd by true repentance. This sacrifice I will offer.— (Hesitating.) —Did you never hear—Pardon me—Did you never hear— Oh! how shocking is it to unmask a deception, which alone has recommended me to your regard! But, it must be so.—Madam—Fie, Adelaide! does pride become you? [50]   Did you never hear of the Countess Waldbourg?
Countess. I think I did hear at the neighbouring court of such a creature. She plunged an honourable husband into misery. She ran away with a villain.

[Page 42]
Mrs. H. She did indeed.— (Falls at the feet of the Countess.) —Do not cast me from you.
Countess. For Heaven's sake! You are—
Mrs. H. I am that wretch.
Countess. —(Turning from her with horror.) —Ha!—Begone! — (Going. Her heart draws her back.) —Yet, she is unfortunate: she is unfriended! Her image is repentance— Her life the proof—She has wept her fault in three years agony. Be still awhile, remorseless prejudice, and let the genuine feelings of my soul avow—They do not truly honour virtue, who can insult the erring heart that would return to her sanctuary.— (Looking with sorrow on her.) Rise! I beseech you, rise! My husband and my brother may surprize us. I promise to be silent.— (Raising her.)
Mrs. H. Yes, you will be silent—But, oh! Conscience! Conscience! Thou never wilt be silent.— (Clasping her hand.) —Do not cast me from you.
Countess. Never! Your lonely life, your silent anguish and contrition, may at length atone your crime. And never shall you want an asylum, where your penitence may lament your loss.
Mrs. H. [75]   Yes, I have lost him. But—I had children too.
Countess. Enough! Enough!
Mrs. H. Oh! Madam—I would only know whether they are alive or dead! That, for a mother, is not much.
Countess. Compose yourself.
Mrs. H. Oh! had you known my husband, when I first beheld him! I was then scarcely sixteen years of age.
Countess. And your marriage?
Mrs. H. A few months after.
Countess. And your flight?
Mrs. H. I lived three years with him.

[Page 43]
Countess. Oh! my friend! your crime was youth and inexperience: your heart never was, never could be concerned in it.
Mrs. H. Oh! spare me! My conscience never martyrs me so horribly, as when I catch my base thoughts in search of an excuse! No, nothing can palliate my guilt; and the only just consolation left me, is, to acquit the man I wronged, and own I erred without a cause of fair complaint.
Countess. And this is the mark of true repentance. Alas! my friend, when superior sense, recommended too by superior charms of person, assail a young, though [100]   wedded—
Mrs. H. Ah! not even that mean excuse is left me. In all that merits admiration, respect, and love, he was far, far beneath my husband. But to attempt to account for my infatuation—I cannot bear it. 'Tis true, I thought my husband's manner grew colder to me—I knew that his expences, and his confidence in deceitful friends, had embarrassed his means, and clouded his spirits; yet I thought he denied me pleasures and amusements still within our reach. My vanity was mortified! My confidence not courted. The serpent tongue of my seducer promised every thing. But never could such arguments avail, till, assisted by forged letters, and the treachery of a servant, whom I most confided in, he fixed my belief that my Lord was false, and that all the coldness I complained of was disgust to me, and love for another; all his home retrenchments but the means of satisfying a rival's luxury. Madden'd with this conviction, (conviction it was, for artifice was most ingenious in its proof,) I left my children—father—husband—to follow—a villain.
Countess. But with such a heart, my friend could not remain long in her delusion?

[Page 44]
Mrs. H. Long enough to make sufficient penitence impossible. 'Tis true, that in a few weeks the delirium [125]   was at an end. Oh! what were my sensations when the mist dispersed before my eyes! I called for my husband, but in vain!—I listened for the prattle of my children, but in vain!
Countess. Check the recollection! I guess the end— You left your seducer?
Mrs. H. I did: and fled to you: To you, who have given me a spot where I might weep; and who will give me a spot where I may die.
Countess. —(Embracing her.) —Here, here, on this bosom only shall your future tears be shed: and may I, dear sufferer, make you again familiar with hope!
Mrs. H. Oh! impossible!
Countess. Have you never heard of your children?
Mrs. H. Never!
Countess. We must endeavour to gain some account of them. We must—Hold! my husband and my brother! Oh, my poor brother! I had quite forgotten him. Quick, dear Mrs. Haller, wipe your eyes. Let us meet them.
Mrs. H. Madam, I'll follow. Allow me a moment to compose myself.— (Exit Countess.) —I pause! Oh! yes —to compose myself!— (Ironically.) —She little thinks it is but to gain one solitary moment to vent my soul's remorse. Once the purpose of my unsettled mind was self-destruction; heaven knows how I have sued for [150]   hope and resignation. I did trust my prayers were heard—Oh! spare me further trial! I feel, I feel, my heart and brain can bear no more.
                                         [Exit.

END OF ACT III.

[Page 45]
ACT IV. SCENE I. The Skirts of the Park, Lodge, &c. as before. A Table spread with Fruits, &c. Francis discover'd placing the Supper. Fra. I know he loves to have his early supper in the fresh air: and, while he sups, not that I believe any thing can amuse him, yet I will try my little Savoyards' pretty voices. I have heard him speak as if he had loved music.— (Music without.) —Oh, here they are.
Enter Annette and Savoyard , playing.
1.
2 To welcome mirth and harmless glee,
We rambling minstrels, blythe and free,
With song the laughing hours beguile,
And wear a never-fading smile:
   Where'er we roam
   We find a home,
And greeting, to reward our toil.
2.
We sing of love, its hopes and fears;
Of perjur'd swains, and damsels' tears;
Of eyes that speak the heart's warm glow;
Of sighs that tell the bosom's woe.
   O'er hills and plains
   We breath our strains,
Thro' summer's heat, and winter's snow.
[Page 46]

3.
No anxious griefs disturb our rest,
Nor busy cares annoy our breast;
Fearless we sink in soft repose,
While night her sable mantle throws.
   With grateful lay,
[25]      Hail rising day,
That rosy health and peace bestows. During the duet, Stranger looks from the lodge window, and at the conclusion he comes out. Stra. What mummery is this?
Fra. I hoped it might amuse you, Sir.
Stra. Amuse me —fool!
Fra. Well then, I wished to amuse myself a little. I don't think my recreations are so very numerous.
Stra. That's true, my poor fellow; indeed they are not. Let them go on.— (Sits.) —I'll listen.
Fra. But to please you, poor master, I fear it must be a sadder strain. Annette, have you none but these chearful songs?
Ann. O plenty. If you are dolefully given, we can be as sad as night. I'll sing you an air Mrs. Haller taught me the first year she came to the castle.

1.
3 I have a silent sorrow here,
   A grief I'll ne'er impart;
It breathes no sigh, it sheds no tear,
   But it consumes my heart!
[Page 47]

This cherish'd woe, this lov'd despair,
   My lot for ever be;
So, my soul's lord, the pangs I bear
   Be never known by thee!
2.
And when pale characters of death
   Shall mark this alter'd cheek;
[50]   When my poor wasted trembling breath
   My life's last hope would speak;
I shall not raise my eyes to heav'n,
   Nor mercy ask for me;
My soul despairs to be forgiv'n,
   Unpardon'd, love, by thee. Stra. —(Surprized and moved.) —Oh! I have heard that air before, but 'twas with other words. Francis, share our supper with your friends—I need none.— (Enters the Lodge.)
Fra. So I feared. Well, my pretty favourite, here are refreshments. So, disturbed again. Now will this gentleman call for more music, and make my master mad. Return when you observe this man is gone.                                          [Exeunt Savoyards. (Francis sits and eats.) —I was in hopes that I might at least eat my supper peaceably in the open air; but they follow at out heels like blood-hounds.
Enter Baron . Bar. My good friend, I must speak to your master.
Fra. Can't serve you.
Bar. Why not?
Fra. Its forbidden.
Bar. —(Offers money.) —There! announce me.

[Page 48]
Fra. Want no money.
Bar. Well, only announce me then.
Fra. I will announce you, Sir; but it won't avail! I shall be abused, and you rejected. However, we can [75]   but try.— (Going.)
Bar. I only ask half a minute.— (Francis goes into the Lodge.) —But when he comes, how am I to treat him? I never encountered a misanthrope before. I have heard of instructions as to conduct in society; but how I am to behave towards a being who lothes the whole world, and his own existence, I have never learned.
Enter Stranger . Stra. Now; what's your will?
Bar. I beg pardon, Sir, for— (suddenly recognizing him) —Charles?
Stra. Steinfort!— (They embrace.)
Bar. Is it really you, my dear friend?
Stra. It is.
Bar. Merciful heavens! How are you alter'd!
Stra. The hand of misery lies heavy on me.—But how came you here? What want you?
Bar. Strange!—Here was I ruminating how to address this mysterious recluse: he appears, and proves to be my old and dearest friend.
Stra. Then you were not sent in search of me, nor knew that I lived here?
Bar. As little as I know who lives on the summit of Caucasus. You this morning saved the life of my brother-in--law's son: a grateful family wishes to behold you in its circle. You refused my sister's messenger; therefore, [100]   to give more weight to the invitation, I was deputed to be the bearer of it. And thus has fortune restored to me a friend, whom my heart has so long missed, and whom my heart just now so much requires.

[Page 49]
Stra. Yes, I am your friend; your sincere friend. You are a true man; an uncommon man. Towards you my heart is still the same. But, if this assurance be of any value to you—go—leave me—and return no more.
Bar. Stay! all that I see and hear of you is inexplicable. 'Tis you; but these, alas! are not the features which once enchanted every female bosom, beam'd gaiety through all society, and won you friends before your lips were opened! Why do you avert your face? Is the sight of a friend become hateful? Or, do you fear that I should read in your eye what passes in your soul? Where is that open look of fire, which at once penetrated into every heart, and reveal'd your own?
Stra. —(With asperity.) —My look penetrate into every heart.—Ha! ha! ha!
Bar. Oh, heavens! Rather may I never hear you laugh, than in such a tone!—Charles! what has happened to you?
Stra. Things that happen every day; occurrences heard of in every street. Steinfort, if I am not to hate you, ask me not another question. If I am to love you, [125]   leave me.
Bar. Oh, Charles! awake the faded ideas of past joys. Feel that a friend is near. Recollect the days we pass'd in Hungary, when we wandered arm-in-arm upon the banks of the Danube, while nature opened our hearts, and made us enamoured of benevolence and friendship. In those blessed moments, you gave me this seal as a pledge of your regard. Do you remember it?
Stra. Yes!
Bar. Am I since that time become less worthy of your confidence?
Stra. No!
Bar. Charles! It grieves me that I am thus compelled to enforce my rights upon you. Do you know this scar?

[Page 50]
Stra. Comrade! Friend! It received and resisted the stroke aimed at my life. I have not forgotten it. Alas! You knew not what a wretched present you then made me.
Bar. Speak then, I beseech you.
Stra. You cannot help me.
Bar. Then I can mourn with you.
Stra. That I hate. Besides, I cannot weep.
Bar. Then give me words instead of tears. Both relieve the heart.
Stra. My heart is like a close-shut sepulchre. Let what is within it moulder and decay—Why open the [150]   wretched charnel-house to spread a pestilence around?
Bar. How horrid are your looks! For shame! A man like you thus to crouch beneath the chance of fortune!
Stra. Steinfort! I did think the opinion of all mankind was alike indifferent to me; but I feel that it is not so. My friend, you shall not quit me without learning how I have been robbed of every joy which life afforded. Listen: much misery may be contained in few words. Attracted by my native country, I quitted you and the service. What pleasing pictures did I draw of a life employed in improving society, and diffusing happiness! I fixed on Cassel to be my abode. All went on admirably. I found friends. At length, too, I found a wife; a lovely, innocent creature, scarce sixteen years of age. Oh! how I loved her! She bore me a son and a daughter. Both where endowed by nature with the beauty of their mother. Ask me not how I loved my wife and children! Yes, then I was really happy.— (Wiping his eyes.) —Ha! a tear! I could not have believed it. Welcome, my friends! 'Tis long since we have known each other. Well, my story is nearly ended. One of my friends, for whom I became engaged, treacherously lost me more than half my fortune. This hurt me. I was obliged to retrench my expences. Contentment needs but little.
[Page 51]
I forgave him. Another friend—a villain! to whom I [175]   was attached heart and soul; whom I had assisted with my means, and promoted by my interest; this fiend! seduced my wife, and bore her from me. Tell me, Sir, is this enough to justify my hatred of mankind, and palliate my seclusion from the world?—Kings—laws— tyranny—or guilt—can but imprison me, or kill me. But, O God! O God! Oh! what are chains or death, compared to the tortures of a deceived yet doting husband!
Bar. To lament the loss of a faithless wife is madness.
Stra. Call it what you please—say what you please—I love her still.
Bar. And where is she?
Stra. I know not, nor do I wish to know.
Bar. And your children?
Stra. I left them at a small town hard-by.
Bar. But why did you not keep your children with you? They would have amused you in many a dreary hour.
Stra. Amused! Oh, yes! while their likeness to their mother would every hour remind me of my past happiness! No. For three years I have never seen them. I hate that any human creature should be near me, young or old! Had not ridiculous habits made a servant necessary, I should long since have discharged him; though [200]   he is not the worst among the bad.
Bar. Such too often is the consequences of great alliances. Therefore, Charles, I have resolved to take a wife from a lower rank of life.
Stra. You marry!—Ha! ha! ha!
Bar. You shall see her. She is in the house where you are expected. Come with me.
Stra. What! I mix again with the world?

[Page 52]
Bar. To do a generous action, without requiring thanks, is noble and praise-worthy. But, so obstinately to avoid those thanks, as to make the kindness a burthen, is affectation.
Stra. Leave me! leave me! Every one tries to form a circle, of which he may be the centre. As long as there remains a bird in these woods to greet the rising sun with its melody, I shall court no other society.
Bar. Do as you please to-morrow; but give me your company this evening.
Stra. —(Resolutely.) —No!
Bar. Not though it were in your power, by this single visit, to secure the happiness of your friend for life?
Stra. —(Starting.) —Ha! then I must—But how?—
Bar. You shall sue in my behalf to Mrs. Haller—You have the talent of persuasion.
Stra. I! my dear Steinfort!
Bar. [225]   The happiness or misery of your friend depends upon it. I'll contrive that you shall speak to her alone. Will you?
Stra. These are pretences. But I'll come, however, on one condition.
Bar. Name it.
Stra. That you allow me to begone to-morrow, without endeavouring to detain me.
Bar. Go! Whither?
Stra. No matter! Promise this, or I will not come.
Bar. Well, I do promise.
Stra. I have directions to give my servant.
Bar. In half an hour then we shall expect you. Remember, you have given your word.
Stra. I have.                                          [Exit Baron. (Walks up and down thoughtful and melancholy.)— Francis!

[Page 53]
Enter Francis . Fra. Sir!
Stra. I shall leave this place to-morrow.
Fra. With all my heart.
Stra. Perhaps to go into another land.
Fra. With all my heart again!
Stra. Perhaps into another quarter of the globe.
Fra. With all my heart still. Into which quarter?
Stra. Wherever heaven directs! Away! Away! from Europe! From this cultivated moral lazaret! Do you [250]   hear, Francis? To-morrow early.
Fra. Very well.
Stra. But first I have an errand for you. Hire that carriage in the village; drive to the town hard-by; you may be back by sun-set. I shall give you a letter to a widow who lives there. With her you will find two children. They are mine.
Fra. —(Astonished.) —Your children, Sir!
Stra. Take them, and bring them hither.
Fra. Your children, Sir!
Stra. Yes, mine! Is it so very inconceivable?
Fra. That I should have been three years in your service, and never have heard them mentioned, is somewhat strange.
Stra. Pshaw!
Fra. You have been married then?
Stra. Go, and prepare for our journey.
Fra. That I can do in five minutes.
                                         [Exit. Stra. I shall come and write the letter directly. Yes, I'll take them with me. I'll accustom myself to the sight of them. The innocents! they shall not be poisoned by the refinements of society. Rather let them hunt their daily sustenance upon some desart island with their bow and arrow; or creep like torpid Hottentots
[Page 54]
into a corner, and stare at each other. Better to do nothing [275]   than to do evil. Fool that I was, to be prevailed upon once more to exhibit myself among these apes! What a ridiculous figure shall I be, and in the capacity of a suitor too! Phsa! he cannot be serious! 'Tis but a friendly artifice to draw me from my solitude. Why did I promise him? Well, my sufferings have been many, and, to oblige a friend, why should I not add another painful hour to the wretched calendar of my life? I'll go. I'll go.
                                         [Exit. SCENE II. The Antichamber. Enter Charlotte . Char. No, indeed, my lady! If you chuse to bury yourself in the country, I shall take my leave. I am not calculated for a country life. And, to sum up all, when I think of this Mrs. Haller—
Enter Solomon . Sol. —(Overhearing her last words.) —What of Mrs. Haller, my sweet Miss?
Char. Why, Mr. Solomon, who is Mrs. Haller? You know every thing; you hear every thing.
Sol. I have received no letters from any part of Europe on the subject, Miss.
Char. But who is to blame? The Count and Countess. She dines with them, and, at this very moment, is drinking tea with them. Is this proper?
Sol. By no means.
Char. Shouldn't a Count, in all his actions, shew a certain degree of pride and pomposity?

[Page 55]
Sol. To be sure! To be sure he should!
Char. No, I won't submit to it. I'll tell her ladyship, when I dress her to-morrow, that either Mrs. Haller, or I, must quit the house.
Sol. —(Seeing the Baron.) —St!
Enter Baron . Bar. Didn't I hear Mrs. Haller's name here?
Sol. —(Confused.) —Why—yes—we—we—
Bar. Charlotte, tell my sister I wish to see her as soon [25]   as the tea-table is removed.
Char. —(Aside to Sol.) —Either she or I go, that I'm determined.
                                         [Exit. Bar. May I ask what it was you were saying?
Sol. Why, please your honourable Lordship, we were talking here and there—this and that—
Bar. I almost begin to suspect some secret.
Sol. Secret! Heaven forbid! Mercy on us! No! I should have had letters on the subject, if there had been a secret.
Bar. Well then, since it was no secret, I presume I may know your conversation.
Sol. You do us great honour, my lord. Why then, at first, we were making a few common-place observations. Miss Charlotte remarked that we all had our faults. I said, “Yes.” Soon after I remarked that the best persons in the world were not without their weaknesses. She said, “Yes.”
Bar. If you referred to Mrs. Haller's faults and weaknesses, I am desirous to hear more.
Sol. Sure enough, Sir, Mrs. Haller is an excellent woman; but she's not an angel, for all that. I am an old faithful servant to his Excellency the Count, and therefore it is my duty to speak, when any thing is done disadvantageous to his interest.

[Page 56]
Bar. [50]   Well!
Sol. For instance, now; his Excellency may think he has, at least, some score of dozens of the old six-and-twenty hock. Mercy on us! there are not ten dozen bottles left; and not a drop has gone down my throat, I'll swear.
Bar. —(Smiling.) —Mrs. Haller has not drank it, I suppose?
Sol. Not she herself, for she never drinks wine. But if any body be ill in the village, any poor woman lying-in, that might think herself well off with common Rhenish, away goes a bottle of the six-and-twenty! Innumerable are the times that I've reproved her; but she always answers me snappishly, that she will be responsible for it.
Bar. So will I, Mr. Solomon.
Sol. Oh! with all my heart, your honourable Lordship. It makes no difference to me. I had the care of the cellar twenty years, and can safely take my oath, that I never gave the poor a single drop in the whole course of my trust.
Bar. How extraordinary is this woman!
Sol. Extraordinary! One can make nothing of her. To-day, the vicar's wife is not good enough for her. Tomorrow, you may see her sitting with all the women of the village. To be sure she and I agree pretty well; [75]   for, between me and your honourable Lordship, she has cast an eye upon my son Peter.
Bar. Has she?
Sol. Yes—Peter's no fool, I assure you. The schoolmaster is teaching him to write. Would your honourable Lordship please to see a specimen? I'll go for his copy-book. He makes his pot-hooks capitally.
Bar. Another time, another time. Good bye, for the present, Mr. Solomon.— (Solomon bows without attempting to go.) —Good day, Mr. Solomon!

[Page 57]
Sol. —(Not understanding the hint.) —Your honourable Lordship's most obedient servant.
Bar. This is too bad. Mr. Solomon, I wish to be alone.
Sol. As your Lordship commands. If the time should seem long in my absence, and your Lordship wishes to hear the newest news from the feat of war, you need only send for old Solomon. I have letters from Leghorn, Cape Horn, and every known part of the habitable globe.
                                         [Exit. Bar. Tedious old fool! Yet hold. Did he not speak in praise of Mrs. Haller? Pardoned be his rage for news and politics. Enter Countess . Well, sister, have you spoken to her?
Countess. I have: and if you do not steer for another haven, you will be doomed to drive upon the ocean for [100]   ever.
Bar. Is she married?
Countess. I don't know.
Bar. Is she of a good family?
Countess. I can't tell.
Bar. Does she dislike me?
Countess. Excuse my making a reply.
Bar. I thank you for your sisterly affection, and the explicitness of your communications. Luckily I placed little reliance on either; and have found a friend who will save your Ladyship all further trouble.
Countess. A friend!
Bar. Yes. The Stranger who saved your son's life this morning, proves to be my intimate friend.
Countess. What's his name?
Bar. I don't know.
Countess. Is he of a good family?

[Page 58]
Bar. I can't tell.
Countess. Will he come hither?
Bar. Excuse my making a reply.
Countess. Well, the retort is fair—but insufferable.
Bar. You can't object to the Da Capo of your own composition.
Enter Count and Mrs. Haller . Count. Zounds! do you think I am Xenocrates; or, like the poor Sultan with marble legs? There you leave [125]   me tête-a-tête with Mrs. Haller, as if my heart were a mere flint. So, you prevailed, brother. The Stranger will come then, it seems.
Bar. I expect him every minute.
Countess. I'm glad to hear it. One companion more, however. In the country we never can have too many.
Bar. This gentleman will not exactly be an addition to your circle, for he leaves this place to-morrow.
Count. But he won't, I think. Now, Lady Wintersen, summon all your charms. There is no art in conquering us poor devils; but, this strange man, who does not care a doit for you altogether, is worth your efforts. Try your skill. I sha'n't be jealous.
Countess. I allow the conquest to be worth the trouble. But, what Mrs. Haller has not been able to effect in three months, ought not to be attempted by me.
Mrs. H. —(Jocosely.) —O yes, Madam. He has given me no opportunity of trying the force of my charms, for I have never once happened to see him.
Count. Then he's a blockhead; and you, an idler.
Solomon. —(Without.) —This way, Sir! This way!

[Page 59]
Enter Solomon . Sol. The Stranger begs leave to have the honour—
Count. Welcome! welcome! Shew him the way.                                          [Exit Solomon. [Turns to meet the Stranger, whom he conducts in by the hand.] My dear Sir—Lady Wintersen—Mrs. Haller—
[Mrs. Haller, as soon as she sees the Stranger, shrieks, and swoons in the arms of the Baron and Countess. The Stranger casts a look at her, and, struck with astonishment and horror, rushes out of the room. The Baron and Countess bear Mrs. Haller off. Count following in great surprize.]

END OF ACT IV.

[Page 60]
ACT V. SCENE I. The Antichamber. Enter Baron . Bar. Oh! deceitful hope! Thou phantom of future happiness! To thee have I stretched out my arms, and thou hast vanished into air! Wretched Steinfort! The mystery is solved. She is the wife of my friend! Enough! Not by idle disputation, but by deeds, will I contradict what Wintersen just now asserted. I cannot myself be happy: but, I may, perhaps, be able to re-unite two lovely souls, whom cruel fate has severed. Ha! they are here. I must propose it instantly.
Enter Countess and Mrs. Haller . Countess. Into the garden, my dear friend! Into the air!
Mrs. H. I am quite well. Do not alarm yourselves on my account.
Bar. Madam, pardon my intrusion; but to lose a moment may be fatal. He means to quit the country tomorrow. We must devise means to reconcile you to— the Stranger.
Mrs. H. How, my Lord! You seem acquainted with my history?
Bar. I am. Waldbourg has been my friend ever since we were boys. We served together from the rank of cadet. We have been separated seven years. Chance brought us this day together, and his heart was open to me.
Mrs. H. [25]   Now do I feel what it is to be in the presence of an honest man, when I dare not meet his eye.— (Hides her face.)

[Page 61]
Bar. If sincere repentance, if years without reproach, do not give us a title to man's forgiveness, what must we expect hereafter? No, lovely penitent! your contrition is complete. Error, for a moment, wrested from slumbering virtue the dominion of your heart; but she awoke, and, with a look, banished her enemy for ever. I know my friend. He has the firmness of a man; but, with it, the gentlest feelings of your sex. I hasten to him. With the fire of pure disinterested friendship will I enter on this work; that, when I look back upon my past life, I may derive from this good action, consolation in disappointment, and even resignation in despair.— (Going.)
Mrs. H. Oh, stay! What would you do? No! never! My husband's honour is sacred to me. I love him unutterably: but never, never can I be his wife again; even if he were generous enough to pardon me.
Bar. Madam! Can you, Countess, be serious?
Mrs. H. Not that title, I beseech you! I am not a child who wishes to avoid deserved punishment. What were my penitence, if I hoped advantage from it, beyond the consciousness of atonement for past offence!
Countess. But if your husband himself—?
Mrs. H. Oh! he will not! he cannot! And let him [50]   rest assured I never would replace my honour at the expence of his.
Bar. He still loves you.
Mrs. H. Loves me! Then he must not—No—he must purify his heart from a weakness which would degrade him.
Bar. Incomparable woman! I go to my friend—perhaps, for the last time. Have you not one word to send him?
Mrs. H. Yes, I have two requests to make. Often, when, in excess of grief, I have despaired of every consolation, I have thought I should be easier, if I might
[Page 62]
behold my husband once again, acknowledge my injustice to him, and take a gentle leave of him for ever. This, therefore, is my first request—a conversation for a few short minutes, if he does not quite abhor the sight of me. My second request is—O—not to see, but, to hear some account of, my poor children.
Bar. If humanity and friendship can avail, he will not for a moment delay your wishes.
Countess. Heav'n be with you!
Mrs. H. And my prayers.
                                         [Exit Baron. Countess. Come, my friend, come into the air; till he returns with hope and consolation.
Mrs. H. O my heart! How art thou afflicted! My [75]   husband! My little ones! Past joys and future fears— Oh, dearest Madam! there are moments in which we live years! Moments, which steal the roses from the cheek of health, and plough deep furrows in the brow of youth.
Countess. Banish these sad reflections. Come; let us walk. The sun will set soon; let nature's beauties dissipate anxiety.
Mrs. H. Alas! Yes, the setting sun is a proper scene for me.
Countess. Never forget a morning will succeed.
                                         [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Skirts of the Park, Lodge, &c. as before. Enter Baron . Bar. On earth there is but one such pair. They shall not be parted. Yet what I have undertaken is not so easy as I at first hoped. What can I answer, when he
[Page 63]
asks me, whether I would persuade him to renounce his character, and become the derision of society? For he is right. A faithless wife is a dishonour; and to forgive her, is to share her shame. What though Adelaide may be an exception; a young deluded girl, who has so long, and so sincerely repented: yet what cares an unfeeling world for this? The world! he has quitted it. 'Tis evident he loves her still; and upon this assurance builds my sanguine heart the hope of a happy termination to an honest enterprize.
Enter Francis , with two children, William and Amelia . Fra. Come along, my pretty ones—come
Will. Is it far to home?
Fra. No, we shall be there directly, now.
Bar. Hold! Whose children are these?
Fra. My master's.
Will. Is that my father?
Bar. It darts like light'ning through my brain! A word with you. I know you love your master. Strange things have happened here. Your master has found his wife again.
Fra. Indeed! Glad to hear it.
Bar. [25]   Mrs. Haller—
Fra. Is she his wife? Still more glad to hear it.
Bar. But he is determined to go from her.
Fra. Oh!
Bar. We must try to prevent it.
Fra. Surely.
Bar. The unexpected appearance of the children may perhaps assist us.
Fra. How so?

[Page 64]
Bar. Hide yourself with them in that hut. Before a quarter of an hour is past you shall know more.
Fra. But—
Bar. No more questions, I entreat you. Time is precious.
Fra. Well, well; questions are not much in my way. Come, children.
Will. Why, I thought you told me I should see my father.
Fra. So you shall, my dear. Come, moppets.
                                         [Goes into the hut with children. Bar. Excellent! I promise myself much from this little artifice. If the mild look of the mother fails, the innocent smiles of these his own children, will surely find the way to his heart.— (Taps at the lodge door. Stranger comes out.) —Charles, I wish you joy.
Stra. Of what?
Bar. You have found her again.
Stra. [50]   Shew a bankrupt the treasure which he once possessed, and then congratulate him on the amount!
Bar. Why not, if it be in your power to retrieve the whole?
Stra. I understand you: you are a negociator from my wife. It won't avail.
Bar. Learn to know your wife better. Yes, I am a messenger from her; but without power to treat. She, who loves you unutterably, who, without you, never can be happy, renounces your forgiveness, because, as she thinks, your honour is incompatible with such a weakness.
Stra. Pshaw! I am not to be caught.
Bar. Charles! consider well—
Stra. Steinfort, let me explain all this. I have lived here four months. Adelaide knew it.
Bar. Knew it! She never saw you 'till to-day.

[Page 65]
Stra. That she may make fools believe. Hear further: she knows too that I am not a common sort of man; that my heart is not to be attacked in the usual way. She, therefore, framed a nice, deep-concerted plan. She played a charitable part; but in such a way that it always reached my ears. She played a pious, modest, reserved part, in order to excite my curiosity. And at last to-day she plays the prude. She refuses my forgiveness, [75]   in order, by this generous device, to extort it from my compassion.
Bar. Charles! I have listened to you with astonishment. This is weakness only to be pardoned in a man who has so often been deceived by the world. Your wife has expressly and stedfastly declared, that she will not accept your forgiveness, even if you yourself were weak enough to offer it.
Stra. What then has brought you hither?
Bar. More than one reason. First, I am come in my own name, as your friend and comrade, to conjure you solemnly, not to spurn this creature from you; for, by my soul, you will not find her equal.
Stra. Give yourself no further trouble.
Bar. Be candid, Charles. You love her still?
Stra. Alas! yes.
Bar. Her sincere repentance has long since obliterated her crime.
Stra. Sir! a wife, once induced to forfeit her honour, must be capable of a second crime.
Bar. Not so, Charles. Ask your own heart, what portion of the blame may be your own.
Stra. Mine!
Bar. Your's. Who told you to marry a thoughtless, inexperienced girl? One scarce expects established principles [100]   at five-and-twenty in a man, yet you require them in a girl of sixteen! But of this no more. She has erred;
[Page 66]
she has repented; and, during three years, her conduct has been so far above reproach, that even the piercing eye of Calumny has not discover'd a speck upon this radiant orb.
Stra. Now, were I to believe all this—for I confess I would willingly believe it—yet can she never again be mine.— (With extreme asperity.) —Oh! what a feast would it be for the painted dolls, when I appeared among them, with my runaway wife upon my arm! What mocking, whispering, and pointing!—Never! never! never!
Bar. Enough! As a friend I have done my duty. I now appear as Adelaide's ambassador. She requests one moment's conversation: she wishes once again to see you, and never more! You cannot deny her this only, this last request.
Stra. Oh! I understand this too. She thinks my firmness will be melted by her tears. She is mistaken. She may come.
Bar. She will come to make you feel how much you mistake her. I go for her.
Stra. Another word. Give her this paper, and these jewels. They belong to her.— (Presenting them.)
Bar. That you may do yourself.
                                         [Exit. Stra. [125]   The last anxious moment of my life draws near. I shall see her once again; see her on whom my soul doats. Is this the language of an injured husband? Alas! alas! What is the principle which we call honour? Is it a feeling of the heart, or a mere quibble in the brain? I must be resolute: it cannot now be otherwise. Let me speak solemnly, yet mildly; and beware that nothing of reproach escape my lips. Yes, her penitence is real. She shall not be obliged to live in mean dependance: she shall be mistress of herself, and have enough to— (Looks round, and shudders.) —Ha! they come. Awake, insulted pride! Protect me, injured honour!

[Page 67]
Enter Mrs. Haller , Countess and Baron . Mrs. H. —(Advances slowly, and in a tremor. Countess attempts to support her.) —Leave me now, I beseech you. (Approaches Stranger, who, with averted countenance, and in extreme agitation, awaits her address.) —My Lord!
Stra. —(With gentle tremulous utterance, and face still turned away.) —What would you with me, Adelaide?
Mrs. H. —(Much agitated.) —No—for heaven's sake! I was not prepared for this. Oh! that tone cuts to my heart. Adelaide! No. For heaven's sake. Harsh tones alone are suited to a culprit's car.
Stra. —(Endeavouring to give his voice firmness.) — Well, Madam!
Mrs. H. Oh! if you will ease my heart, if you will spare and pity me, use reproaches.
Stra. Reproaches! Here they are upon my fallow [150]   cheek—here in my hollow eye—here in my faded form. These reproaches I could not spare you.
Mrs. H. Were I a hardened sinner, this forbearance would be charity: but I am a suffering penitent, and it overpowers me. Alas! then I must be the herald of my own shame. For, where shall I find peace, till I have eased my soul by my confession?
Stra. No confession, Madam. I release you from every humiliation. I perceive you feel that we must part for ever.
Mrs. H. I know it. Nor come I here to supplicate your pardon; nor has my heart contained a ray of hope that you would grant it. All I dare ask, is, that you will not curse my memory.

[Page 68]
Stra. —(Moved.) —No, Adelaide, I do not curse you. No, I shall never curse you.
Mrs. H. —(Agitated.) —From the inward conviction that I am unworthy of your name, I have, during three years, abandoned it. But this is not enough; you must have that redress which will enable you to chuse another —another wife, in whose untainted arms may heav'n protect your hours in bliss! This paper will be necessary for the purpose: it contains a written acknowledgment of my guilt.— (Offers it trembling.)
Stra. —(Tearing it.) —Perish the record for ever. No, [175]   Adelaide, you only have possessed my heart; and, without shame, I confess it, you alone will reign there for ever. Your own sensations of virtue, your resolute honour, forbid you to profit by my weakness; and even if—Now, by heaven, this is beneath a man! But—never —never will another fill Adelaide's place here.
Mrs. H. —(Trembling.) —Then nothing now remains but that one sad, hard, just word—farewell.
Stra. A moment stay. For some months we have, without knowing it, lived near each other. I have learnt much good of you. You have a heart open to the wants of your fellow creatures. I am happy that it is so. You shall not be without the power of gratifying your benevolence. I know you have a spirit that must shrink from a state of obligation. This paper, to which the whole remnant of my fortune is pledged, secures you independence, Adelaide: and let the only recommendation of the gift be, that it will administer to you the means of indulging in charity, the divine propensity of your nature.
Mrs. H. Never! By the labour of my hands must I earn my sustenance. A morsel of bread, moistened with the tear of penitence, will suffice my wishes, and exceed my merits. It would be an additional reproach to think
[Page 69]
that I served myself, or even others, from the bounty of [200]   him whom I had so basely injured.
Stra. Take it, Madam: take it.
Mrs. H. I have deserved this. But, I throw myself upon your generosity. Have compassion on me!
Stra. —(Aside.) —Villain! of what a woman hast thou robbed me!— (Puts up the paper.) —Well, Madam, I respect your sentiments, and withdraw my request; but on this one condition, that if you ever should be in want of any thing, I shall be the first and only person in the world to whom you will make application.
Mrs. H. I promise it, my Lord.
Stra. And now I may at least desire you to take back what is your own—your jewels.— (Gives her the casket.)
Mrs. H —(Opens it in violent agitation, and her tears burst upon it.) —How well do I recollect the sweet evening when you gave me these! That evening, my father joined our hands; and joyfully I pronounced the oath of eternal fidelity.—It is broken. This locket you gave me on my birth-day—'tis five years since. That was a happy day! We had a country feast—How cheerful we all were! This bracelet I received after my William was born! No! I cannot keep these, unless you wish that the sight of them should be an incessant reproach to my almost broken heart.— (Gives them back.)
Stra. —(Aside.) —I must go. My soul and pride will hold no longer.— (Turning towards her.) —Farewell!
Mrs. H. [225]   Oh! but one minute more! An answer to but one more question.—Feel for a mother's heart! Are my children still alive?
Stra. They are alive.
Mrs. H. And well?
Stra. They are well.
Mrs. H. God be praised! William must be much grown?

[Page 70]
Stra. I believe so.
Mrs. H. What! Have you not seen them!—And little Amelia, is she still your favourite?— (The Stranger, who is in violent agitation throughout this scene, remains in silent contention between honour and affection.) —Oh! if you knew how my heart has hung upon them for these three long dreadful years—how I have sat at evening twilight, first fancying William, then Amelia, on my lap!— Oh! allow me to behold them once again—let me once more kiss the features of their father in his babes, and I will kneel to you, and part with them for ever.
Stra. Willingly, Adelaide! This very night. I expect the children every minute. They have been brought up near this spot. I have already sent my servant for them. He might before this time have returned. I pledge my word to send them to the castle as soon as they arrive. There, if you please, they may remain 'till day-break to-morrow. Then they must go with me.— (A pause.)
[The Countess and Baron, who at a little distance have listened to the whole conversation with the warmest sympathy, exchange signals. Baron goes into the hut, and soon returns with Francis and the Children. He gives the Boy to the Countess, who places herself behind Mrs. Haller. He himself walks with the Girl behind the Stranger.] Mrs. H. [250]   In this world, then—we have no more to say. (Summoning all her resolution.) —Farewell!— (Seizing his hand.) —Forget a wretch, who never will forget you.— (Kneels.) —Let me press this hand once more to my lips—this hand, which once was mine.
Stra. —(Raising her.) —No humiliation, Adelaide!— (Shakes her hand.) —Farewell!
Mrs. H. A last farewell!
Stra. The last.

[Page 71]
Mrs. H. And when my penance shall have broken my heart, when we again meet, in a better world—
Stra. There, Adelaide, you may be mine again.
[Their hands lie in each other: their eyes mournfully meet each other: they stammer another “Farewell!” and part; but as they are going, she encounters the Boy, and he the Girl. Children. Dear father!—Dear mother!
[They press the children in their arms with speechless affection; then tear themselves away—gaze at each other —spread their arms, and rush into an embrace. The children run, and cling round their parents. The curtain falls.] Back matter

[Page 1]
Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A gallery in the palace at Braunaw . Enter Henry and Wolf , on opposite sides. Hen. Welcome , Wolf! what bring'st thou?
Wolf. Fraternal greeting from the Count Palatine to Henry, Count of Andechs.
Hen. Whence art thou come?
Wolf. From Wittelsbach.
Hen. Where is my brother?
Wolf. On his way hither.
Hen. Indeed! How long have you been in Bavaria?
Wolf. We arrived last night from the Emperor's court at our castle. By Heavens, my Lord, you will scarcely believe me, when I tell you we were only a week in riding from Aix to Wittelsbach. Hills and woods flew so rapidly past us, that we could scarcely see them.
Hen. Why in such haste?
Wolf. My Lord, I'll tell you as much as I know of the matter. Hearing nothing from my master on the road but
[Page 2]
“more speed, Wolf, more speed,” I once ventured to ask a question, my Lord. “Sir,” said I, “why in such haste?” “At Braunaw,” answered he, “I'll have my beard shorn, that I may please the women.” I perceived that he meant “Wolf, hold your tongue, and attend to your horse;”—so I asked no more questions.
Hen. To please the women at Braunaw! Hem!
Wolf. But, my Lord, what means all this bustle in the [25]   castle?
Hen. Know'st thou not that our Duke is to be married to day?
Wolf. Married! Not I. To whom?
Hen. To the widow of Count Albrecht of Bogen.
Wolf. What? Well, I shall now be surprised at nothing in the world. Why, she is a Bohemian.
Hen. She is young and handsome.
Wolf. (Shakes his head) Hem! Hem! I must see her. Farewell, my Lord.
Hen. Whither art thou going?
Wolf. Into the saloon to see the bride.
Hen. Thou wilt not be admitted.
Wolf. How! Not admitted!
Hen. None but a Knight dare enter the Duke's apartments unbidden.
Wolf. What! May not a Bavarian greet his Prince?
Hen. Stay here, Wolf. The procession will pass through this gallery to the church, and thou wilt have a better view of it.
Enter Two Citizens of Munich. First Cit. God be with you, noble Count!
Hen. Thanks, my friends! Whence come you?

[Page 3]
First Cit. We come from Munich to make an appeal in behalf of the citizens to our Duke.
Hen. How goes it in Munich?
First Cit. [50]   Thank Heaven, well. Since Albrecht of Bogen's followers and the Bohemians have ceased to molest us, we find good employment and subsistence. Would the whole empire were in as peaceful a state!
Wolf. It soon will be, good neighbour.
Sec. Cit. Ha! Wolf! Welcome home! Do you bring good news? Is the Count Palatine here too?
Wolf. He will soon be here.
Sec. Cit. (To the other) Otto is coming. He will certainly assist us.
Hen. Wolf, they approach. I must accompany the Duke to church. Should Otto arrive in the mean time, tell him his brother Henry rejoices in the hope of seeing him.
The procession appears. Fifty guards pass through the gallery, followed by many Knights and Nobles magnificently clothed. In the midst of them walks the Duke, supported by Egbert and another Peer. Henry joins them. After the Duke, walks the Duchess, supported by two ladies of rank, and followed by others. These are succeeded by more Knights and Nobles, and fifty guards close the procession. Duke. (As he passes) Is not that Wolf, the Squire of the Count Palatine?
Wolf. (Goes to him.) Your Highness is right.
Duke. (Stops.) What art thou doing here, without thy master?
Wolf. He sent me to prepare for his reception.
Duch. Why do they not proceed?
The ladies tell her that the Duke is in conversation with Wolf.
[Page 4]
Duke. My cousin Otto is coming to see me, then! I rejoice to hear it. But why did he send you? My Palace is always ready for his reception. Farewell, Wolf.
                                         [Proceeds. Duch. (As she passes.) His presence was not exactly necessary.
Manent Wolf , and the Two Citizens . Wolf. Why did you not make your appeal?
First Cit. [75]   We saw that the Duchess did not like to be detained.
Sec. Cit. She seemed angry because the Duke spoke to you.
Fist Cit. Well, we have lost nothing by the delay, for the Count Palatine arrives, our petition is as good as when granted. He will never suffer a Bavarian to be aggrieved. Trumpets are heard at a distance.
Wolf. Hark! Now they are in the church.
First Cit. Don't you think the Duchess handsome?
Sec. Cit. Yes, very handsome.
Wolf. True. In the whole procession, which seemed calculated for a display of magnificence and beauty, there was certainly nothing, which could be compared with her person, but that she was offended when the Duke spoke to me—Hem! A Duchess of Bavarian blood would not have been so.
First Cit. Well, well! She, perhaps, did not mean it amiss. —But, what news do you bring from the Emperor's court?
Wolf. None but good. Strasburg, Erfort and Aix are our's. Well may I say our's , for our Otto did most towards the conquest of them. Without him the Emperor Philip would but have been an arm without a sword, or a sword without an arm.

[Page 5]
First Cit. How it delights me to hear such tidings! Yes. The race of Wittelsbach is the glory of Bavaria. Long may [100]   it continue so!
Wolf. Thanks, countryman! Don't doubt it.
First Cit. The Emperor will surely reward the Count Palatine most royally.
Wolf. He will. Don't you know how?
First Cit. No.
Wolf. He will reward him with the hand of one of his daughters.
Sec. Cit. What say you?
Wolf. That Otto of Wittelsbach will soon be the Emperor's son-in-law.
First Cit. Heavens! How happy you make us! Come, Wolf, come with us, and let us drink to your brave master's health.
Wolf. I thank you, good men, but I must await his arrival here. I never in my life had it in my power to blame him for any thing, except that he is apt to forget his horse has no wings, and may at last be tired. But hark! 'Tis he. No one rides thus but Otto.
Enter Otto . First and Sec. Cit. Hail to the noble Count Palatine! Welcome, welcome to your native land!
Otto. Many thanks to you, dear Bavarians! Ha! Were not thou one of my followers, when I fought against Albrecht of Bogen?
Sec. Cit. I was, my Lord.
Otto. [125]   Why, you told me you meant to settle in Munich.
Sec. Cit. And did so, too, my Lord. We two are deputed by the Citizens to make an appeal to our gracious Duke. (To First Cit.) Speak.

[Page 6]
First Cit. My Lord, the city of Munich has received a command from the Emperor, which infringes on its rights.
Otto. The Emperor infringes on your rights, do you say? He is not apt to do that.
First Cit. It is his command that we shall pay an annual tribute of sixty-five silver marks, on account of the advantages we derive from the salt trade. This has never been done in the memory of man, and we therefore come to beg that our Duke would be graciously pleased to state it as a grievance in the Imperial courts.
Otto. If it be not customary and just, you shall not pay the sixty-five marks.
First Cit. It is not customary and just.
Otto. Then you shall pay nothing.
First Cit. We will tell the citizens that we must not pay the tribute.
Otto. Do so, and greet them in my name.
First Cit. We return you thanks, my noble Lord. Heaven bless you and your children, that we may always know where to apply for protection!
Otto. Farewell, my countrymen. At Wittelsbach I [150]   would regale you, but here—
First Cit. Oh, to have seen you is a greater treat than any banquet. God preserve you, noble Count!
                                         [Exeunt Citizens. Wolf. I delivered your greeting to the Count of Andechs, and every thing is ready for your reception at the palace.
Otto. Knew my brother I was coming?
Wolf. No. I thought he seemed surprised at it.
Otto. Where is he?
Wolf. In the church. Had you come a moment sooner, you would have seen the handsome couple, and the Nobles of the land pass through this gallery. The sight would have been worth the trouble, I assure you, sir.

[Page 7]
Otto. Think'st thou so, Wolf? No—we ought to have been more speedy—we ought to have been here a week ago.
Wolf. Merciful Heavens! We must have ridden on the wind, then. But why sooner? You are arrived in time for the celebration of the marriage.
Otto. That is exactly what I did not wish. Half my possessions would I give, had I not come to the celebration of this marriage. Wolf, hold yourself ever in readiness, as if we were at an inn.
Wolf. I will, my Lord. Dare I speak as I think?
Otto. On your life in no other way.
Wolf. Why, then, I think we seem to be at an inn, [175]   where the same attention is not paid as heretofore. When you used to come hither, old and young, great and small ran to greet you; but to-day not even a dog, belonging to the Duke, makes its appearance.
Otto. So much the better, Wolf. The Duke's dogs are idle dogs. They are fed to do nothing.
                                         [Trumpets are again heard. Wolf. I believe they are coming from church. Yes, see!
The procession returns in the same order as it went. The Duke, Henry, and Egbert step out to welcome Otto. The procession stops. Wolf goes. Duke. You are welcome, dear kinsman. I rejoice that you favour me with your presence on this festive day.
Hen. and Egb. Welcome, brother Otto, welcome!
Otto. I am the man to scent a feast at the distance of a hundred miles. I am glad you had so much confidence in my nose, as to think any intelligence or invitation needless. (The Duke starts.) Dare I venture to greet
[Page 8]
your Lady in my dusty armour? (She just enters with her train.) Duchess, my best wishes for your welfare announce me as your humble servant.
Duc. I thank you, my Lord.
Duke. Come with us, Otto.
Otto. Pardon me. I will not by my rude appearance darken the splendour of the day. I shall attend you in your cabinet.
Duke. Well, as you please. (To an attendant.) Are the Count's rooms ready for his reception? (The attendant shrugs his shoulders.) Look after them instantly. Well [200]   kinsman, I expect you.
                                         [They proceed. Manent Otto and Henry . Otto. Henry!—Oh that I could compress my whole thoughts into one word, and declare what is passing in this boiling breast! Tell me—what think you of this union?—Brother, shrug not your shoulders thus instead of answering, nor look around as if some one were listening to us. Speak boldly—boldly as a man.
Hen. I wish the Duke had not done this.
Otto. Now by all that is good and holy, had I been here, it should not have been done. But I was the last, who was acquainted with it. Lewis's union was the tale of all the Emperor's court, ere I had learnt it. Is it thus that I am treated?
Hen. How! Did you receive no notice—no invitation?
Otto. I tell you, no. I should perhaps have been still in ignorance, had not the Emperor assured me such was the case. He—he himself sent me to my kinsman's wedding.
Hen. I understand it not.
Otto. But when I tell you that not long ago I asked the Emperor to bestow his younger daughter on my kinsman,
[Page 9]
Lewis, and was not refused—understand you, now, what all this means?
Hen. By Heavens, if this be as you say—
Otto. It is, it is. The Emperor sent me hither. Could he have any intention than to prevent this act of folly? [225]   He did not say thus much, but had I been, at that moment, capable of forming any other idea, it appeared as strongly in his tone, in his every look, as it is at this moment graven in my heart. By my faith, had any evil spirit wished to torment me with a dreadful dream, the most crafty of all demons must he have been, if he had succeeded in filling my brain with such fancies. Oh! Heaven grant my anger may not make me as talkative as a court-sycophant! Had any one told me that the firmament would fall upon us, I would have answered: “Let it fall;” but never can I tamely bear to hear that Bavaria's Duke, while professing to be our Emperor's friend, has married a cousin of Bohemian Ottocar, who clings as closely to the Duke of Brunswick as the iron to a horse's hoof.
Hen. Brother, many things have lately happened, which have led me to suppose that our Emperor not only approves of this connection, but has even promoted it. Ludmilla may, perhaps, have reconciled her uncle Ottocar to the Emperor.
Otto. Ludmilla reconciled her uncle! She, who so much rejoiced at the anticipated desolation of Bavaria! 'Twas she alone, who encouraged Albrecht to form an alliance with Bohemia, in order to exterminate us all.
Hen. I may be wrong, but my conjecture is not without foundation.
Otto. [250]   Explain, then, what you know.
Hen. Not here, my brother. Retire with me to some place, where we can converse without interruption.
Otto. To converse without interruption I will go with
[Page 10]
you; but not as if I wished to creep into a corner, and in a smothered voice give vent to the sensations of my soul. My words are bold and loud; for I have not a thought, which I am not ready to avow.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene. An apartment in the Castle. Enter Duchess and Wenzel . Duc. Kinsman, I assure you his hatred and friendship cannot be so indifferent to me, and I know he hates me. His arrival has, doubtless, quite another cause than that which he declares. He is not the man, who would forsake the Emperor's court for nothing, or for mere politeness. My husband has just informed me that he seemed highly incensed at not having had any notice of our marriage. I am sure he will suppose me to be the cause of this, and policy dictated it; for had he gained earlier notice of our intentions, all my hopes would have been destroyed.
Wen. True, but why need you now be afraid of him? Your Lord's affections and your own privileges place you beyond his power.
Duc. What I am, I am become through affection, and no power is more wavering than that which depends upon the humours of a husband. My Lewis is young, and, I am not so vain as to build upon the continuance of his passion. [275]   There are men, who, without fair words and smooth discourse, obtain a safe command over another's inclination: Of these Otto is one. The fame of his exploits gives him consequence throughout the empire, and, I have often observed, that my husband feels a reverence towards him, mingled with fear. All this makes me uneasy,—I therefore wish you, cousin, to sound his opinions, and if it be possible to convert his hatred into friendship, or at least into indifference.

[Page 11]
Wen. Be assured I will leave no means untried to gratify your wishes. I will lull to repose my hatred towards this haughty man, and devote my mind entirely to your service.
Duc. Enough! You shall find me not ungrateful.—My husband comes.—More of this, anon.
                                         [Exit. Wen. Enter Duke . Duke. My love, how can you so long deprive me of your company? You know my heart thinks every moment lost, which is not spent with you.—Why is your countenance less bright than heretofore? What lies so heavy on your heart as to disturb you on this happy day?
Duc. My husband! My Lewis! What bliss is there in those words!—But let me not declare the trifling cause of my uneasiness, lest your affection should find some fancied consequence in a mere trifle.
Duke. It must be as my dearest thinks it—yet let me know it.—Unbounded confidence is the most sacred duty of affection. Conceal not from me, I beseech you, one emotion of [300]   your mind.
Duc. Oh, why is human nature allowed no perfect bliss? Even the happiest state is embittered by the thought of its doubtful continuance. Lewis, I had but one wish, (Takes his hand) this!—It is gratified—completely gratified — (Embracing him) —but—
Duke. Speak, my life, oh speak!
Duc. I am disturbed by the sentiments of your kinsman— the Count Palatine. He hates me.
Duke. You! the emblem of beauty and affection! Then must his blood be gall, and his heart the repository of baseness.
Duc. I am certain that he hates me. He considers me the cause of all the misery inflicted on Bavaria by Count
[Page 12]
Albrecht. To my charge he in his own mind lays all the devastations occasioned by the incursions of your Bohemian neighbour.—Must not this distress me?
Duke. Be at ease, my love. When he becomes acquainted with your noble mind, repentance for his error will be a sufficient punishment.
Duc. Believe me an animosity so rooted is not so easily removed. To be convinced that I am innocent, it is necessary he should see with an unbiassed eye. An object, which is hateful through habit, appears ugly on every side.
Duke. [325]   Otto is really not malicious.
Duc. I am silent.
                                         [She sighs. Duke. Dearest, this mournful look pierces my very soul. Tell me—What can I do to relieve you?—I'll speak to Otto. His heart is open, and his sentiments are on his lips. I shall soon learn whether there is any foundation for your uneasiness. Rely on me.
Duc. I was just applying to Count Wenzel on this subject when you entered. I desired him to vindicate me to your cousin Otto.
Duke. Vindicate! That need not be done by my wife. It is only the criminal, who needs defence. Who are you, and who am I? I own I should be glad that my kinsman Otto approved of my choice; but to your perfections, and to no other motive will I be obliged for his approbation. Were such my wish, I need but tell him that through you the Emperor obtains the friendship of Ottocar; and, from that moment, he would be your first of friends.
Duc. I should be happy if he knew it.
Duke. He shall—and be ashamed of having, for a moment, mistaken you. But one doubt distresses me.
Duc. What is it, my dear Lord?
Duke. Whether my cousin knows that the Emperor is about to bestow one of his daughters on Duke Ottocar.

[Page 13]
Duc. That Wenzel shall try to discover.—But see, the [350]   Count Palatine approaches.
Enter Otto . Duke. Welcome once more, good kinsman.
Otto. The Emperor commends him to you, and wishes you all happiness. He likewise commanded me to state that he relies upon your sending the usual supply of vassals, and supporting him with your alliance as hitherto.
Duke. I hope you assured the Emperor of my zeal in his service?
Otto. I did.— (Looks scornfully at the Duc.)
Duc. —(Aside.) —Ha! Disdain!—Count, if you perceived that I was present, I beg you likewise to observe that I withdraw.
                                         [Exit. Duke. Kinsman, what has my wife done, that you survey her with a look as bold as if she were a base and wanton wench?
Otto. What have your ancestors and subjects done, that you should make this woman your wife?
Duke. Who can produce a charge against her virtue? I challenge any one to make the attempt. She deserves to be Bavaria's Duchess. I know, you are, in general, not unreasonable. Your sentiments are candid. Tell me frankly why you are exasperated against my wife.
Otto. Can I like the serpent, which stung my brother or my son? Still bleed the wounds inflicted on my native country by Bohemia's arms.
Duke. [375]   How is my wife to blame for this?
Otto. She it was, who sharpened the steel, and urged to war.
Duke. No, on my word, she never encouraged slaughter.
[Page 14]
Many a tear did she shed for the misfortunes which her late husband's fury brought upon Bavaria.
Otto. It may be so. Enough is it for me that she is our Emperor's foe, being the friend of his most deadly foe.
Duke. This seems to you so certain that you ground your hatred on it. Kinsman, I do not in any thing chuse to excite your reproaches. I loved you ever—love you still. Many would ridicule my conduct, if they knew that I demeaned myself so far as to defend my consort to a man, who is not my master, or my father.
Otto. Why do you this, Duke?
Duke. Because I do not wish to think you unjust.
Otto. I love my native land, my race, and Philip.
Duke. So do I.
Otto. And yet you form a connexion, which binds you to Bohemia's Duke, and to the Emperor's avowed rival, Brunswick's Otto. Our native land, our race's fame and Philip's rights are torn from your heart.
Duke. Then would it bleed.—No, this alliance binds the Bohemian Duke to our side.
Otto. To your's, and drags you to his Otto.
Duke. [400]   Why talk of Otto?—Ottocar is Philip's friend.
Otto. The Emperor Philip's friend!
Duke. Knew you not that?
Otto. Not I—nor do I yet know it. Ottocar, Duke of Bohemia, and Ally to Brunswick's Otto, Philip's friend?
Duke. This was the dowry of my wife. I required her cousin's friendship towards the Emperor.
Otto. And did she promise it?
Duke. She promised and procured it. Long since did Ottocar acknowledge Philip as the lawful Emperor, and enter into alliance with him. This, of course, you know, but that my consort was the author of the reconciliation, you seem to have been ignorant.

[Page 15]
Otto. For Heaven's sake, be serious.
Duke. You seem astonished. Surely Ottocar's alliance with Philip is not unknown to you?
Otto. You banter me.
Duke. By my soul I do not. They are friends—friends through the interference of my wife.
Otto. Indeed!—Ha! I comprehend this. Where there is no danger Otto is not wanted. Now, by Heavens this is not right. To deceive me!
Duke. Who has deceived you?
Otto. I hope, no one—but at a distance it wears a villanous appearance.
Duke. [425]   Of what are you talking?
Otto. Think!—Not to say a word to me!—Not one word!—Philip not to say one word to Otto!
Duke. To you, the worthiest of his confidence! I thought the whole affair was as well known to you as to me. The negotiation between Ottocar and Philip has been on foot three months.
Otto. Three months!—It is not longer since I asked the Emperor to bestow on you his younger daughter.
Duke. What answered he?
Otto. Smiling, he told me it perhaps might happen.—I now for the first time comprehend his might .—God of Heaven! What is this?—I beseech you apologize in my behalf to your fair consort. If poor Otto's friendship be of any value to her, assure her she possesses it.
Duke. I am happy to see you convinced that she is worthy of it.
Otto. And now, farewell 'till we meet again. God be with you!
Duke. Will you away so soon?
Otto. I feel as if my guardian angel beckoned me away. God be with you!

[Page 16]
Duke. After the repast.
Otto. Oh, I can neither eat nor drink. Farewell.
Enter Wenzel . Duke. See! Here comes Duke Ottocar's ambassador, and [450]   kinsman, Count Wenzel.
Wen. I reckon this day the happiest of my life, as I am allowed in person to greet the valiant Count Palatine Otto of Wittelsbach.
Otto. Without ceremony, I beg. How fares Count Wenzel?
Duke. Have you seen each other before?
Wen. Never in my life, but Otto's fame is as public as the light of day. When in foreign countries Germany is mentioned, Otto of Wittelsbach is always quoted among the first of its heroes.
Otto. Why all this? We have seen each other before.
Duke. As I said, Otto, after the repast.
                                         [Exit. Wen. What you say is strange. I know not that I ever saw you 'till to-day.
Otto. Still more strange is it that you require an explanation of a circumstance so trifling. Who commanded the Bohemians, in the last battle against us?
Wen. When you conquered us? 'Twas I, but I saw you not.
Otto. It was broad day, and, by the Almighty, none of my enemies can ever say I did not shew myself.
Wen. I saw the army, but was not idle or cool enough to distinguish any one. My defeat alone convinced me that Otto fought against us.
Otto. [475]   Remind me not of that conquest, for it did me little credit.—There was a coward among your first warriors.
Wen. Do you know him?

[Page 17]
Otto. Blue was his armour, and a black plume waved on his helmet. He stalked across the field more haughty than courageous, but when the attack commenced, he vanished. I at length espied him at a distance from the throng, and ran towards him—but he fled. “Hold,” cried I, “blue knight, break a lance with me.” The blue coward fled.
Wen. (Aside.) Damnation!— (Aloud.) Well, Count Palatine, you know such men are to be found in every army. 'Tis enough that you subdued us.—Who would have thought that instead of meeting in the field, we should encounter each other here?
Otto. True. The world is full of changes.
Wen. I shall now lose no more battles against you, but may hope soon to conquer with you.
Otto. I only beg you will not bring the blue knight with you. Our Bavarians know him.
Wen. (Alarmed.) Know him!
Otto. Enough of this. Have you been long here?
Wen. My kinsman Ottocar deputed me to announce his alliance with the Emperor to Duke Lewis. In truth, no order could have been more welcome to me. All my trouble is thereby rewarded.
Otto. [500]   What trouble?
Wen. To obtain a victory is often not so difficult as to graft friendship on the tree of discord.—The Emperor knows who gained him Ottocar's alliance.
Ott. Who?
Wen. Your kinsman's wife and I.
Otto. And dare you vouch for the continuance of these sentiments?
Wen. That, Count Palatine, is at present the grand object. I daily expect orders to proceed to the Emperor's court, where I shall tie the band of amity into a knot, which mortal hands can never loose.

[Page 18]
Otto. That were a master-piece of policy.
Wen. Yet is it easily comprehended. Philip has two daughters.
Otto. Methinks your ideas make strange transitions. From the knot which no mortal hand can loose to Philip's daughter!
Wen. Not so, Count Palatine. I just wanted to shew you the end of the thread, which is to form this knot. You hold the highest place in the confidence and favour of the Emperor. Doubtless, therefore, you have been some time absent from his court, as you seem ignorant of what I mean. To be brief, the Emperor's eldest daughter, Cunigunda, is to be married to Ottocar.
Otto. (Starts, and looks at him.) Is to be?
Wen. [525]   You are right. Is , I might have said; for nothing is wanting but the benediction of the priest. The treaty is concluded.
Otto. Ha! Ha!—Is this another piece of your policy?
Wen. Ask the Emperor, or believe me on my word. I was present.
Otto. By my word your's is false.
Wen. Count Palatine!
Otto. Pshaw! Thus should you have looked at me, when I called: “Blue knight, break a lance with me.”
Wen. Death and destruction!
Otto. Enraged! Well, be it as you please.—Ha! Ha! Ottocar's wife! Pray tell me the tale again before your fury choakes you.
Wen. May my soul be damned if this insult shall be unrevenged.
Otto. Why talk of insult and revenge? I advise you not to use such words—Your heat has made me cool enough to perceive that your tale of Ottocar's alliance was a mere joke. Now, Count Wenzel, if in your conscience you think I have said too much, I crave your pardon. My brain was teeming with ideas which would not let me relish any joke.

[Page 19]
Wen. I never joked with you, Count Palatine, and never will. Why am I thus insulted on account of things which concern not either of us? Why is my word disputed? It galls your haughty soul, perhaps, that Philip should bestow [550]   his daughter, or Ottocar accept her, without your consent.
Otto. Now, by the powers of heaven, this blue knight has wounded me so deeply that I feel it through my very marrow.—I must away.—'Tis incredible—Philip—Oh, 'tis most false—but I must away.—Blue knight, take my advice. Leave your sword at home, and go with your tongue into the field. If your aim be always as good, as it has been just now, your female armour can never fail to vanquish hardy manhood.
                                         [Exit. Wen. Have I then really hit the mark, without intending it?—Yes, yes. E're long, when all my nerves are strung, trust me thou shalt feel the blue knight's lance. If I tamely submit to such an insult, may I—
Enter Duchess . Duc. Well, Count! he just now left you.
Wen. Oh, mention it not, I beseech you.—Heavens and earth! Such an insult!
Duc. How!
Wen. It is more infamous than you can fancy.
Duc. What said he? Speak.
Wen. No. Let me be silent, I intreat.
Duc. If you intend me to remain your friend, speak.
Wen. I must, then—but let me, at least, think of words to shroud his diabolical ideas.—No, by Heaven, I cannot. You will be incensed at me, for being able to utter such [575]   an abominable falsehood.
Duc. Be it what it may, I will know it.

[Page 20]
Wen. “She is a mere lascivious strumpet, who has tickled my kinsman's appetite with loose caresses, or perhaps, with love-inspiring potions.”
Duc. I!
Wen. Yes. The villain!
Duc. Villain, indeed! His ruin is resolved.
Wen. At the same time, he—
Duc. Enough! My heart will break.
Wen. And should I not think of vengeance?
Duc. Yes. Vengeance! Vengeance!
Wen. Come into your chamber. There we will consider—
Duc. Consider! Oh, were I a man like you—did I but wear a sword like you—
Wen. You are right. I will pursue him, and demand satisfaction.—But may I rely on your protection?
Duc. All the blame shall rest on me.
Wen. 'Tis well.—I only request, that, 'till my return, you will not mention the subject to the Duke.
Duc. What have I done to the wretch, that he should thus load me with infamy? Had he plunged a poniard into my heart, Heaven knows I could have forgiven him.—But this insult!—Oh my kinsman, avenge my wrongs.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene.—The Gates of the Castle. Enter Otto . Otto. I have heard that a diadem will sometimes harden [600]   the heart and turn the brain. Oh! How sorry should I be, were I obliged to bellow in the ear of Philip:—“Thou hast not kept thy promise.”—Shame would choak me, could any man address me thus. Still can I hear him say to me:
[Page 21]
“Thou shalt have Cunigunda;” and now he wants to sell her to Bohemia's Duke. Ottocar offers wavering friendship —Otto of Wittelsbach has paid with blood. Why do I tarry here?—Wolf, where art thou?—Beatrice may make a good housewife too—perhaps more suitable to me. But why this secrecy? Enter Wolf . Wolf, where are the horses?
Wolf. There they stand, ready.
Hen. (At a distance.) Brother Otto!
Otto. Who calls?
Wolf. Your brothers are approaching. I'll go to the horses, and await your coming.
                                         [Exit. Enter Henry and Egbert . Hen. Brother, whither go you?
Otto. Can you, at the distance of 2 eighty miles, see whether some villany be not plotting, which concerns you?
Egb. No. Why so?
Otto. Therefore I must away. Heaven be with you!
Hen. What is your purpose?
Otto. As soon as I know it I will dispatch a messenger to you. As yet I know nothing, except that I must away. [625]   Farewell, brothers. Happy is it for you, that you can thus spend your days in the bosom of our native land.
Hen. Remain with us in Bavaria. Leave the Emperor's court.

[Page 22]
Otto. My duty and my word oblige me to dwell there, among a crowd of servile parasites. There the courtier smiles and prays, while villany is busy in his mind—kisses and greets his brother-courtier, while malice rankles in his heart.
Egb. You have fulfilled your promise. Stay with us. Methinks some mighty deed awaits you.
Otto. Think'st thou so?—Then shall the mighty deed find Otto ready.—Remember me in your prayers, good Egbert. —Henry, you will merit my thanks by going to Wittelsbach, and looking after my two boys. I shall take the nearest road to court. On my arrival, I found Wilibald not well.
Hen. Will you not soon bestow a mother on them?
Otto. Ha!—No more! I must away. Greet the Duke in my name, and assure the Duchess of my regard.—Farewell, Egbert!—Farewell, Henry! Heaven grant we may meet again at this place—or rather at Wittelsbach; for there I always feel as if the spirits of our princely ancestors dwelt in each gallery and room, where formerly they stood projecting mighty deeds, or happy in the conscious recollection [650]   of having atchieved them.
                                         [Exeunt.

END OF ACT I.

[Page 23]
ACT. II. Scene Scene.—An Apartment in the Emperor's Palace at Atx. Enter Cunigunda and Beatrice . They stop, and seem to be listening. Cun. Hark! The heavy portals turn upon their massy hinges.—How I tremble!—Artenberg is conducting the messenger to my father. Oh! How I dread the tidings which he brings.
Bea. Alas! No doubt you soon will be the wife of Ottocar,—then you must leave this castle.
Cun. Oh dearest Beatrice!
Bea. When I am left, how sad and dreary will every thing appear! Instead of enjoying a sister's society, I shall wander quite alone through the vaulted corridors, which echo with the din of arms. Oh! let me go with you to Bohemia.
Cun. Dearest sister, might I but be allowed to wander through these vaulted corridors, how happy should I be! But who can tell what fate awaits me? I do not know the man to whom I am to be united. Even my father, who has destined me to be his wife, has never seen him. He is, perhaps, rude as the manners of his native land.
Bea. On that account let me go with you: I will share your joys and sorrows.
Cun. If my father would consent, most willingly.
Bea. Ask him. I hope he will.

[Page 24]
Cun. He is of late become so gloomy and morose, that I scarcely have courage to address him. Often have I endeavoured [25]   to discover whence his discontent arises, but in vain. The Duke of Brunswick cannot now make any claim to the Imperial crown, for Ottocar, his principal ally, has joined my father. Almost all Germany is on Philip's side, and victory seems bound to his banners.
Bea. Alas, my Cunigunda! Would we were in our native Suabia! There our father was always affectionate, and kind to us. But since the Imperial diadem—
Cun. Some one approaches.
Enter Philip . Phi. Are you here, children? Come hither! Give me a kiss.
Cun. It is long since you allowed us such a happiness.
Phi. (To Beatrice.) Why do you gaze upon me thus, as if it were a rarity to see me?
Bea. This gracious look, this kindness towards us—
Phi. Is somewhat unusual, you would say. Why, yes. Anxiety disturbs my mind, and overspreads my countenance. Fortune has never rightly smiled upon me, but today she did it in a dream. (To Beat.) Be cheerful too, my Beatrice. You shall be made happy soon. Now, leave us. I have something to impart in private to your sister.                                          [Exit. Beat. Cunigunda, Duke Ottocar is eager to possess his bride. This makes me truly happy, for I always thought he might alter his intentions. His messenger has rid me of this fear, and we will hasten your departure.—What now?
Cun. [50]   My father, this unexpected news—
Phi. Unexpected it may be, but not unwished. I recollect, indeed, that once, when I made mention of this union,
[Page 25]
you evinced some opposition to it, but that will probably not be the case again, for I said a few words to you at that time—
Cun. My father, I know my duty.
Phi. You are wise, my Cunigunda—therefore I love you. Now listen to me. You will soon become the wife of a Prince who was my enemy. It has cost me much trouble to bring him over to my interest, and your hand was at last fixed upon to be the pledge of reconciliation. When you are in his land, let not the husband drive the father from your recollection. Observe every thing that passes, and give me notice of it. I will send some cool experienced man to assist you in every case with his advice, and maintain our communication. Beware of disclosing this to your husband, if you love yourself or me, be not cajoled by Ottocar's caresses.
Cun. I cannot do this, my father.
Phi. How?
Cun. Is Ottocar still your foe, that you would even send a spy into his bed-chamber?
Phi. This foolish language I expected not from Cunigunda —but more on this subject anon. Meanwhile, devote your whole attention to your dress and ornaments, that you [75]   may appear before your husband in all the splendour of an Emperor's daughter. Spare no expense—your father will not grudge it.—But ere I go, I have some pleasing tidings for you. Ottocar informs me, by his wife's messenger, that my rival, Brunswick's Otto, will soon send an ambassador hither—and for what purpose, think you?
Cun. To sue for peace, perhaps, or a temporary cessation of hostilities.
Phi. To sue for Beatrice in marriage.
Cun. My sister!

[Page 26]
Phi. Her dowry is to be my friendship, and on this condition he renounces all his claims to the Imperial crown.
Cun. Oh Heavens!
Phi. Do you weep?—I comprehend you not to day.
Cun. Be not angry, gracious father. I was distressed at the difference between my situation and my sister's. She remains in Germany, and has a German husband, while I am sent away, far from every one dear to me. Transplant a twig from any country to a wild and foreign soil—then see how soon it droops: No dew refreshes it, no sun-beam animates its growth—it droops and dies.
Phi. Peace!
Enter Artenberg . Art. A knight is arrived from the Duke of Brunswick, and humbly craves a private audience with your Majesty.
Phi. Conduct him hither. (Exit. Art) Ottocar, you see, [100]   is a noble friend. With him the deed follows the word. Go my child, I love you, but be wise. Go.
                                         [Exit Cun. Enter Artenberg and Reuss . Art. Sir Frederick of Reuss, ambassador from Otto, Duke of Brunswick.
Phi. Speak, Sir Frederick.
Reu. Otto, the Holy Roman Emperor, sends greeting—
Phi. How! What?—No more! Wert thou commanded to address me thus?
Reu. I beseech you—
Phi. Not another word! Our German empire is not a double headed monster.—A healthy well-formed body has but one head. Otto of Brunswick would have been a profitable member; but as he now dares to act, he may be compared
[Page 27]
to an excrescence, which deforms the whole, and which must be cut away. By my faith I could not have believed such arrogance. He assumes to himself the highest of all dignities, to which he has no further claim than by his youthful indiscretion, and the instigation of a few rebellious princes, who hope by discord to evade the punishment of their transgressions. Such are his dependants and counsellors. Do men like these form an Imperial court? Would it not be better for him, were he to promote the welfare of our empire, and acquire the state's respect, than thus to draw upon himself a recompence, which he has not deserved? I thought he was reflecting upon this, and kept [125]   my forces back because I would not willingly stain German swords with German blood; but now, as his rank pride increases, as his insulting arrogance resounds even in my own Imperial residence—now, I will proceed as rigid justice dictates. Yet thou shalt see how well inclined I am to tread the path of kindness. Count Artenberg, I vest you with full power to hear him in my name; but, at the first syllable which encroaches on my dignity, break off the conference, and give him safe conduct from our court without delay.
                                         [Exit. Reu. Give me safe conduct, then, that I may leave your court without delay.
Art. Would you do this ere you have fulfilled your Prince's mandate?
Reu. I am old, and know the customs between Prince and Prince. I have often been employed in embassies, but never was I treated thus—even like an offensive letter, which one tramples on, or tears.—Give me safe conduct from your court.
Art. I pray you, moderate your anger. Your business is, perhaps, of such a nature as to pacify the Emperor.
Reu. My business may be stated in few words. Otto
[Page 28]
would willingly resign his claims, his just, well-founded claims to the Imperial crown, on one condition. “Peace and concord,” says he, “are better than dignity and [150]   power. The empire shall perceive that I deserve to be its head, because on its account I forfeit all my title to the dignity.”
Art. That is noble. What is the condition which you mentioned?
Reu. The hand of Philip's younger daughter. To none but his father-in-law will Otto yield.
Art. I will instantly state this to the Emperor.
Reu. Do so.—Tell me, dwells the Count Palatine Otto of Wittelsbach in the palace?
Art. He is in Bavaria.
Reu. No. He entered the city with me but an hour ago.
Art. How! Is he here?
Reu. He overtook me near Cologne, and from that place we came together. He has had an infamous adventure on the journey. Have you heard no account of it?
Art. None.
Reu. Soon after he left Braunaw, he was attacked by a troop of armed horsemen; while defending himself against the villains, he espied a knight, who from a distance viewed the battle. Otto, conceiving him to be the instigator, rushed towards him, and with a single blow dispatched the coward. He deserved not such a noble death. It was Count Wenzel, Ottocar's kinsman and ambassador to Lewis. [175]   The titled scoundrel was the foe of every upright man, and hence we see the demon Envy rages sometimes even in the blood of princes.
Art. This is a strange adventure.—You did not tell Count Otto what was the nature of your embassy?

[Page 29]
Reu. My embassy is a secret. I bear a seal upon my lips.
Art. 'Tis well.—If I thought you would not treat a well-meant caution with contempt—
Reu. You must have a bad opinion of me, if you think I—
Art. Heaven forbid! But one may sometimes create suspicion with the best intention, especially when every circumstance cannot be explained.
Reu. Tell me but what it is, and I will make a proper use of it.
Art. Do not have much concern with the Count Palatine, if you wish to obtain the Emperor's good opinion.
Reu. (Starts back with astonishment, but recovers.) I thank you.
                                         [Exit Art. How! Can Philip of Suabia cease to regard Otto of Wittelsbach? Thou envious courtier! What would'st thou be without thy master? What thy master without Otto? I will maintain, and engrave it in my mind by repetition, that the traitor is not so dangerous to a monarch, [200]   as the fawning courtier. The one merely aims at his life, while the other darkens his fame, can make him the abhorrence of mankind, and will do it, if he can thereby forward any project.
Enter Otto . Otto. Well, fellow-traveller, how tastes the air at the Imperial court?
Reu. It smells a little of subtlety, against which an honest man must be upon his guard.
Otto. Ay, a crafty old fox has his hole not far off. Do you scent him? Have you seen the Emperor?
Reu. I have.

[Page 30]
Otto. Looks he like a man, or a woman?
Reu. Like a man.
Otto. 'Tis well!
Enter Cunigunda . Cun. The Count Palatine returned! Welcome my Lord!
Otto. I am like a shalm-piper, who wanders from one wedding to another.—My cousin's nuptials are over, and having heard of your's, I am come hither to amuse you with a tune.
Cun. You are ever jocular and cheerful. Tell me something of Suabia and Bavaria, our dear native countries.
Otto. There dwells men who keep their promises. But I have not seen much of them since I saw you; for I have travelled like a cloud upon the wind. My great desire to [225]   hail you bride spurred me, and I my steed.
Enter Artenberg . Art. Sir Frederic of Reuss, the Emperor desires to see you.—Ha! Welcome, Count Palatine!
Otto. Heaven be with you, Artenberg!
Art. You have travelled rapidly.
Otto. But have not kept pace with my wishes.—Hear me. I have been provoked as I came hither. A man was standing on the road, and at his side two dogs. One was a faithful watchful mastiff; the other was a dog of foreign breed. The man had a sop of bread, which he held to the good mastiff, as if it were intended for him, and at the same time waved his empty hand. The faithful mastiff flew where his master pointed, thinking that something had been
[Page 31]
cast thither, and that by bringing it he should be still more entitled to a reward. Meanwhile, the man bestowed the sop upon the dog of foreign breed.—I assure you this is not a fable. I witnessed it myself, and, as I told you, I was much provoked.
Reu. I should not like to be on friendly terms with such a man.
Art. (Aside.) How childish!—Come. The Emperor expects you.
                                         [Exeunt Art. and Reu. Otto. Well! What think you of it?
Cun. I pity the poor animal.
Otto. Heaven bless you for it! A blessing suits you well, [250]   who are so shortly to be married.
Cun. Let us not talk of that.
Otto. Oh yes! I beseech you, let us have a little conversation on this subject. It is my dearest entertainment, and you were formerly so kind as to pay some attention to my artless words. Do you remember my visits with my father, while you dwelt in Suabia? I used to bear you to my father in my arms—and you gave him a kiss—and me one.
Cun. I was then but very young.
Otto. Is it then really true? Are you betrothed to Ottocar?
Cun. (Sorrowfully.) Yes.
Otto. Indeed!—Now, by Heaven, the more I think of this, the more am I incensed. Is this acting like a man? —I will not say like a prince: for, a good man, who is not a prince, acts far more nobly than a prince, who is not a man.
Cun. To what do you refer?
Otto. With permission, gracious lady, when do your nuptials take place?
Cun. Alas! very soon.
Otto. Alas! How! Are you dissatisfied?

[Page 32]
Cun. (Looks at him in suspense for some time.) Noble, friendly Otto, will you not deride a poor girl's confidence?
Otto. Forbid it Heaven!
Cun. I must unbosom my distress to some compassionate [275]   friend; for though my burden will not be lighter because another knows how much I bear, yet may he strengthen me by kind persuasion. Tell me—is it not dreadful that I am compelled to leave my native land and live with a foreign Prince, who may, perhaps, consider me as the mere scourge of his existence?— (Weeps.) —Why am I not allowed to have a German husband?
Otto. Thou sweet celestial being!—Nay, do not weep.— “Why am I not allowed to have a German husband?—A noble declaration! By the God of Heaven, a noble declaration. —Now, hear me. I will return your confidence. Have you patience to listen to me?
Cun. Proceed, I pray you.
Otto. You know I always was your father's friend.
Cun. You were indeed. The whole world knows it. At the peril of your life you paved his way to the Imperial throne.
Otto. That is nothing. I was his friend before he thought of the Imperial throne. While he was but the Duke of Suabia, he once said to me—it is, perhaps, three years ago:—“Otto, I am much indebted to you. Were I possessed of large domains, you should perceive that you have not lavished your friendship on an ingrate.”—This was the answer I returned: “Philip, dukedoms and principalities cannot repay my friendship. Affection can alone [300]   requite affection.
Cun. That was noble, Otto—truly noble.
Otto. Hear what your father further said. “And now, Otto, let me give you some proof of my sincerity. My
[Page 33]
My Cunigunda will make any man happy. You are a widower.” He then gave me his hand, and added: “Remain, my friend, and you may be my son.” Was not that noble, too?
Cun. My father—
Otto. Said those very words,—and solemn words they were.—They enflamed my courage, and inspired me with delightful hope.
Cun. And now—
Otto. I see that I was led by a mere ignis fatuus into a morass. I will not ask you what you think, for one of two duties must suppress your speech—truth, or filial affection. But what your father thinks I much should like to know—Blue knight, thou wert not a liar, though thou wert a villain.—Tell me—should you have been sorry, had your father kept his promise?
Cun. No.
Otto. No! Heaven bless the artless heart, which dictated this no!—Well, I am a man, and must not whimper like a child.—I will suppose your father made a mistake in the name. Beatrice is a good girl, too.
Cun. [325]   My sister!
Otto. See! There she comes.
Enter Beatrice . Bea. Welcome, Count Palatine! You must have ridden fast indeed. You scarcely can have seen Bavaria.
Otto. I staid there just long enough to observe that matrimony is a blessing. While at Wittelsbach I found that my two sons wanted a mother. I myself should like again to see a fire upon my hearth.—You knew my boys some time ago,—they are much grown since then. One is thus
[Page 34]
high—the other thus. They promise to be heroes, I assure you.
Bea. They are their father's children.
Otto. And she, who is willing to become their mother, never will repent it. Do you believe this?
Bea. I do, indeed. Were I a mother, I should not wish for better children.
Otto. But a better man for their father?
Bea. A better than you! You certainly deserve the best of wives.
Otto. Beware, lovely Beatrice, lest I take you at your word—Now will I to your father. Should your ears tingle, think of me.—God be with you.
                                         [Exit. Bea. What means the Count Palatine? His looks were so significant.—
Cun. I fear some difference will take place between our [350]   father and the Count.—Sister, three years ago, my father promised Otto that one of us should be his wife.
Bea. One of us!
Cun. So he says. It cannot be my lot, for Ottocar has sent a messenger to urge my speedy departure. You, too, will lose him, for the Duke of Brunswick has signified his wish to marry you. My father told me this, himself, and seemed most highly gratified.
Bea. Heavens! How dreadful, to bestow our hands on men we never saw!
Cun. Dreadful indeed!
Bea. But will the Count Palatine so easily release my father from his promise? I do not think it.
Cun. Say rather, sister, that you do not hope it.
Bea. Well, if it were left to you to chuse a husband from the men you know, whom would you chuse?
Cun. Otto of Wittelsbach.—But dearest sister, let us converse no longer on this subject. The daughters of a humble
[Page 35]
knight are happier far than we are. They may consult their hearts, while in us such conduct is a crime.—Come! Let us walk into the garden, and relieve our minds.
Bea. Yes, and talk of that happiness, which we never shall enjoy.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene.—The Emperor's Audience-chamber. Philip, Reuss , and Artenberg , are discovered. Phi. So Heaven be with you, good Sir Frederic! When my daughter shall become Duke Otto's bride, expect a valuable [375]   present from me.
Reu. I thank your Majesty.
Enter Otto . Otto. Be not offended at my intrusion. My eagerness to see you, would not allow me to tarry in the anti-chamber.
Phi. Welcome, Count Palatine! (To Reuss) Once more, assure the Duke of Brunswick of my friendship, and farewell.
Reu. Heaven protect your Majesty!
                                         [Exeunt Reu. and Art. Otto. Have I lost my senses? “Assure the Duke of Brunswick of my friendship.” Tell me, I beseech you, whether I am deaf.
Phi. No, Count. You exactly repeat what I said.
Otto. Peace is concluded, then, between you and Brunswick's Otto?
Phi. Peace and friendship.
Otto. I wish you joy. But, it would have been as well, if you had given me notice of this union. I might
[Page 36]
have saved a great expence in preparations for the next campaign.
Phi. How could I? Otto's first messenger arrived to-day. —How fare the Duke and Duchess of Bavaria?
Otto. Lewis sends greeting to the Emperor Philip. He is an active young man. He has founded an hospital at Munich for the relief of his infirm subjects, and done other things which will promote the welfare of his principality.
Phi. These are the good effects of peace. I too will now devote my mind to them.
Otto. [400]   And I, my liege. I will convert my armour into culinary vessels. This helmet will make a goodly pipkin— but hold? I had forgotten there were all these holes in it. Well, well! My head has been pieced—why not my helmet? My household will, no doubt, be well conducted, for your Majesty has most bounteously provided towards it.
Phi. I!
Otto. Yes, you. If I must remind you of it, you must allow Otto, of Wittelsbach to converse with Philip of Suabia. Will you do that?
Phi. Yes.
Otto. Enough! You no longer need my aid. Your throne is firm—your enemies are fallen. My sons now claim the attention of their father. They are a bond, by which I have engaged to give the world two men. To perform this duty I will retire to Wittelsbach, but not without a companion. Since my eighteenth year I have been accustomed to this wandering restless life, and must have some one, whose society will make me relish home. You promised I should marry Cunigunda. Give me her.
Phi. Are you serious
Otto. In truth your question is the first joke, which has entered my mind. Shall I call your jester?

[Page 37]
Phi. Well, Otto! I cannot give you Cunigunda.
Otto. Why not!
Phi. [425]   She is betrothed to Ottocar.
Otto. And is that right? Why not fulfil your promise? Have I deviated from mine? Have I not ever been your friend?
Phi. Yes, but all the conquests you have gained for me are not so conducive to the general welfare, as this union of my daughter with Duke Ottocar. You, who have so often risked your life for me, cannot think my happiness and a whole empire's peace too dearly bought by such a trifling sacrifice.
Otto. I am not a sighing love-sick swain. Though it hurts me, I will be silent, and reckon it among the wounds, which time and medicine have healed. But why was all this done unknown to me? He, who can reconcile this secrecy with any good intention, must be indeed a master of the black art.—I hate smooth glossy speech. Good honest sentiments require no ornament. It is base metal, only to which we strive by art to give the semblance of gold—the sterling gold we leave with its own colour.—No more of this, I beg no more! I'll try to erase it from my memory.
Phi. My friend! My noble Otto! I cannot reward you, but be assured I will be grateful.
Otto. 'Tis well. Refuse not, then, what I so much desire. I ask not for reward or proof of gratitude, but beg it as a pledge of your esteem and friendship.
Phi. What is your wish?
Otto. [450]   To be your son-in-law. Your promise justifies my wish. Give me your younger daughter.
Phi. How!—You are too late, my dearest Otto. Her hand is promised to the Duke of Brunswick, that his friendship may be firmly rooted.
Otto. Now, by the God of Heaven I would not feel as you feel now, if I could thereby gain a saint's preferment.
[Page 38]
Oh integrity, behold thy recompence.—Philip, trace back the last ten years.
Phi. You have been my friend and I your's, as I still am. Ask of me any thing within the scope of possibility.— (Aside) Where is Artenberg?
Otto. Why is it impossible to grant what I demand? I am a Prince's son. Where is the German, who can say his race is nobler? Once more—trace back the last ten years.
Phi. It is too late. Nay, were my younger daughter disengaged, you could not marry her, for you have murdered a near relative of my son Ottocar.
Otto. True, true. I should have tamely suffered a villain to assassinate me, because that villain was—your kinsman.— Away with moderation and constraint! My heart and tongue can brook no fetters. For the sake of your own honour, I beseech you, keep your promise. I will strengthen your army with four thousand brave Bavarians. Despise not what I say, Act not thus towards me, but keep your promise.
Phi. [475]   You require impossibilities.
Otto. Keep your promise. I am a Bavarian,—a Count of Wittelsbach, and advise you not to treat me thus.
Phi. You go too far. I will not bear this.— (Aside) Where can Artenberg be?
Otto. Not bear it!—Where is Philip of Suabia, who a thousand times has pressed me to his heart,—a thousand times has called me his shield and his preserver? I will impeach him as a perjured man in presence of the Emperor, and should the Emperor support him, I will sue them both before the throne of Equity; where, if their consciences be not completely callous, I will with a single word, or with a single look, drive all their blood into their cheeks.
Phi. Recollect yourself, Count Palatine—then come to me again.— (Going.)
Otto. Hold! Take this helmet. I make you a present of it

[Page 39]
Phi. What am I to do with it?
Otto. Hide an ungrateful heart with it!—You will not?— Then thus I place it on my head again, and now—strike with your utmost force upon it.
Phi. Away with these flighty notions, Count, and listen to me.
Otto. You would not hurt me, Philip, for that requires the arm of a man . Your sword would glance down my helmet, leaving my head untouched—yet Philip, you have rent [500]   my heart in twain.
Phi. Hear me, hear your friend!
Otto. Which of you is my friend? Duke Philip or the Emperor.
Phi. Both, or you had not dared, to say thus much.
Otto. Not dared! What! Would you bind my tongue? By Heaven, as long as I can think, I'll speak my thoughts. Truth is not to be silenced by an Emperor—nor am I. My tongue is subject only to the Almighty.
Phi. Otto, methinks it would be better if you would accept a recompence from me.
Otto. What recompence?
Phi. You have heard of the Duke of Poland's daughter. You must—for fame has spread her rare accomplishments and beauty through the world. Princes and Nobles sue for her hand.
Otto. What do you mean? I know it! She is mentioned as the emblem of perfection! I have often wished to see this paragon.
Phi. Only to see her! But to see her, is to love her. How glorious would it be, if Otto of Wittelsbach, the first of German princes in renown and glory, were to bear away this costly prize from all his rivals—and he may.
Otto. (Sarcastically) You would promise me the Duke of Poland's daughter too?

[Page 40]
Phi. I can and do. You know her father's neighbours are [525]   too turbulent, he scarcely can retain possession of his realms. My alliance would assist him much, and if you led his army, your very name would strike his foes with terror. If my proposal suit you, a letter from me shall procure for you a reception the most friendly at the Duke of Poland's court. I will request him to view you as myself, or as my son.
Otto. All this, Philip, does not justify your conduct towards me. It is not right; it is— infamous . Thus much, and no more. I will away to Poland. Give me a part of your army, that I may not go like a knight-errant.
Phi. Part of my army you shall have.
Otto. Prepare the letter to the Duke, then, while I give orders for my departure. Forget not, I beg, to say what kind of man I am. Say that I have nothing of the fox in my nature, and that I hate deceit. Say, too, I am not a puppet to be danced by wires, even though an Emperor be the shew-man.—In short say I am a man, sprung from the Princes of Bavaria.
                                         [Exit. Phi. Thanks to my patience for having not forsaken me. A single word would have roused his fury to the utmost. I know his choleric temper. Enter Artenberg . Where have you been?
Art. In the anti-chamber, my liege.
Phi. Did you hear our conversation?
Art. If it be a crime, your Majesty may punish me. I [550]   endeavoured to remove the centinels from the door, for the Count Palatine was so loud—
Phi. Ay, loud and turbulent.
Art. As usual.
Phi. And to my sorrow I must own he spoke like a man,
[Page 41]
who deeply felt that he was injured. I ought to have reflected sooner, for he deserves far better treatment. I am ashamed of my conduct towards him, for though my empire's welfare claimed my care, yet should my friend—
Art. The Emperor's dearest friend is his country.
Phi. And merits he not thanks, who saves this friend from ruin?
Art. Surely. Does not Count Otto lose all claim to gratitude, when he demands that for himself, which can alone preserve the empire?—Did you accuse him of Count Wenzel's murder?
Phi. I did, and am ashamed of having done it. We know that Wenzel fell upon him like a base assassin.
Art. I beseech your Majesty not to harbour any scruples on this subject. Could the Count Palatine have gained a peace like this by arms? Never. 'Tis true, your army conquered under him, and he subdued your enemies, but was not your strength thereby diminished? Did not the whole empire bleed? In short, a longer war would have been an evil to all except Count Otto, who would have written his exploits [575]   on the tablet of futurity, with the blood of your subjects. He is galled that his ambition should be checked in the midst of its career.—My zeal for your Majesty's security and welfare may perhaps lead me beyond the bounds of reverence, but even your anger is not so dreadful to me as the danger, which now threatens you.
Phi. What danger?
Art. Can your Majesty imagine that Otto will tamely submit to treatment, which he thinks the grossest insult? You know his haughty temper, and remember his last words. “I am not a puppet to be danced by wires, even though an Emperor be the shew-man.”
Phi. Can these words have the meaning which you give them?

[Page 42]
Art. Say rather, can they have any other? I saw him before your conference with the Duke of Brunswick's ambassador? Nay, he travelled hither in company with him.—Could this be merely by accident? I trembled at the door, when your Majesty promised—
Phi. You are right, Artenberg. Your fears are not unfounded. He spoke those words with a tone, which betrayed an inward thirst after vengeance. But what can I do? He expects the letter to the Duke of Poland.
Art. That letter is your only resource.
Phi. Resource! How so?
Art. [600]   Let it be couched in terms which will avert all danger.
Phi. Be more explicit.
Art. Request the Duke of Poland to receive Count Otto most graciously.
Phi. Well?
Art. But at the same time warn him not to trust the Count with any great command, and by no means to bestow his daughter on him 'till he has thoroughly tried his disposition.
Phi. And then I can request him to satisfy the Count in some other way. Go, Artenberg, go prepare the letter, as you mention.                                          [Exit Art. My heart tells me that this conduct is not right, but policy commands it. Otto feels I have injured him, and it is dangerous to confide in an injured friend. His greatness too, throws a shade upon my dignity. I must remove him from my court. The sight of him is irksome to me, for his every look seems to declare I am his debtor.


END OF ACT II.

[Page 43]
ACT. III. Scene Scene.—An Apartment in Reuss's Castle. Enter Steward and Wallrich . Stew. But never mind that. Though Sir Frederick be from home, you and your horse shall not want accommodation 'till he arrives. We expect him every minute. If he come not soon, he will find two eyes closed for ever, which are dearer to him than his own, for our lady is dangerously ill, Sir Frederick is transacting some treaty between Otto of Brunswick and Philip of Suabia. I understand it relates to a peace.
Wal. Indeed!
Stew. Heaven grant a peace may take place! The empire has suffered more than enough by this contention for the crown. When the bear and the wolf dispute about the sheep,—who fares worst? The sheep. I should like to know which of the two will give way, for one of them must. [A cry of “Welcome! Welcome home!” is heard without.] Enter Reuss . Welcome home, sir knight. This stranger wishes to see you, before he proceeds on his journey.
Wal. (Presents his hand to Reuss) Heaven bless Sir Frederick of Reuss! My name is Hans Wallrich. I am an Imperial
[Page 44]
herald, and bring you tidings of your son from Palestine.
Reu. My George! Is he well! Is he an honour to his country?
Wal. That is he, noble knight—an honour to his country and his father.
Reu. My blessing be upon him!—You have brought reviving [25]   news for my sick wife. (To the Steward) Go, and enquire whether she be asleep.                                          [Exit Steward. I sincerely thank you for these happy tidings.
Wal. Your son, sir knight, is much beloved by all who know him, and his courage is proverbial.
Reu. Heaven protect him!
Re-enter Steward . Stew. The attendant thinks my lady ought not to be waked. She has not slept so soundly since you left us.
                                         [A bell is heard. Reu. See what that means.
Enter a Servant. Ser. Five or six horsemen are hastening hither.
Fre. Go, and enquire who they are, and if you know their names, admit them.                                          [Exeunt Stew. and Ser. Many a time have I stood at a window of my castle, when a knight has been approaching, and always have I said: “Would it were my George, or at least some knight, who brings me tidings of him!” Once more accept a father's thanks. You are most welcome.

[Page 45]
Enter Otto . Otto. Good day to you, Sir Frederick! Will you admit a pilgrim?
Reu. Scarcely can I credit what I see! Count Palatine, how did you stumble on my hut?
Otto. I am a kind of riding vagrant. I hurry headlong through my life, and shall not find a resting-place 'till death has hurled me from my saddle.
Reu. I am truly glad to see you. I will first make some [50]   enquiries after my sick wife, and then return to pledge you in a smiling goblet.—Count Otto, I leave you with Hans Wallrich, who has brought me tidings of my son from Palestine.
                                         [Exit. Otto. Came you straight from Palestine?
Wal. No. I have been two months in Poland?
Otto. How fares the Duke of Poland?
Wal. But ill, Count Palatine. The two Canutes of Sweden and of Denmark harass him incessantly. Both sue for his daughter's hand, and each has exerted his utmost power to counteract his rival's wishes, 'till at length the Princess has discarded both, and now both have attacked the father, who cannot, without foreign aid, oppose them.
Otto. Foreign aid! Ha!—But, tell me—is his daughter so beautiful as Fame describes her?
Wal. Count Palatine, her charms and virtues baffle all description. What Fame says of her is a mere nothing. Alas! Her gentle soul is sinking under the pressure of her father's lamentable situation. Happy is the man, who can redeem him from it, for on him has she resolved to bestow her hand and heart.
Otto. Ha!—I rejoice to hear it.—Who commands the Duke of Poland's army?

[Page 46]
Wal. He himself. In courage and experience he is, by no means, wanting, but Fortune ever flies his banner.
Enter Reuss , followed by a boy, bearing silver goblets, and a large flask of wine. Reu. Boy, fill a goblet to the brim. Welcome to my [75]   house, Count Otto of Wittelsbach! (Drinks.) Welcome, Hans Wallrich! (Drinks.)
Otto. Heaven bless you and yours! (Drinks.)
Wall. Heaven bless you and yours, sir knight! (Drinks)
[The boy fills the goblets, leaves them and the flask and goes.] Otto. Sir Frederick, I told you, while at Aix, what happened between Philip and myself.
Reu. Yes—that he broke his promise.
Otto. You are right. He can have no sufficient apology for forfeiting his word, but we will try to make the deed not quite so bad by saying I have been wronged, in order to promote the welfare of the empire. This will sound like lawful coin, and every one will take it, because it is stamped with the image of the Emperor.—Well! This worthy man has made me more satisfied with what has happened. I may, perhaps, succeed in relieving the Duke of Poland, and winning his fair daughter's hand and heart.
Wal. Success attend you, noble Count! The enterprize is worthy of you.
Reu. What is the Princess's name?
Wal. Helica.
Reu. (Takes a goblet) Otto and Helica! Long life and happiness to both! (Drinks.)
Wal. With all my heart! (Drinks.)
Otto. Thanks, thanks, my friends.—The Emperor has has given me a letter, which will procure for me a reception [100]   the most friendly from the Duke of Poland.

[Page 47]
Reu. Rely not on his recommendation. Has he not deceived you once?
Otto. He has, but Philip's sentiments are noble—they were, at least; and surely the Imperial crown cannot have altered them. What a miserable shuttle-cock were he, if his virtue depended on a spangle! I know a diadem does not exalt the wearer's sentiments, but why should it degrade them?— (Takes a goblet.) —To the health of the Emperor Philip!— (Drinks.)
Wal. I pledge you, Count Palatine.— (Drinks.)
Reu. To the health of Lewis, Duke of Bavaria!— (Drinks.)
Otto. That is not right, Sir Frederick. You ought to pay respect to him, whose health I drank. What have you to urge against the Emperor?
Reu. When I was sent by Brunswick's Otto, he received me haughtily, and spoke with disrespect of his noble rival, whose birth and courage do not yield to his. Otto would not have done so, had I come from Philip. A German knight allows no Emperor to treat him with contempt, for he is only Emperor, because it is our will he should be so. This, Count Palatine, I never shall forget 'till some creditable act banishes it from my memory.
Enter Wolf . Wolf. My noble lord, the seal of the great letter you committed to my care at Aix has melted in my bosom. It [125]   is not my fault, but the fault of the warm weather.
Otto. Give me the letter.—It is open.
Wolf. Or the reverse, if no one opens it. I have had many a letter in my hand, but the seal was not the only reason why I did not read them.
Reu. What else?

[Page 48]
Wolf. I can't read.
Otto. (Opens the letter.) —Sir Frederick, as you doubt the good intentions of the Emperor, read that letter.
Enter Steward . Stew. Sir knight, a messenger is just arrived from Bamberg, who states that the Emperor Philip yesterday arrived there, and has appointed a tournament to-day.
Wal. I must begone, then, that I may resume my office as a herald. Farewell, Sir Frederic.
Reu. Farewell! once more, I thank you.
Wal. Count Palatine, success be with you in your undertaking!
Otto. I thank you.                                          [Exit. Wal. This is strange. When I left Aix, no one had heard that Philip meant to visit Bamberg.—But read, Sir Frederick.
                                         [Exeunt Wolf and Stew. Reu. —(Reads) —“Philip, by the Grace of God holy Roman Emperor sends greeting to the Duke of Poland.— Whereas the Bavarian Count Palatine Otto of Wittelsbach has humbly petitioned his Imperial majesty to introduce and recommend him to the Duke of Poland.”—
Otto. How! Humbly petitioned! The Emperor did not [150]   read it thus.
Reu. Count Palatine, if any thing further should occur, which the Emperor did not read to you, I beg you to believe that every word is as I read it.
Otto. Enough! Proceed.
Reu. “And whereas the aforementioned Count Palatine Otto of Wittelsbach is a valiant warrior, and has gained renown in various battles and sieges, his Imperial Majesty hereby requests the Duke of Poland to receive him kindly
[Page 49]
and to use his valour and experience as may seem meet to his Royal Highness.”
Otto. What?—But proceed, proceed.
Reu. “The Duke of Poland is, however, at the same time cautioned not to entrust any important command to the Count Palatine, and by no means to bestow on him the hand of his accomplished daughter.”
Otto. Ha! Ha! Ha!—Proceed.
Reu. Heavens!
Otto. Read on, read on, read on!
Reu. “Accomplished daughter, as the Count Palatine has a disposition much inclined to discord and rebellion.”
Otto. Damnation!
Reu. “Yet is it advisable that the Duke should not at first seem inimical to the wishes of the Count, but awhile encourage them. The Duke is likewise hereby desired not [175]   to disclose the contents of this letter, as he values the friendship of his Imperial majesty.—Given at our court at Aix.
“Philip.”
Otto. Philip!—Be Philip the triumphant cry in Hell, when an ungrateful wretch is damned. Give me the letter. Oh that I could write these words in fire upon the azure sky, that all mankind might read them, and the eternal curse of human nature brand the ingrate!— (Putting the letter in his bosom.) —I'll wear thee thus within my corselet, and my heart shall drink thy poison.
Reu. Your rage is just. This conduct is most infamous. —Towards you too! Such a man and such a Prince! By Heaven, it calls aloud for vengeance.
Otto. Vengeance! Oh, every drop of blood now boiling in these veins would fire the frame of apathy. But, what can I do more than take his life? To the honest man there are many greater misfortunes than death, but to the villain none—and what is death?

[Page 50]
Reu. You may find other means of vengeance. Know you the Duke of Brunswick?
Otto. Would he have acted thus?
Reu. No, on my honour. Count Palatine, your forbearance has been hitherto astonishing. That Philip, after promising to you his eldest daughter, should betroth her [200]   and her sister without your concurrence; that without your concurrence he should make peace with foes, whom you alone have humbled, is treatment too contemptuous to be borne. What had Philip been without your aid? Did you not assist him with your kinsman's friendship, and Bavaria's strength? Have you not fought and bled for him? Your reward was glory and renown, and this reward excites his envy.
Otto. Ha!—Now do I see the man in his true shape! Thou envious double-tongued, ungrateful villain!—Heavens and earth! When I think my undesigning nature has been thus abused, I could go mad. I have subdued my disposition, checked my pride and warmth, and taught myself to bear what, as I thought, was intended to promote my country's good. But now, thou wolfish monster, —now thou hast thyself cast off the sheep's skin, hast darted thy claws into my heart,—into my honour.
Reu. Count Palatine, offer this injured heart to Brunswick's Otto, On my soul you will be more welcome far than Philip's daughter. The nuptials are not celebrated.
Otto. No more, Sir Frederick! You too mistake Bavarian Otto. Shall my vengeance rouse fell discord from her slumber, and expose the empire to new dangers? Heaven knows that when I helped to shed the blood of enemies I thought not of myself or of renown, but the justice of the [225]   cause, which I defended. The empire has not injured me, but Philip.—Friend, can you fit me with a suit of armour?

[Page 51]
Reu. For what purpose?
Otto. I will away to Bamberg, and appal the ingrate. Lend me a suit of armour.
Reu. You may chuse one in my armoury. I would willingly accompany you, but my sick wife—
Otto. No more, I do beseech you.—How far am I from Bamberg?
Reu. Four miles.
Otto. 'Tis well.—Death and damnation! Am I thus rewarded? Otto inclined to discord and rebellion! Liar! Liar! Liar! I defy the world to prove me guilty of one ignoble thought.—Come, give me a suit of armour.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene.—An Apartment in the old Palace at Bamberg. Enter Philip , with his suite. He seats himself in a chair of state beneath a canopy. Artenberg , and other nobles of the court stand on each side. Waldburg. —(Approaches the Emperor.) —The King of Bohemia's ambassadors await your Majesy's command.
Phi. Conduct them hither.
Enter two Ambassadors. I should have been happy had I seen King Ottocar at my court, but I find the situation of his country will not allow his absence, and must therefore content myself with the hope of embracing him as my son-in-law at some future period. My daughter Cunigunda is ready to depart with you, but you will, of course, remain at my court during the three days I have appointed for exercise in chivalry. With regard to the other object of your mission, I sympathize
[Page 52]
[250]   in King Ottocar's distresses at the death of his kinsman Count Wenzel; but it is not in my power to inflict any punishment on the perpetrator of the act, as the Duchess of Bavaria, who is as nearly related to your sovereign as the deceased, assures me by letter, that Count Wenzel attacked Count Otto in an unwarrantable manner.—You are now allowed to visit your future Queen. Waldburg, conduct them to my daughter Cunigunda.
                                         [Exeunt Wald. and Amb. Enter Henry and Egbert . Hen. My gracious liege, we beg leave to congratulate you on your arrival in this country.
Egb. And our Duke unites with us in this congratulation.
Phi. I thank both him and you.—You are welcome, and I hope you will break a lance at the tournament.— (Rises.) —When the Spectators are assembled, let the signal be given, and I will appear.—Artenberg, remain.                                          [Exeunt all but Philip and Art. Oh Artenberg, I never was so uneasy as I am to-day. Why comes not Ottocar in person for my daughter? The Duke of Brunswick, too, seems not to take any further notice of me, though in order to effect an interview with him I removed hither. This coldness on the part of both the Princes indicates—
Art. Excuse my interruption, but your Majesty may rest assured that the same policy, which induced them to make overtures, will induce them also to retain your friendship.
Phi. Yes, as long as they perceive my forces are superior [275]   to their own, but should any of my princely defenders cease to support my interest, they will be the first to turn their
[Page 53]
arms once more against me,—and one of these princely warriors has forsaken me.
Art. How so, my liege?
Phi. The Count Palatine has always been a bulwark to me.—Oh Artenberg, give me back the letter. Otto is my thought from morn to night. If I see a sword, a helmet, or any thing which wears a warlike appearance, I think of Otto. What has he done, that I should treat him thus? Why should I banish him without a cause? Every thing occurred to me, except his crime.
Art. And I cannot discover his punishment. You have but sent him to earn renown in Poland, and if it be his pleasure, can he not return? Disappointment will abate his pride.—My liege, the tournament is opened.
Phi. What can I do there? It will afford me no delight.
Art. But what will the knights think if you refuse to attend a tournament, appointed by yourself?
Enter Waldburg . Wal. My liege, an unknown knight has just appeared before the lists, and requested of the judges a lance and a sword. Your heralds demanded his name, but he refused to answer their enquiry. To Wallrich only he opened his visor, who immediately assured the judges on his life and honour that the stranger was of noble origin. The lists [300]   were then opened, and arms delivered to him according to the cartel. Twice he rode round, greeted the assembled knights, and touched with his spear the Imperial scutcheon.
Phi. My scutcheon! Does he not thereby mean to challenge me?

[Page 54]
Art. Not so, my liege. As the tournament was appointed for amusement by your Majesty, he means thereby to challenge all your knights.
Wald. So think the judges.
Phi. Enough! I am sorry I cannot be there, for I really am not well, and dare not venture into the open air. My presence will not now be so much missed, as the stranger will occupy the attention of the spectators. When the tournament is closed, conduct the knights hither that the prizes may be distributed.                                          [Exit Wald. The stranger bids defiance to my knights. Oh that the Count Palatine were here to check his arrogance!
Art. Allow me to accept his challenge.
Phi. No, Artenberg, stay with me, for I have much need of you. I was in hopes that when I had provided for my daughters I should have been at ease, but alas, I am far more discontented than I was before. I have now nothing more to hope, and hope is to a man what a crutch is to a cripple.—Artenberg, endeavour to gain the confidence of the Bohemian ambassadors. You may, perhaps, through [325]   them, become acquainted with the real sentiments of Ottocar. His near connexion with Bavarian Lewis is very suspicious. This Prince is now the most powerful in our empire. Should the Count Palatine have thought of being revenged—
Enter Cunigunda and Beatrice . Both. My father!
Phi. What now? Why in this haste?
Cun. Waldburg informed us you were unable to attend the tournament, having been attacked by sudden indisposition.

[Page 55]
Phi. Waldburg has been attacked by sudden folly. Do I look ill?
Cun. Dearest father, do not conceal any thing from us! Your looks indeed distress us.
Phi. Be at ease. I am well in spite of my looks—only rather—Well, Beatrice, how do you like the tournament?
Bea. Oh my father, I wish you had been there. I never saw any thing like it.
Phi. How so?
Bea. An unknown adventurer bade defiance to our knights. He seemed to be a God, and broke a lance as easily as I can break a tulip's stalk.—His sword seemed to shed fire at every stroke. All the knights fought bravely, but to him it seemed mere childrens' play.
Cun. I do not know whether even the Count Palatine would be a match for him.
Phi. [350]   I shall be glad to know him.
Cun. The judges must award the first prize to him; and when I present it, I will request him to declare his name. Will you allow this, my dear father?
Phi. Do so.—Methinks the knights approach. Can the tournament be closed so soon?
Bea. Oh yes! The stranger's valour shortened it.
[Philip stands before the chair of state under the canopy.— Cunigunda, Beatrice, and Artenberg near him.] Enter Waldburg . Wald. My liege, they come.

[Page 56]
Enter Wallrich and other Imperial heralds, followed by four Judges of the tilts. The prizes, which consist of a golden sword, helmet, spurs, coat of mail, and belt, are borne on cushions. The Judges are followed by the knights and guests, among whom is Otto . Wal. (Approaches Philip.) —Most gracious sovereign, the tournament appointed by your majesty for the manly exercise of your knights is closed according to the cartel.
Phi. My worthy knights and nobles, I return you thanks. —Herald, perform your office.
[The Emperor seats himself. Two Judges of the tilts approach Cunigunda, with the golden helmet and sword. The one takes his place at her right, the other at her left hand. A herald approaches. Flourish of drums and trumpets.] Her. The first prize is awarded to the valiant unknown knight in silver armour.— (Otto steps forward.) —The judges having decreed that, in this day's tournament, you have excelled all your competitors, in breaking the lance, the gracious Princess Cunigunda will present to you the first reward of the lance.— (Cun. takes the helmet from the cushion, and presents it to Otto.)
Otto. Gracious Princess, I return you thanks.
                                         [The Emperor is alarmed at the sound of his voice. Her. The judges having decreed that, in this day's tournament, you have likewise excelled all your competitors in the exercise of the sword, the gracious Princess will present to you the first reward of the sword.

[Page 57]
Cun. Noble knight, if you have made no vow to remain [375]   concealed, I pray you let me know to whom I now present the first reward of the sword.
Art. (Approaches.) —The Emperor joins in the request.
Otto. I obey.— (Opens his vizor, and casts his first look on Philip.)
All. The Count Palatine! Otto!
Otto. Am I really the Count Palatine, Otto of Wittelsbach?
[Philip turns pale, and tries in vain to suppress his alarm. A sudden tremor seizes him, and his daughters, who perceive it, run to him and embrace him.] Cun. My father!
Bea. Oh, you are very ill.
Phi. Away!— (Springs up, and goes towards the door, led by his daughters.)
Art. and Wal. Make way! Make way!
                                         [Exeunt Phi. Cun. Bea. Art. and Wal. Otto. Ay, run, run, thou dignified monster. Could'st thou hide thyself and all thy majesty within the compass of a nutshell, I would find thee.
Wal. Count Otto, what is your opinion of this sudden attack?
Otto. A brize, perhaps, has stung the Emperor's brain.— Tell the knights that nothing further will be done to-day.— (Wallrich converses with the knights, &c. who, by degrees, depart in groups. Otto walks to and fro, till the apartment is quite empty.) —Villany is not in his nature, or he would not have been thus affected. The rack of conscience forced confession from him. But, if a look could thus disorder him, what will a word effect—a word spoken with the warm sensation of injured integrity—I will verify what thou hast
[Page 58]
written, ingrate. I will fill thy mind with discord and rebellion, stir up its faculties against each other, and turn thy utmost fury on thyself, by brandishing before thy eyes [400]   the flaming sword of truth.
Enter Henry , hastily. Hen. (Draws out the letter.) —Brother! Brother! This is infamous.
Otto. Infamous! most infamous! Oh that I had the voice of thunder! All the world should know how Otto has been injured and insulted. Give me the letter. 'Tis a talisman, which rouses my whole being into fury.—What am I doing here?—Farewell, brother.
Enter Egbert . Egb. Welcome, Otto! What is the matter? Your voice, as I approached, resounded dreadfully.
Otto. At another time!—Let me pass.
Egb. Otto! My brother! Stay, for Heaven's sake. Wolf says you have been much insulted. Who can have dared—?
Otto. Philip of Suabia.
Egb. The Emperor!
Otto. Philip of Suabia.
Egb. Say the Emperor, brother.
Otto. Offer up your prayers for the Emperor,—I will, meanwhile, converse with Philip of Suabia. Egbert, thou art a prophet. Dost thou recollect thy words, when I took leave of thee at Braunaw? “Otto, methinks some mighty deed awaits thee.”—Mighty the deed is not, but horrible.
Egb. What mean you, brother?
Otto. I have been deceived, imposed upon, insulted.

[Page 59]
Hen. [425]   By the friend, for whom so often he has risked his life—by Philip.
Otto. My reward is calumny.
Egb. Calumny!
Otto. Foul calumny.
Hen. And contempt.
Otto. Read, brother.— (Gives him the letter.) —My nature made it easy to impose on me. I, like a fool, trusted a man, who once had broken his promise. How could I suspect deceit in him, for whom my disinterested friendship had already done so much, and was willing to do so much more? Even my claims upon his daughter, which were founded on a promise the most sacred, I renounced, because his welfare was far nearer to my heart than was my own.
Egb. (After having read the letter.) —Brother, this is an unheard of insult.
Otto. Does it not cry aloud for vengeance?
Hen. For blood.
Otto. (Starts.) —Blood!
Egb. Heaven have mercy on thee, brother! Thou hast uttered a most dreadful word. Reflect—he is the Emperor, the sacred head of the holy Roman Empire.
Hen. Go to mass, Egbert, and pray for the—
Otto. He is the Emperor! Dost thou mean thereby to remind me of my duty and respect. All Germany bears witness [450]   to my unshaken loyalty, and active zeal in the protection of the Imperial diadem.—But, is this an action, which becomes an Emperor? To impose upon and basely injure his most faithful friend—Otto of Wittelsbach—a Count Palatine!—Native Bavaria, I will bring no disgrace upon thy Princes.—Brothers, farewell. My injured heart demands redress. I go to place before the eyes of Philip his most ignominious conduct in its ugliest shape.
Hen. He will not regard your words.

[Page 60]
Otto. Then will I appeal to the assembled Princes of the empire. My voice is of some consequence, and Germany never will allow her crown to be profaned by this deceitful, villanous, ungrateful man.
Hen. Brother, rely not upon that. Justice is not at all times proof against a bribe.
Otto. Well, then—my best resource is left, my honest staunch Bavarians. I know they love me, and will cheerfully repay each drop of blood, which I have shed for them. They wrested the Imperial crown from Brunswick's Otto, and placed it on the head of perjured Philip.—How, if they were now to turn their arms against him?—Philip, thou hast loosened the foundation of thy throne. Thou hast trodden on the lion, who has guarded thee, who so often has besmeared his main with the blood of thy enemies. Fool! Fool! Fool!
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene.—The Emperor's Apartment. Philip is discovered on a couch, and Artenberg, sitting near him. Phi. [475]   'Tis well the surgeon thought it right to breathe a vein. It will now be generally believed that I was attacked by sudden indisposition. Do you think the guests observed I was alarmed at his appearance?
Art. It was evident to all that your majesty turned pale and trembled.—Your alarm seemed to augment the pride of the Count Palatine more than a victory. “I am the man, who can appal the Emperor with a single look.” Thus boasts he now.
Phi. Ha!—Damnation! I will follow your advice, and oppose my dignity to this overbearing arrogance, which condescension but increases.—Go in search of him. Pry
[Page 61]
into his motive for returning, but be upon your guard, when you converse with him—send Waldburg hither.— (Exit Art.) —Artenberg is right. I will no longer reply to his defiance with submission, to his pride with condescension —else will his haughty temper rise so high, that my Imperial dignity will lose its consequence. Enter Waldburg . Come hither, Waldburg. We will proceed in our game.— (Seat themselves to play at chess.) —I like my situation. It was your turn.
Wal. That move relieves me.—There!
Phi. It does indeed.—What is the general opinion respecting the Count Palatine?—I move my bishop thus.
Wal. The general opinion seems to be that he has lost [500]   your majesty's favour.
Phi. And the reason?
Wal. No one can devise.—I take your bishop.
Phi. How!—You have made a rapid progress in the last five moves.—Who causes that confusion in the antichamber?
Enter Otto , speaking to the centinels. Otto. Do you think your halberds shall oppose my entrance?
Phi. Proceed, Waldburg.
[The Emperor continues to play, but in great confusion, while Otto approaches the table, and silently surveys the board.]
[Page 62]
Wal. The game is mine. Your last move—
Otto. Yes, yes. Move your knight thus, and it is checkmate to the Emperor.— (He does this, and overturns the pieces.)
Phi. What do you mean?
Otto. That you are mated.
Phi. No. I might have been relieved by—
Otto. Impossible, unless you threw your antagonist and chess-board out of the window. You would then have won the game in a most creditable way.
Phi. This is childish, Count Palatine.
Otto. You are mated both in body and soul.
Phi. Who called you? What do you want?
Otto. To enquire after your health. I hear you have been bled. Where is the blood? I will soon tell you what is your disorder.
Phi. I have a surgeon.
Otto. He is a fool. Your confessor should have opened a vein of your conscience.
Phi. [525]   Count Palatine, remember with whom you are conversing.
Otto. Let me exchange a few words with you in private.
                                         [Wal. is going. Phi. Waldburg, remain here. The Count Palatine and I have no secrets. What he has to say he may say in your presence, and let him at the same time not forget to whom he speaks.
Otto. Do you, then, know who I am? No.—Majesty no longer bears in mind the deeds of Otto.
Phi. Why do you not proceed to Poland?
Otto. Because that cold climate does not suit the warmth of my temperament.
Phi. Give me back my letter, then.

[Page 63]
Otto. Your letter! No.
Phi. How! I insist upon it.
Otto. Here it is.— (Holds it open before him.)
Phi. Who dared to break my seal?
Otto. God—God himself.
Phi. The insult is insufferable.
Otto. Oh Patience, holy Patience, hold my heart-strings, lest they crack.
Phi. Count Palatine, do not forget yourself.
Otto. Happy were it for me, if I could forget who I am.
Phi. Give me my letter.
Otto. That will I not. Who are you? You say you are a man. I am one. Justice shall decide between us.— [550]   Philip, shall the duped friend, or injured Prince address you? But what is the term friend to you—It was your own advantage, not your heart, which taught you the word.— Thou perjured Duke, I require not gratitude, but insult I will never brook. Prove that I ever was the cause of discord and rebellion. Prove that I was ever guilty of a crime against the empire or yourself. Prove this, I say, or write beneath this letter: “ The above is false .”
Phi. Madman! This to thy Emperor!
Otto. Cursed be he, who reveres not his Emperor. But think you that you wear the sword of our great Charles to mortify the sacred dignity of Princes? Think you that a diadem can screen a shameful action? Think you that the Imperial sceptre is a talisman, which can lame by its enchantment the faculties of all mankind? Write, write, Philip! Recall this falsehood! That were better, than that I should to the assembled empire, charge you with a crime so base.
Phi. Peace, audacious wretch! I will arraign thee as the murderer of Wenzel and slanderer of Majesty. The last word of my favour is— Fly! —Now, brave my indignation,
[Page 64]
if thou darest, degenerate as thou art.— (Exit with Waldburg into the adjoining room.)
Otto. —(Transported with fury, strikes his breast and calls as the Emperor goes.) —Duke Philip!—Why should the mastiff be content to bark?
                                         [Draws his sword, and rushes into the adjoining room. Enter Henry from the antichamber. Hen. Brother! Where is he? I heard him speak with violence. [575]   — (Goes to the door of the next room.) —Great God of Heaven!
Enter Otto , pale, trembling, and almost deprived of every faculty. Otto. The Emp—eror's—
                                         [Shews his bloody sword. Hen. Oh! Away! Away! Away!—
                                         [Drags him away. Wal. —(Within.) —Help! Help! Murder!
                                         [The Centinels rush in with Artenberg. Art. What now?
Wal. A surgeon! Haste! Thrice in the Emperor's breast, Count Otto—
Art. Quick! Quick! Pursue him.—I must send instant tidings to the Duke of Brunswick.—Pursue the murderer! Haste!
                                         [Exit. Enter Cunigunda and Beatrice . Both. Oh Heavens! My father.
[The bustle and the cries increase on every side. All crowd into the adjoining room.]

END OF ACT III.

[Page 65]
ACT. IV. Scene Scene.—An Apartment in the Castle of Wittelsbach. Enter Otto . Otto. Restore to me my peace of mind, Oh Wittelsbach. Thou didst witness the smiles of my brave father, when the nurse delivered me into his arms. Then should an earthquake have shattered these huge walls, and buried me beneath their ruins, that the worthy noble Berthold might not have been the father of a murderer.—No, Wittelsbach. To me thou never canst restore my peace of mind. Sink, sink, and hide thy lofty turrets under the surface of the earth.
Enter Wilibald and Edgar . Wil. God bless you, father!
Edg. God bless you, father!
Wil. Father, where does Frankfort lie?
Otto. (Points through the window) Far beyond yon hills to the north.
Wil. Give me a horse, and a 'squire that I may go thither.
Otto. For what purpose?
Wil. Wolf says there are many Princes assembled there to determine something against you. I'll say to them: “Princes, don't do that, for my father is strong, and if you displease him, he will kill you. You know he killed the Emperor, who was stronger than you all, and if—”

[Page 66]
Otto. Hold!—Begone!
Wil. To Frankfort?
Otto. Take thy bow, and shoot as many sparrows as thou [25]   canst.
Wil. I don't like to kill a creature no bigger than my hand.
Edg. I shot a sparrow in the wing this morning, and when I took it in my hand, it reminded me of you, father, for it chirped: Philip! Philip!
Otto. Away from me!
Wil. Father, give me a larger bow, that I may kill a buck.
Otto. Thou art not strong enough.
Wil. Oh yes, I am. Let me try whether I can raise your sword. (Attempts to draw it.)
Otto. Be quiet, boy.
Wil. (Examining the sword) Father! Did you kill the Emperor with this sword?
Otto. (Stamps.) Quit my sight, this moment, both of you!                                          [Exeunt Wil. and Edg. Oh conscience, conscience!—Even the simplicity of these two boys is a reproach, a scourge to me—When in riper years they find that I could leave them nothing but an empire's curse—oh horrible! But I will rack my soul with thoughts like this, until it says to itself: “Thou hast endured enough.”
Enter Wolf . Wolf. Oh my Lord! How do I dread the sight of any one from Frankfort!
Otto. Wolf, what dost thou call this deed?
Wolf. Revenge.
Otto. [50]   Murder.—Wretched, wretched is he, who comes into this world with strength of mind and manly fire. Oh
[Page 67]
Nature, if it be thy wish to merit the title of a good mother, form no more beings with the soul or body of a man. Such are not meet for times like these—their lot can be but misery and ruin. If thou dost wish thy childrens' happiness, let their sinews be void of strength, their veins of warmth, their breast of feeling. Bestow upon them subtlety, a double tongue, and ever smiling countenance—then wilt thou form a proper creature for this hospital—the world.—But hark! who comes? Enter Duchess . How, noble Duchess! Have you so little regard for your own dignity?
Duc. Do not, dear kinsman, be offended, that I thus surprize you; but I feel myself compelled to see you. Tell me, I beseech you—was Count Wenzel's death the cause of Philip's anger?
Otto. No. Philip availed himself of this pretext to give his conduct some appearance of justice, but in fact, it was my integrity, which made me lose his favour. Thus it is, noble Princess. I bore the ungrateful perjured man upon my shoulders to the throne, and scarcely did he sit in state, ere he dismissed me from his side, that the world might think he had risen by his own exertions. Contempt for my fidelity, and insult for my waste of blood!—Such, such was Otto's [75]   recompense.
Duc. Shameful ingratitude! Count Palatine, it has lain heavy on my soul that I was the instigation of Count Wenzel's attack upon you.
Otto. You!
Duc. He roused my indignation against you by reporting that you had defamed my character. I was fool enough to credit his reports, and required him to revenge my wrongs.
[Page 68]
My husband convinced me of my mistake when it was too late, but Heaven be praised, that I am not the cause of the misfortunes which have happened. Let me see your sons, dear kinsman. Where are they?
Otto. Wolf, bring them hither. (Exit. Wolf.) Well, noble Duchess, may Bavaria hope—
Duc. You ask the question, probably, because I wish to see your children. (With a smile of satisfaction.) Well, if you suspect it, let me have your blessing.
Otto. You are doubly welcome. Otto can still rejoice. Accept my warmest wishes for your welfare—your are appointed by Heaven the mother of Bavaria's welfare.
Duc. Count Palatine, your disposition is truly noble and generous. How many a man would wish that I might never be a mother, if he were, like you, the heir to this proud dukedom.
Otto. Shame on the wretch, whose groveling soul could [100]   harbour such a thought!—See! There come my boys.
Enter Wilibald and Edgar . Duc. Dear lovely children!
Wil. (Gives her his hand.) Father, is this the mother you promised to bring us?
Edg. (The same.) I hope it is.
Otto. Boys, you remind me of every thing which tortures me. This is the Duchess, your kinsman's wife.
Wil. I wish she had been our mother.
Edg. So do I.
Duc. I thank you, sweet children.— (Kisses them.) —Count Palatine, I am going to receive my husband on his return from Frankfort. I have given orders for the erection of some tents upon the borders, where I mean to await his arrival. Will you allow me to take these children with me? You
[Page 69]
will oblige me much by it, and in a few hours I will restore them to you.
Wil. and Edg. Oh father, let us go.
Duc. Grant their petition, worthy Count.
Otto. Take them. I know they will be in good hands.
Duc. Farewell, then, and come soon to Braunaw.
Otto. To the christening. Angels guard our Duchess!
Wil. and Edg. Father, God be with you!
Otto. May he protect you, my children!
                                         [Exeunt Duc. and Boys. Enter Wolf . Wolf. Count, your brother Henry is arrived.
Otto. Where is he?
Wolf. [125]   He galloped into the court a few minutes since, but would not see you till the Duchess was gone. He and his horse are covered with dust and sweat, as if he had just left the field of battle.
Otto. Call him—
                                         [Henry rushes into Otto's arms. Hen. Oh my brother!
Otto. What now, Henry?
Hen. My poor proscribed unfortunate brother!
Wolf. Proscribed! Oh dreadful day!
Otto. Henry, is sentence passed upon me?
Hen. It is—a sentence the most horrible.
Otto. The Imperial ban?
Hen. Alas!—Yes.
Otto. (After a pause with resignation.) I did not think that I was born to suffer this disgrace—What did they call my crime?
Hen. Regicide.
Otto. Well, the sentence is most just. My crime may be
[Page 70]
termed regicide on earth, but Heaven will not condemn me as a regicide. God knows, I only felt the insult of one man to another, and my fury told me that no judge should decide between man and man, but the sword
Hen. And now?
Otto. Otto is fallen, like a broken lance. But no.—My manly courage never shall forsake me.
Hen. [150]   Manly courage brooks not injustice.
Otto. The Princes have passed sentence upon me according to the law, which considers the deed, the consequences, and the example. I have laboured to establish the dignity of that power, which now condemns me. Oh brother, wretched as I am, I still can feel some consolation, when I reflect to what a pitch our country may be raised by this spirit of justice, which refuses to be dazzled by the splendour of high birth. My disposition is well known. My motive for this deed is also known. Many will pity, none condemn me. I know that the Princes would rather have forgiven me, but it was not in their power. The safety of the German states demanded vengeance on me. Oh! 'Twas an unhallowed moment, when the sensation of man's natural freedom overpowered the duties of the friend, the citizen, and subject.—Judges, judges, your sentence is most just.
Hen. Is Otto's nature altered? Is Otto's spirit quite subdued? Who made these men your judges? Have we ever said to any one of them: “Be thou our master?” Are we to bear the yoke which our fathers—
Otto. Hold, brother. We enjoy the rights and privileges, which this general union of the German states bestow on every individual of the empire.
Hen. You enjoy them no longer.—The states have robbed you of these rights and privileges.
Otto. [175]   No, Henry I have robbed myself of them.

[Page 71]
Hen. Brother, if you can satisfy yourself with such ideas, it is well—but I cannot. What have I, and what has Egbert done, that we should be condemned?
Otto. You! You!
Hen. Condemned as accomplices in your crime.
Otto. Brother—you!
Hen. “Be the ban of the empire pronounced on Otto, Henry, and Egbert!”
Otto. Henry and Egbert! Damnation! I scarcely can believe it.
Hen. Scarcely could I, when, muffled in the habit of a pilgrim, I stood among the spectators at Frankfort, and heard the herald thrice pronounce the ban upon me. The words regicide and traitor, with which Otto's name was branded, still were sounding in my ears, when like an unexpected thunderbolt, sentence was also passed on Henry and on Egbert.— (Otto seems to breath with difficulty, and his eyes roll horribly) Oh my brother! Would you had been there!
Otto. I am there! You condemned! Henry and Egbert condemned!—No drop of Philip's blood was shed by you, though your's was often shed for him. What is your crime? —Loyalty and zeal.—Tremble, ye Princes, for Otto, though proscribed, is Otto still.—How did Lewis act?
Hen. [200]   The Duke remembered that his grandfather was also your's.
Otto. How did he act, I say?
Hen. He defended you with fervour, but finding no one to support him, in your cause, he acquiesced in the sentence.
Otto. And on you?
Hen. He thought our guilt not proved, and therefore left the court
Otto. Where is Egbert?

[Page 72]
Hen. I know not. He is probably, gone to our sister in Hungary.
Otto. Henry, Henry, thou hast stung me to the soul. The tribunal calls me regicide—my conscience calls me fratricide. —By all the powers of Heaven, I cannot, will not, bear it. By one murder Otto fell—by a thousand shall his brothers rise. Away! Seek your friends, and bring them hither, I will be their leader, and as I hope for mercy, you shall be restored to all the rights of which you are deprived.—
Hen. Why not restore yourself to all these rights?
Otto. That must not be. Go, Henry, and return as soon as possible.
Hen. When the centinel upon the castle-turrets shall hear the din of arms and neigh of horses, Henry of Andechs and his friends approach. Farewell.
Otto. Farewell. I will prepare a feast for them. The [225]   castle of the proscribed Count shall once more ring with revelry. Away!
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene.—A Tent in an open place near Aicha, and not far from Wittelsbach. The Duchess , an Attendant, Wilibald , and Edgar are discovered in the Tent. Wil. Have you no other house but this?
Duc. Yes.
Edg. What are you doing here, then?
Duc. I am waiting for your kinsman.
Wil. Where is he?
Duc. He is now, I hope, on his way from Frankfort.
Wil. From Frankfort!
Duc. Yes. Why does this surprise you?

[Page 73]
Wil. I am glad he has been at Frankfort, for he will not let the other Princes injure my father.
Att. I believe my lady they are coming. The boy on the hill waves his flag.—Shall I retire with the children?
Edg. Why retire? I have done nothing wrong.
Will. I want to see my kinsman again.
Att. Pshaw! only for a joke.
Wil. Well, if it be a joke, I'll go with you, but I must shake hands with my kinsman.
                                         [Exeunt Att. Wil. and Edg. Enter Duke and Reuss . Duke. I thank you for this proof of your affection, my Ludmilla.—This is Sir Frederick of Reuss, who is sent to me by the Duke of Brunswick.
Reu. Duke Otto craves your friendship, noble lady.
Duc. I thank him. You are welcome, good Sir Frederick.
Duke. My love, let us proceed to Braunaw.
Duc. [250]   How! Why in such haste? I have prepared refreshments for you.
Reu. What castle is that whose lofty turrets seem to touch the clouds?
Duke. (Casting a melancholy glance towards it.) Wittelsbach. —My love, let us proceed to Braunaw.
Duc. What means this look of sorrow? Is Otto's fate decreed?
Reu. It is, and if you know the heart of the Count Palatine, you will lament his fate sincerely. The ban of the empire is denounced against him, and every dastard is permitted to assassinate him.
Duc. My dearest Lewis!
Duke. Oh do not speak to me. My heart is quite oppressed.

[Page 74]
Duc. Thou good, thou excellent man! Is such thy fate, who but to-day bestowed thy blessing on my hopes, although they crushed thine own?— (Deeply affected.) —Dreadful! Dreadful!
Reu. Noble lady, how this tear becomes you!
Duke. Dear Ludmilla, do not thus indulge in unavailing sorrow.
Duc. How could the Princes condemn so brave, so good a man?
Duke. It was not the Princes, but the law of God and man, which condemned him. To pardon such a crime were to be guilty of another.
Duc. [275]   And has he no resource?
Duke. None.
Duc. Might not your influence—
Duke. My influence shall never lend protection to the guilty. Otto was ever dear to me, and is so still. I call God to witness that I would shed my blood to efface his crime, but were it in my power to pardon him, I would not thus disgrace Bavaria.
Duc. Protect him, and his children, all ye guardian powers.
                                         [Exit hastily. Duke. What means this? Sir Frederick, I beseech you, go to Wittelsbach. Tell the unfortunate Count what has happened, and prevail upon him to fly without delay. Calheim and his troop must be already on their way to the castle. Greet him from me, and tell him I lament his fate.
Reu. Age and experience have steeled my breast, but this is more than I can bear. Once more I tell you, Duke, you have condemned a noble valiant man. God bestowed on him a manly soul, and fiery temperament. Through these he became a hero, and—a criminal.

[Page 75]
Enter Duchess and the Children . Duc. Know ye these boys?
Wil. and Edg. Welcome, kinsman Lewis.
Duke. How came they hither?
Wil. The Duchess brought us from Wittelsbach.
Duke. [300]   They must away
Duc. Do you know the way to Wittelsbach
Both. Oh yes.
Duc. Return, then, to your father.
Edg. Alone?
Wil. For shame, brother. Why not alone?
Duc. Right, Wilibald. Alas! You are doomed to walk on a far more dangerous path without a guide.
Edg. But if we should lose our way—
Duc. Wretched outcasts! You cannot lose your way. You have no home—no hope—no father
Wil. No father! Have the Princes at Frankfort taken him from us?
                                         [All are much affected. Edg. Oh kinsman! You are our Duke. Force the Princes to let us have our father again.
Reu. Do not be alarmed, dear children. You have still a father.
Duke Yes—that you have, by all the Saints of Heaven. Let this kiss confirm it!—
                                         [Kisses them. Wil. Come, brother.— (Takes Edgar's hand.) —Let us run home to our father.
Duke. Hold!—Sir Frederick, take them with you. I give you no instructions, for you know my sentiments. I expect you at Braunaw in the evening.
Reu. I will be there! 'Till then farewell. Come, children.

[Page 76]
Duc. [325]   Sir Frederick, bring them to Braunaw with you.
Reu. If it be possible, I will. Farewell, noble lady.
Duc. God be with you all!
Wil. and Edg. Farewell! Farewell!
                                         [Exeunt Reu. and Boys. Duke. Let us begone, my love.
Duc. Oh!
Duke Your distress doubles my own. Remember, dear Ludmilla, remember that the mildew blights the ripening fruit. Come, I beseech you.
Duc. No resource for Otto?
Duke. None on earth.
Duc. Then be he wretched here, to be hereafter blessed.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene.—An Apartment in the Castle of Wittelsbach. Enter Otto and Wolf . Otto. Who are these men, and how many are there?
Wolf. Eighty, my lord. They are Bavarians, and there is not one among them, who has not fought with you. On hearing what had happened, they forsook their homes, and are come to offer you their arms and hearts. They are resolved to wash away the ban with blood. Thus said Conrad in the name of all.
Otto. Conrad! Is he among them?—Open my cellar, Wolf, and give them every thing my castle can afford.— What noise is that?
Wolf. Your Brother comes.

[Page 77]
Enter Henry . Otto. So soon returned! Art thou a dove or raven?
Hen. A raven! All is lost. Misfortunes crowd upon us. [350]   Troops are already on their march against the proscribed Count of Wittelsbach.—They are led by Charles of Calheim.
Otto. Let them come. They shall feel that Otto still can wield a sword. Have you observed my friends assembled in the court? Go, Wolf, and see they are provided with every thing they want.
                                         [Exit. Wolf. Hen. Prepare for your defence. Calheim is not far distant with his troops.
Otto. 'Tis well. The savoury smoke of my chimney shall lure them so near that we may slay them with our lances from the walls.
Hen. Your force is small, brother. It consists of only eighty—
Otto Men. Conrad of Aicha is among them, and if his companions bear any resemblance to him, we shall not long be cooped within this cage. Then with my naked sword will I open the jaws of your judges, and compel them to swallow the sentence they have passed on you and Egbert.
Enter Conrad , and some of his comrades. Con. Into the field, Count Palatine! Lead us into the field. From the turret we discern some troops approaching.
Otto. Are you all Bavarians?
Con. To a man. There is not one among us, whom I should be ashamed to call my brother. “To battle” is the general cry of all.

[Page 78]
Otto. Be not so hasty. We must know them, ere we [375]   march against them.
Enter Wilibald and Edgar . Wil. Father, are you there?
Edg. They have not taken you away.
Otto. Thanks be to Heaven, I see my boys again. Ha! Who comes now? Sir Frederick of Reuss! Enter Reuss . Conrad, retire awhile with thy companions.                                          [Exeunt Con. and Com. Welcome a thousand times!
Reu. Duke Lewis greets you this.— (Gives him his hand.)
Hen. Greets he thus the man, against whom he has denounced the empire's ban?—He slays his friend—then sends him balsam.
Reu. Think you that I would accept employment so absurd? Lewis's heart is noble.
Otto It is. He would not condemn my brothers.
Hen. But he condemned you.
Reu. Count Henry, I can witness that he did it with reluctance the most painful. Honour and a kinsman's love contended in his bosom. He defended the Count Palatine with ardour.
Otto. Defended me! But why did he say nothing in favour of my brothers?—For them alone is my nature roused. The voice of conscience and of every duty is silenced in my bosom. Sooner will I heap murder upon murder —sooner will I bear the name of monster and assassin through the world than any one shall dare to lay a hand on [400]   Henry or on Egbert.—Damnation! Is it their wish to crush
[Page 79]
at one blow all the race of noble Berthold? By my soul I swear that shall not be.
Hen. —(Embraces him.) —My brother!
Reu. Allow me to say a word upon this subject.—Count Palatine! When did you know a crime committed in a moment of passion effaced again by passion?—Why did neither of your brothers come to prove your innocence? They would not have been refused safe conduct to the court.
Hen. None of our race has ever stood before a tribunal.
Reu. None ever was before accused. Count of Andechs, you must yourself confess that appearances were much against you. You arrived at Bamberg on the very day that your unfortunate brother perpetrated the act, and you fled with him. I am the only one, who can attest your innocence, and am prepared to do it in presence of the assembled Princes. Count of Andechs, I here give you my hand, and promise on the word and honour of a knight that if I live, you and your brother Egbert shall be released from the Imperial ban.
Otto. Sir Frederick!
Reu. Count Palatine, you have witnessed what Frederick of Reuss has promised to the Count of Andechs.
Otto. You think there was no malice, no deception?
Reu. I assert and will maintain that there was none. [425]   Unwillingly the Princes passed the sentence, and in the eye of Lewis stood a tear. Even the late Emperor's faithful servants wept, and pitied you, for they had heard their master's dying words.
Otto. He cursed me, no doubt.
Reu. No. He cursed the day, on which he injured you. He lamented your hot temper, which had thus destroyed you both. “Woe be to him,” cried he, “who caused the difference between us!” He pardoned you sincerely,
[Page 80]
called you his noble friend, invoked a blessing on you, and expired.
Otto. —(In most violent agitation.) —Wretch that I am! —The murderer of my friend!—Oh Philip, Philip, Philip!
Hen. Dear brother, whence this sudden agitation?
Otto. Ah, now do I feel the real ban. The enraged Almighty Ruler has denounced his ban against my soul. A thousand demons are at once awoke within me.—My friend murdered by myself—my Philip—my Emperor, whose heart had never harboured any bad intention against me! Oh day of horror! I am no longer Otto.
Reu. Fool that I was to lend you the suit of armour, and suffer you to leave my castle unaccompanied. But what avail my complaints? Let us now think of means—
Otto. Raise the murdered Philip from his grave, or think [450]   no more for me. I will think of nothing but the noble Philip. Sir Frederick to you I recommend my brothers. Upon your honour I rely for their acquittal. And now, oh God, assist me, while I touch upon the most painful part of my distresses.—Frederick, my children!
Reu. Lewis has sworn by all the Saints of Heaven that he will be their father.—
Otto. —(After some reflection.) —No. They will but remind him of their father. In the empire they cannot now remain. I will send them to a friend, who dwells in the woods of Arden.
Hen. I hear the shout of war.
Enter Wolf and Conrad . Wolf. My lord, the castle is surrounded.
Con. Lead us out. Let us drive this Count of Calheim home again.

[Page 81]
Reu. They are already come—alas, before I have fulfilled the Duke's command.
Otto. Conrad, dost thou speak in the name of thy comrades?
Con. Yes. My words are theirs.
Otto. Let some of the oldest among them come hither, that they may hear my sentiments. Call them, Wolf.
                                         [Exit. Wolf. Enter Wilibald and Edgar . Wil. Father! Father! There are many men come.
Edg. They want to catch you, father.
[Otto looks at his sons for some time—then turns away in great affliction.] Enter Wolf and Bavarians . Otto. Why are you come hither, thus in arms, my countrymen?
Con. The empire's ban is denounced against you. We [475]   are come to protect you.
Otto. Know you what it is to do this? By opposing the decree of the empire, you make yourselves participators in my guilt. Surely your hair must bristle towards Heaven, when I avow my crime. Hear me. I am the murderer of the Emperor. If your natures be not roused by this, hear still more. He was my friend—he injured me, I grant— but he was my emperor—my friend. Will you protect me?
Con. and all. We will.
Otto. If any one among you had been injured by your Duke, and were to murder him, would you protect that
[Page 82]
man?—You are silent. Right! Such conduct would be treason in its vilest shape. Regicide is parricide, for Princes are the fathers of their subjects,—Bavarians, will you protect me now?—You are silent. Oh, return to your homes, I beseech you. I welcomed you at first, because I thought the conduct of the tribunal unjust towards my brothers. I find, however, it was not so.—Innocence and truth will relieve them from the ban, but guilt hangs heavy upon me. No blind attachment should direct you. Justice alone should be your guide.—Go home, and pray for me.
Hen. Brother, whither so fast?
Otto. Follow me.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene.—The Gates and Walls of Wittelsbach—Calheim and his Troops have surrounded the Castle. Cal. (Strikes the gate with his lance.) Yield, yield, thou [500]   proscribed regicide. Give the signal. (Trumpets sound.) Otto of Wittelsbach, hear the command of Lewis, Duke of Bavaria.
                                         [Otto appears upon the walls. Otto. What says my kinsman Lewis?
Cal. He commanded me to march against the murderer of our lawful Emperor, to take him prisoner, and raze his castle to the earth.
Otto. Are these the words of Lewis?
Cal. They are my words, and the meaning of Duke Lewis.
Otto. Thou prating hero!
Cal. Thou haughty regicide! Dost thou mean to sculk within thy castle?
Otto. No.— (Calls.) Open the gates. Conrad, withdraw, and take thy comrades to their homes. I return my heartfelt thanks to thee and them for this mark of affection.
[The gates are opened, and Conrad appears with the Bavarians.
[Page 83]
Cal. Hold! who are you, and why are you in arms?
Con. Bavarians—friends of Otto, Count Palatine of Wittelsbach. Make way, and let us pass.
Cal. Hold, I say! Why are you in arms.
Con. We intended to have stretched you, and your followers in the dust, but Otto has commanded us to go in peace. Make way, or we must disobey him.
                                         [Begins to force a passage. Cal. Ha! Here comes the regicide.
Enter Otto , leading Wilibald ; and Henry , leading Edgar ; followed by Reuss, Wolf , and attendants. Cal. Seize him instantly!
[He approaches Otto, followed by some of his soldiers. Conrad and the Bavarians turn, and guard the Count Palatine with their lances.] Reu. (Draws his sword.) [525]   Dare not to lay a hand upon him, as you regard yourselves.
Hen. (Draws his sword.) My brother!
Cal. How now! Is it thus that you obey your Duke's commands? Ye base perfidious perjured crew!
Otto. Bavarians, I thank you for my life, on account of my children. To myself it is a hateful burden. I have not raised my sword to protect myself from justice. If there be one among you, who requires my blood to pacify the shade of Philip, let him step forth. Welcome is death to me from the hand of a man, who demands it from a motive so exalted and to his protection I will bequeath my children.—Frederick of Reuss, once more I charge you to remember my brother and your promise. Bear my last greeting to my
[Page 84]
kinsman, Lewis, and recommend my brave defenders to his generous nature. Farewell, farewell, my brother!—Children, bid farewell to your countrymen and Wittelsbach.
                                         [Takes the eldest in his arms—Henry, the other. Wil. and Edg. Farewell, countrymen! Farewell, Wittelsbach!
                                         [The Bavarians return thanks by dropping their lances. Otto. Thank them for your father.
Wil. and Edg. We thank you for our father.
Otto. And now, let us be gone.—Come, my children! Another glance at my native castle—brother—friends— countrymen—and now away!
[Takes his children, and goes, followed by Henry, Reuss, Wolf, &c.—Calheim and his troops enter the castle.]

END OF ACT IV.

[Page 85]
ACT V. Scene Scene.—The Ruins of Wittelsbach Castle. The Country is covered with heaps of Stone and Rubbish. It is midnight. Enter Conrad and another Inhabitant of Aicha,—each with a lance and mattock. Inh. Conrad, the stars have compassion on our shins, for if it were not so light, I should never find my way, well as I know every part of this country.
Con. Neighbour, is that Wittelsbach?
Inh. It was, neighbour.
Con. Alas! why is the abode of generosity and virtue abandoned to the night-crows? This was once the refuge of every one in distress! How many thousands, who entered Wittelsbach with heavy hearts, have returned blithe and contented. He, whose language was not understood within a hundred miles, found Otto ready to receive him.— Oh, should some stranger wander hither, who, when at home has heard of Otto's hospitality, what will he feel, when he beholds these ruins? “Why was the castle of the noble Count demolished?” he will ask; then, leaning on his spear, he will listen to the mournful tale, and with a sigh pursue his way.
Inh. Neighbour, it is midnight, let us not return as poor as we came.
Con. This spectacle subdues every wish for gold.
Inh. Shall I begin to search among the rubbish?
Con. Ay, for what I care, (Inh. goes to the back ground, and begins his search.) His pains will be fruitless; for the
[Page 86]
Counts of Wittelsbach were never wont to hoard their [25]   wealth.
Inh. Conrad!
Con. Have you found any thing?
Inh. Not yet. How silent and dreary it is all around!
Con. Amuse yourself by whistling or by singing, neighbour.
Inh. Hark!
Con. What now?
Inh. I heard a noise.
Con. A goblin in the neighbourhood, perhaps. When it comes so near as to be seen, call me.—Have you discovered nothing yet?
Inh. No. We have bad luck, Conrad.
Con. I am not surprised at that.
Inh. Not surprised! Why, were not Otto's ancestors always accounted rich? Did they not give away their wealth by handfuls?
Con. That is the very reason why you find none.
Inh. Pshaw! They could not give it all away.
Con. Neighbour, let me advise you to give over your search. It is folly to seek gold in the abode of virtue.
Inh. Why, I came by your advice.
Con. True, and I own folly in having given you such advice. Neighbour, your wants distress me, but time spent here is only lost. I should be thoroughly ashamed were any one to find us here, good as our intentions are. Every Bavarian [50]   ought to weep, when he beholds these ruins, for here dwelt the noblest of Bavaria's princes. I could talk to every stone which I behold, and weep.
Inh. I have so many sorrows of my own.—Hark! I heard something again.—
Con. Pshaw!
Inh. I can distinguish footsteps.

[Page 87]
Con. Footsteps!—I would not be detected with this vile mattock. Let us conceal ourselves, and observe who passes.
                                         [Hide themselves in the ruins. Enter Otto, Wolf, Wilibald and Edgar . Otto. Once more the swallow flitters around its nest, and chirps with gratitude, then—then, farewell for ever!— (Stops and surveys the ruins.) Oh Wittelsbach! Wittelsbach!
Wolf. My lord, why are you come hither? This doleful spectacle will but increase your misery. Follow my advice, my Lord, and quit this dreary spot.
Wil. Father, who has destroyed our castle?
Edg. We have no home now.
Otto. Peace, peace, my children. The grave-digger will ere long procure us an asylum. While we can bear the load of life, we will share the habitation of the stag. There we can patiently await the hour, at which the Almighty shall summon us away. Pray to him, children. Beseech him to bestow on you two feet instead of these two hands, that you may fly far from the haunts of men, and herd with the beasts of the forest. Poor luckless beings! The most wretched of [75]   mankind has still a name; but you, alas, have none! Oh! could I weep, I would baptize you with my tears, and call you Outcasts of Wittelsbach. See! Wittelsbach is no more. Fallen are her lofty turrets, and the residence of princely warriors is become a nest for poisonous adders.—And I—I am the accursed cause of all—I—the murderer of my Emperor —my friend.
Wolf. My Lord! my dearest Lord!
Wil. Don't say those bad words again, father.
Otto. Ye spirits of my ancestors, if ye did ever leave the regions of eternal bliss when I have been projecting some exploit
[Page 88]
at the dead of night, (and oft I thought I felt your influence) doubtless ye hover now above the ruins of your dwelling. Oh deign to manifest—
Wolf. Silence, for Heaven's sake. Disturb not the repose of the dead.
Otto. Hark! Hark! They denounce their curses on the degenerate Otto.
Con. (From the ruins.) Hail to the noble Otto.
Otto. (Starts.) What was that?
Wolf. Methought I heard a voice said: “Hail to the noble Otto!”
Otto. Some deception lurks here. I must dive into it. Give me my lance.
Wolf. Oh stay, my Lord.
Wil. and Edg. [100]   Stay, stay, father.
Otto. My lance this instant! (Takes it, and goes among the ruins.) Whoever thou may'st be, repeat thy words.
Con. (From his place of concealment.) Hail to the noble Otto!
Otto. Who art thou? answer me.
Conrad and his Companion appear. Con. Conrad of Aicha, your old servant! Once more, hail to the noble Otto!
Inh. Hail to the noble Otto!
Otto. What are you doing here?
Con. We are come upon a very foolish errand, Count Palatine.
Otto. Folly will produce nothing but repentance. What is your errand?
Con. My Lord, I will confess what it is, though it is to my disgrace. My neighbour, here, has a father ninety years of age, who is sick, and stretched upon a bed of
[Page 89]
straw. He came to me, and begged my assistance. Money I had none, for I had spent my all in the late wars. What was to be done? Suddenly it occurred to me that my neighbour might, perhaps, find something of value buried in these ruins.
Otto. Have you succeeded?
Con. We were fools to fancy that we ever should.
Otto. Why so? Do you think there is nothing of value buried here? Do you remember, Conrad, that my grandfather, [125]   Otto, supported from his private coffers a whole army for Bavaria's defence! Do you remember that my father, Berthold, during the famine, eat at his own table crusts of bread steeped in water, that he might support thousands of his countrymen? Thinkest thou, they did not thereby hoard a treasure?
Con. What treasure?
Otto. The blessing of Bavaria upon Wittelsbach.
Con. and Inh. True! True!
Otto. But I have shaken off this blessing, and loaded myself with a curse. I was a good branch of the old tree, but I bore destructive fruit, and it was right to lop me off. May the tree remain! May posterity repose beneath the shade of it, and may no one ask: “Why was a branch of such a noble stem lopped off?”—Lewis, thou hast condemned me. Lewis, thou hast my blessing.
Con. Say but one word, and you shall be restored to all your former dignity.
Otto. What word?
Con. War.
Wil. and Edg. War.
Otto. (To the Children.) Ye thoughtless brats! Why do you echo such a word? Have I not shed the blood of him who ruled the empire? Shall I too spread ruin and destruction through the empire? Cursed be he, who seeks his own revenge
[Page 90]
[150]   in civil wars. Oh, could I think that either of my children would hereafter cherish a thought destructive to the holy empire,—at this moment would I dash his head against the ruins of my castle.
Wolf. My Lord, I pray you let us hence. The morning dawns.
Otto. Alas! Hitherto I journeyed by the light of day through town and country, but now—peace, peace!—I will straight to the Holy Land.—As for thee, take thy old father to the hospital at Munich lately founded by the Duke.
Inh. No, my good Lord—
Otto. Why not?
Inh. I would rather steal for his support. Would it not be an everlasting shame upon me, if I were to let the Prince maintain him when it is my duty.
Otto. Blessings on thee, good Bavarian! Wolf, hast thou any money left?
Wolf. Not more than you will absolutely want, my lord.
Otto. True. I do want it. Give it hither.—There! Share that with Conrad.
                                         [Gives it to the inhabitant of Aicha. Con. No, no, Count Palatine!
Otto. Conrad, I have not given thee this without a motive. Take these two boys, and be their protector for a few days, when I shall send a man from the woods of Arden for them
Wil. [175]   I'll stay with you, father.
Edg. So will I, father.
Otto. Have you a father? No. I deprived you of him, by trying to bestow on you a mother. Go, children. Go with this man. You know him?
Wil. and Edg. Yes, we know Conrad, but—
Otto. No more! Go with him. Conrad take them away.
Edg. Why do you send us away?
Wil. Have we done any thing wrong?

[Page 91]
Otto. Horror! Horror! Oh spare me, Conrad.— But yet—another kiss—a father's kiss.—Oh God! How difficult it is to part with those we love— for ever! —Farewell, my first-born—Wilibald!—Farewell, my Edgar!— The guardian saints of Heaven protect you!—Conrad, it was lucky that I found thee here.—Go—go—and greet my neighbours, the citizens of Aicha.
Con. Blessings on you, noble Count! Had you not entrusted such a treasure to me, I would have wandered with you to the world's end.
Wil. Father, we shall soon meet again.
Edg. Very soon, I hope.
Otto. My heart-strings will crack. Away! Away! (Exeunt Con. and Boys.) Yes, we shall meet again—and soon perhaps, for soon, my hapless infants will no longer have a natural protector. (Seats himself on a stone.) I have often [200]   secretly valued myself upon that stedfast manly spirit, which never would allow misfortune to depress it, but now—
                                         [Covers his face. Wolf. (Surveys him for a moment.) His eye disdains to weep, although his heart is bleeding.—This was Wittelsbach —and this was Otto.
Otto. —Let us quit this spot.
Wolf. Ay, come, my lord.
Otto. Wolf!
Wolf. What now, my—
Otto. How old art thou?
Wolf. Sixty-five years.
Otto. Go, then, to Braunaw. Tell the Duke thou wert his kinsman's armour-bearer. Lewis will support thee.
Wolf Could you then discard me? May my soul want mercy, if I ever leave you! I can dress your wounds at least.

[Page 92]
Otto. Come hither, then. Apply thy balsam to my heart, for that is sorely wounded.
Wolf. Alas! I cannot heal it.
Otto. Come, then. I will to the left, and wash my hands at sun-rise in the Danube.
Wolf. Have you not heard that Calheim still is in this neighbourhood?
Otto. Thou shalt be my surgeon, and my grave-digger— but not my guide.—Hold! wouldst thou be more ungrateful [225]   than the stork?—Wouldst thou go without a farewell look towards Wittelsbach?
Wolf. Oh!
Otto. Habitation, name, and native land, farewell?— Bavaria!—My children!—Wittelsbach!—Philip!—Oh agony!—
                                         [Exeunt. Scene Scene.—A Wood near Oberndorf. The dawn of morning breaks through the heavy clouds. Enter Henry and Egbert , disguised as Pilgrims. Egb. Have I then journeyed thus far once more to embrace my brother Otto, and shall I not find him?
Hen. Find him we will, if even half consumed by worms. But no doubt he is wandering near Wittelsbach, 'till he has found some situation for his children.
Egb. Our sister in Hungary will be a good mother to them.
Hen. Let us then away to Wittelsbach. Lewis, I hear, is gone from Braunaw to Neuburg.
Egb. For what reason?
Hen. He expects to meet Otto of Brunswick there, whom he means to accompany to Aix. Otto will doubtless now
[Page 93]
be chosen Emperor. This is a happy circumstance for us, if the ambassador, Sir Frederick of Reuss, keep his promise.
Egb. But our poor brother—
Hen. When we are again restored to our dignities, we shall have power enough to gain his pardon. Come! let us seek him.
Egb. I hear a noise.
Hen. True. Let us conceal ourselves. I can distinguish [250]   some one in armour.
                                         [They retire. Enter Calheim , with his troops. Cal. The intelligence may be relied upon. He will pass through this wood. This is the only bridge over the stream, and here I take my station. My duty commands me to be indefatigable in the pursuit, for it would be an eternal disgrace to Germany, were he to escape with life. Come! I will appoint to each his post at a distance from the public road. Such men as he avoid the paths, which others tread. Come!
                                         [Exit with his troops. Henry and Egbert appear. Hen. There did I sculk unarmed, while fury boiled within my breast. Calheim! Calheim! Thou monster!
Egb. Oh brother, let us fly to find him.
Hen. Away towards Wittelsbach! I know the way.
                                         [Exeunt. Re-enter Calheim , with some followers. Cal. We will, as I told you, guard this bridge. The spy, whom I employed, has never yet deceived me, and according to his account, Otto intends to pass through Hungary
[Page 94]
to Jerusalem. (Aside.) True, my good friend, Artenberg. Were this man to remain alive, and find that thou wert the cause of the Emperor's conduct towards him, the consequences might be fatal to thee. But thou shalt not repent the confidence thou hast reposed in me. I hate this Otto, and will not leave the death of my old patron, Philip, unrevenged. As for his brothers, they may wander where they will. Let Otto fall, and Calheim's vengeance is complete.
[Goes towards the bridge, where his followers have stretched themselves at their ease.] Enter Otto and Wolf . Wolf. I heard several voices distinctly both to the right [275]   and left. Oh, my lord, beware lest you fall into any snare laid for you by this Charles of Calheim.
Otto. Have we not thus far pursued our way unmolested? But now—I am weary. I must repose beneath these trees awhile.
Wolf. You weary, my lord! Alas! You are indeed no longer Otto.—But, for Heaven's sake, do not tarry here. I feel a chill through all my frame. Do not tarry here.
Otto. The place is well adapted to the sensations of my soul. The owl shrieks in yonder tree, and seems to summon restless spirits to their revels. The bat flits past us, and the vermin of the night already seems to claim us as its prey.
Wolf. I beseech you, let us proceed.
Cal. Holla!—Who goes there?
                                         [His followers spring up. Wolf. Away! Away!

[Page 95]
Otto. Holla, friend! Come nearer. Who appointed thee toll-gatherer at this bridge? I will pay nothing. Let me pass.
Cal. That voice, and that person, if the twilight deceive me not, betray you are—
Wolf. Draw, my lord.
Otto. A man. If thou dost doubt it, come nearer that I may rub my beard across thine eyes, and wake thee.
Cal. —(To his men.) —'Tis he.
Wolf. [300]   Oh, my lord! Away! Away! 'Tis Calheim, your enemy. Away!
Otto. Ha!—Calheim, I am Otto. Heaven reward thee for the trouble thou hast had! No battery could have razed my castle so completely. No mason's tool could have so perfectly disjointed it. Hast thou, then, changed thy trade? Art thou become a watchman—or what art thou?
Cal. I am the avenger of majesty and of the empire. Yield, regicide. No lances here defend thee, as at Wittelsbach.
Wolf. Fly, my lord, fly.
Otto. Otto never fled from man. Though no Bavarian lances now defend me, still do I stand upon Bavarian soil. Firm as an oak I stand. Who will fell it?
Cal. I!— (Stabs him from behind.)
Wolf. Villain!— (Attempts to draw his sword, but is disarmed.)
Otto. That was a dastardly attack.— (Falls.) —Ye cowards! —Oh! Well aimed! Well aimed!
                                         [Wolf supports him. Cal. I am satisfied with this revenge—be thou so with the punishment. A regicide deserves far more.
Otto. That is true,—therefore—I pardon thee.— (Falls.)
Wolf. Oh do not fall, my lord.

[Page 96]
Otto. Yes, Wolf.—Life ebbs a pace.—Farewell, my trusty servant!—Farewell, my children! and Bavaria!—
                                         [Dies. Wolf. Oh day of horror!— (Tears his hair in frantic agony. Some of Calheim's followers stand near Otto, and survey him with a look of mingled awe and sorrow.)
Enter Henry and Egbert , conducted by some of Calheim's men. Cal. Who are you?
Hen. [325]   What do I see? My brother? Oh Otto! Otto!
Egb. God of Heaven.
                                         [They fall at each side of the body. Wolf. Away! Rob me not of my office. I am his surgeon and his grave-digger.
Hen. Who committed this dreadful act?
Cal. I, the avenger of majesty, and the empire, the executer of the law, the punisher of treason—Charles of Calheim!
[Henry and Egbert kneels at each side of their brother, Wolf at his head. The curtain slowly descends.] Back matter

THE JEW OF ARRAGON; OR, THE HEBREW QUEEN. A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS.
[Page iii]
Front matter
PREFACE. The events upon which the following tragedy is founded, are said to have occurred in Castile, at the commencement of the thirteenth century, in the reign of Alphonso VIII.: but, for metrical purposes, I have transferred the scene from Castile to Arragon; retaining, however, the name of the king, that of the cotemporary monarch of Arragon (Peter, I believe) not being sufficiently tragical—at least, for poetic ears: several matters and allusions will, thus, be found historically out of place; but I do not think I have any where exceeded the allowed license of the drama.
In the construction of the tragedy (with the exception of the first and second acts, and the last
[Page iv]
scene of the fifth) I have availed myself of the Spanish play on the same subject, the Raquel of Vicente Garcia de la Huerta, prefixed to which is printed the following ‘argumento’:
“Pues el Rey ovó pasados todos estos trabajos en el comienzo quando reynó, e fue casado, fuese para Toledo con su mujer Dona Leonor, e estando y, pagóse mucho de una Judia que avie nombre Fermosa, e olvidó la mujer, e encerróse con ella gran tiempo, en guisa que non se podie partir de ella por ninguna manera, nin se pagaba tanto de cosa ninguna, e estubo encerrado con ella poco menos de siete anos, que non se membraba de si, nin de su Reyno, nin de otra cosa ninguna. Estonce ovieron su acuerdo los omes buenos del Reyno, como pusiesen algun recando en aquel fecho tan malo e tan desaguisado: e acordaron, que la matasen: e que asi cobrarien a su Senor, que tienen por perdido: e con este acuerdo fueronse para allá, e entraron al Rey diciendo que querian fabrar con el, e mientras los unos fabraron con el Rey, entraron otros donde estaba aquella Judia en muy nobles estrados, e degollaronla.”—Chrón. Gen.

[Page v]
Of the Spanish play, the ‘personas’ are as follow: “Alfonso Octavo, Rey de Castilla. Raquel, Judia. Ruben, Confidente de Raquel. Hernan Garcia de Castro, Rico Hombre. Alvar Fanez, Rico Hombre. Garceran Manrique de Lara, Rico Hombre. Castellanos. Guardia del Rey. Acompanamento de Judios y Judias.”
From this, it will be seen that in the entire portraiture of Xavier , and, consequently, in the main design of the present tragedy, I stand not in the least in the shadow of my foreign predecessor, however I may be so placed in regard to many of its details. By the characters of Xavier and Rachel , the reader may be not unfrequently reminded of the origin of the “days of Purim,” which inspired for France one of the most forcible of the elegant dramatic poems of the classical Racine.
Thus much as to the subject of the tragedy. Its failure on the stage only renders its publication the more imperative; as the few whose good opinion
[Page vi]
I covet, will, perhaps, be led by its perusal to think not unfavourably of the drama, in spite of the united outcry of the “critics;” some of whom, indeed, do me the justice first to misquote my lines, and then charitably load me with the burthen of their own stupidity:
“Faciunt næ, intelligendo ut nihil intelligant.” Moreover, it has been asserted by certain of these benevolent men, that every passage at all worthy of notice in the tragedy, is derived from the pages of our glorious old dramatists: this is a direct falsehood, and they know it to be so; but who shall give the lie to the oracle, though a wooden god pronounce it?
Amid the general cry of condemnation (the invariable portion of ill-success, merited or unmerited) which has of late been rung so cheerily and continually in my ears, and which might well dismay any but a mind predetermined to persevere and to succeed, some few journalists have ventured to speak of the tragedy with a little liberality and fairness; but one gentleman alone has stood aloof from the
[Page vii]
mob of critics, and gilded the storm about me with the radiance of encouraging criticism: I am a debtor to his justice for the remainder of my life.
To confirm the opinion of two or three sensible people, that there is at least one superfluous office in the state, those ‘words and sentences’ which were struck by the Deputy Play-Licenser from the manuscript copy of the tragedy submitted to him for his approval, I have caused to be printed in capitals: the liberal reader will smile in perusing them; and deign, perhaps, to anticipate with some pleasure the speedy abolition of a childish tribunal. Of course, the revered name of the Deity, wherever it occurs, was erased by the great religious and moral pen of the licenser, and altogether abjured in stage-utterance: still, I have not hesitated to retain it in many places; having yet to learn, that it is not the part of the dramatist to make his characters speak as men speak; having yet to feel, that piety, or impiety, dwells rather in words, than thoughts—on the lips, than in the mind.

Main text ACT THE FIRST. SCENE I. A Public Place. Enter Garcia and Alvaro . Gar.
My Lord Alvaro! is 't six years, or seven,
Since this our Arragon, Castile, Navarre,
In triple league defensive, at Toloza
Play'd havoc with the invasive infidels;
And down a hundred thousand Moorish throats
Cramm'd Christian steel; at which time, our changed King
So dealt with war, that Spain saluted him
The Mars of Arragon—Is 't six, or seven? Alv.
Now seven, Lord Garcia. Gar.
Seven, is it, Sir?
[Page 2]

Why, then, I say, the seventh solemnity,
Which should to-morrow re-instate at full
That great day in the public memory,
Will lack its first-year lustre. Alv.
Grievously:
Changed King, indeed! and much-changed kingdom, too!
Alphonso's grown a common reveller—
Crows 'mid his women like a Musselman;
And so disports him with his new-bought toy,
This Bride elect (whose fate calls out on pity,
That virtue, youth and beauty should be bound
To such a mate) his glory seems a dream,
Gilding the drowsy sleep of luxury. Gar.
'Twill be so, till a tempest waken him.
[25]   The treasury is unlined: mere poverty
Shall make the festival a threadbare show,
With splendor of past years comparison'd;
That victory from her faded celebration
Shall turn, shame-blushingly. Alv.
Would 'twere not so!
Faugh! 'tis Manrique. Gar.
I dislike the man;
He is the merest trimmer of the court,
And flatters low as fawning. What's the matter? Enter Manrique . Man.
O, my sweet lords! upon a merry time
Ye hang like sackcloth on a wanton nun:
Dear lords! why frown ye? Alv.
Sure, our faces are
As much our own as is a paid-for vest?
[Page 3]

And that we wear so fashion'd as we will,
Not being men o' the mode. Gar.
What cause for smiling? Man.
To-morrow's sun must teach ye, gentlemen:
The festival and marriage of the King—
Two suns at once in joy's meridian!
Will wake high jubilee:—magnificence,
By lighter graces temper'd, all past pomp
Shall render vile and ugly; every veteran
Shall fight Toloza's battle o'er again
[50]   A thousand times i'the day, for valiant joy
At its so worthy celebration,
Made doubly glorious by god Hymen's torch,
Lighting to heaven a royal votary! Gar.
So!
Are Saragossa's tradesmen liberal?
Her artists, patriots? that they offer gratis
Unto her glory's annual ordinance,
Which hath been dwindling yearly, and tends fast
Toward blank omission. Alv.
Prithee, Lord, some light! Man.
Gods! gentlemen, d'ye think his Majesty
Hath no substantial subjects? faith, ye err.
Lords, we're as full of Jews as Egypt was,
Before the Red-Sea-miracle : these Hebrews
Agree, by contribution voluntary,
To patch the garment of to-morrow's state
And tinsel it with golden novelty. Gar.
What! more exaction? more oppression? more—
O, O, these Jews have doff'd the spirits of men,
[Page 4]

And, beast-like, brook the pannier and the goad!
Now, by heaven's God! altho' a Christian,
I'd rather see Alphonso don the helm
And draw the sword, to free Spain from her locusts,
The swarthy Moors, than meanly persecute
[75]   These unoffending Israelites at home—
Altho' I love them not. Alv.
A scourge upon them!
I loath the thieves; and bless Necessity
That grips them in her talons. Gar.
You have cause.
Shoot me this sparrow! Come, sir; we'll to court,
Having to do with these solemnities.                                          [Exeunt Garcia and Alvaro . Man.
This they call manly breeding, bearded manners :
Now the gods send them barbers! He hath cause ?
To hate Jews' flesh? What cause? I know the cause:
He loved a Jewess better than a Jew;
But she, sir, with her pretty Hebrew nails
Writ her religion on his Christian skin
In red-line characters; and since that hap,
The Devil and a Jew are one to him. Enter Reuben .
Where go'st thou, son of Israel? Reu.
Mind thy ways!
What's that to thee! Man.
Reuben, hast heard the news? Reu.
Ay; ay; a curse upon ye Christians!—ay:
[Page 5]

We toil and sweat, that ye may squander; fie!
What are your triumphs and your ceremonies
To us? What, what to us—that we must pay for 'em?
We labour honestly, give no offence,
[100]   And yet ye rob us; fie upon ye! fie; Man.
Dog! mend thy manners, or we'll have thee whipp'd!
Or closely pinion'd in a pillory—
A scare-crow for all grumblers. Dog! I say. Reu.
I meant no treason. Blotches foul ye all!
The curse of fire consume ye!—O, these imposts! Man.
What is thy errand, Jew?—I ask again. Reu.
And I reply again—What's that to thee? Man.
Thou trudgest vainly; I can tell thine errand;
Thou go'st to Xavier's, to consult for means
To 'scape the levy; for he's prince among ye. Reu.
Ay, by the Sabbath! 'tis a princely Jew! Man.
Thou tramp'st in vain:
The state needs money, and must have supply.
Go! go! get shaved; thy beard offendeth me. Reu.
I do not keep it growing for thy pleasure. Man.
Well, get to Xavier: should you see his daughter,
Commend my Lord Alvaro to her nails.
Have thy chest ready, Reuben; 'tis too full
Get thee a sickle, Jew, and reap thy chin;
Thou'dst look more like a Christian, would'st thou shave.                                          [Exit. Reu.
That honest men should labor, to feed flies!—
And not their need, but waste!—It must not be:
[Page 6]

Five hundred thousand dollars to be raised—
And all from Jews! I say, it must not be:
[125]   I'll hear of Xavier—he is bold and wise.                                          [Exit. SCENE II. An Apartment in Xavier's House. Enter Xavier and Lopez . Xav.
So many of my friends call'd here to day!
That's something strange: you should not have denied me. Lop.
I but obey'd your own injunction, sir,
Which did desire unbroken privacy. Xav.
Spake they of aught? Lop.
They were most urgent, sir,
To be admitted, to have word with you,
Concerning some new edict of the king,
Bearing on our persuasion. Xav.
So! An edict?
Admit the next that calls. Wait at the door.
An edict, did you say? Lop.
Ay, sir. Xav.
What now?—
What does my daughter with her time to day? Lop.
She's in the chamber, sir, which fronts the east,
Reading that story of ambitious love,
Written in Spanish, which you chide her for. Xav.
God bless her—and forbid that I should chide!
Yet should she love the language of her sires
Before the modern jargon: in our Hebrew
There's matter for all hearts. Well, get thee in!                                          [Exit Lopez .
[Page 7]

An edict!—that's a word for, persecution ;
Edict and persecution —they're the same;
[25]   And have been, since we wept at Babylon;
And shall be, till we gather us again
In the divine Jerusalem foretold.
O, Judah! thou art gone out from thyself;
My country! thou'rt the shadow of a name; 2
My countrymen! ye're scatter'd o'er the earth,
And feed on those that hate ye; yet ye prosper,
And are a mighty people, strong in gold—
The sceptre of all kingdoms! Were ye gather'd ,
O, were ye gather'd, ye were terrible
Within the world—and holy, and set up
'Mid the prime potentates: the curse of Heaven
That hangs so dark and heavily upon ye
Cannot endure for ever; and ye shall be,
Ye shall be a proud nation once again—
And have your prophets, princes, and your rulers,
As in the time of old:—it is decreed! 3
But I, the rightful heir of your great kings
(Whose just inheritance were camps and thrones)
Must live a stranger to your renovation; 4
Find all my glory on the abject mart,
And die uncrown'd among ye! Yet I reign;
Reign in your hearts—in thousands of your hearts!
And so, I have a glory; and being great
Amid the wreck of greatness, live content.
[50]   I marvel no one knocks: this edict haunts me,
Like the pale coming of a wonted ghost!
[Page 8]
Enter Reuben . Reu.
Good greeting to the love of Israel! Xav.
Ha! Reuben? I am passing glad to see you!
What is this edict, Reuben? burning? flaying?
Exile? extortion?—Let me hear it!—Come! Reu.
You know to-morrow is the festival
That doth commemorate the Christians' battle—
And that Alphonso's marriage to the princess
Goes hand-in-hand with't—a twin ceremony! Xav.
I do; go on. Reu.
'Twill be a rare one, and
The charge excessive: have you heart to pay for't? Xav.
Name me the sum—I know the sum is named;
They're ever quick to save us calculation. Reu.
Five hundred thousand crowns! Is it enough? Xav.
'Tis not the sum, tho' that is vast enough;
'Tis not the sum, Reuben—'tis not the sum!
It is the principle, the system, Reuben,
In which consists the wickedness o'the act
And our great wrong, which if we tamely stoop to,
We build a precedent, whose after use
Shall strip us even to rawness—Lopez, ho! Enter Lopez .
Get my good vestments ready; make them neat,
And hang them in my study—presently.                                          [Exit Lopez .
[75]   Reuben, I will to court. I hate the king,
Despite his royal courtesy of speech
And specious bearing to me: that estate
I held at Borja was my daughter's pride;
She seldom weeps—yet wept at leaving it:
'Twas princely tyranny that forced me sell!
[Page 9]
Reu.
Ay, and for half its worth—the mischief on't!
Your goodly citizen had given double. Xav.
I hate him, Reuben; yet I will to court,
To beg reversion of this ominous edict—
Cloud-black with woe to our fraternity.
I've done him golden service frequently;
And 'twas in private—of no public note;
So have I more than common privilege,
And I will use it for our common good—
And shrewdly too. Reu.
Our prophet be your speed! Enter Lopez . Ser.
Some twenty merchants, sir, stand in the hall,
Waiting your leisure. Xav.
I will come to them.                                          [Exit Lopez .
Go with me, Reuben; help me don my vest;
Courts even from Jews crave courtly ceremony—
I would be stately, tho' I go to sue.
O, note in me our country's downfall, Reuben:
The kings of Judah were not wont to beg!                                          [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Chamber of State, in the Palace. Flourish. Enter Alphonso and Isabella , with Garcia, Alvaro, Manrique , and Lords and Ladies, in attendance. Alph.
Now will we teach ye, dames and gentlemen,
To keep the cup of pleasure ever full,
And yet be ever drinking: jocund mirth,
Being gay tenant of the monarch's heart,
[Page 10]

Should in each subject bosom property
A joyous home—fulfilling loyalty!
What says our future queen? Isa.
That I am happy, sir,
Even to the top of joy; and truth is, swim
In the deep tide of my felicity
So giddily, 'tis marvel I not drown. Man.
O, warily! your grace: if you should sink,
Mirth's self goes souse—and we are mourners all. Alph.
Good my Lord Garcia, and my Lord Alvaro!
There lives but little pleasure in your eyes,
Howe'er attemper'd be your spirits within:
What's with you, friends? Alv.
So please your majesty!
The dusky vision of a cloud of Moors,
Dark'ning our Spanish earth, was on my soul;
Which made me think, 'twere better to be winning
Another battle, than defeating Time
By idle celebration of one past—
And better fighting, sire, than marrying. Gar.
[25]   And I, all duty to your majesty
Still jewell'd in the casket of my heart,
Was making question of that policy
Which lays a burthen on a peaceful people,
Who pay all dues of custom to the state,
Merely to fill the gap which unthrift makes
In the state's means. Alph.
We are not for schooling, lords:
'Twere best ill-humour knew to keep at home;
For out-doors, she's a pest.
[Page 11]
Alv.
Heaven save the king! Gar.
And may no cares await his majesty!                                          [Exeunt Garcia and Alvaro . Alph.
But that the pure white pleasure of the time
Must have no stain of discord, we could find
A corner in our heart for passion now!
Darkness flies light, and so these lords are gone.
Lead to the banquet! and let music play,
Sweet as the heart-sweet music in our souls! Enter an Attendant. Atten.
Sire, the Jew Xavier craves an audience. Alph.
He squanders labor; but we'll hear him, sir.                                          [Exit Attendant.
Tarry, princess! I'd have thee see this Jew:
He's prince and prophet of our Israelites;
And hath a bearing of some royalty,
Which much confirms him in that eminence. Isa.
I've heard our ladies word him handsomely,
[50]   Praising the noble presence of the Jew. Alph.
I pray thee, note him—thou'rt a judge of men. Man.
He's coming now, my liege. Enter Xavier . Alph.
Thou'rt welcome, Xavier. Xav.
I'm not quite sure of that. I thank your highness. Alph.
Jew! thou forget'st thy wonted courtesy,
Paying no homage to a lady by;
And she, the bride elect of Arragon:
Hath she thy tribute? Xav.
I do think her fair;
But since my youth, I've found fair oft is foul,
[Page 12]

Which knowledge moderates doting. Isa.
O, sir Jew,
Must I then be the flatterer? Trust me, Xavier,
Thou look'st a very King of Israel;
And I could deem that, twenty years ago,
Thou had'st a Christian power o'er Christain maids,
Infecting them with Jewish honesty. Xav.
They've Christians plenty, dame, to serve the turn
You drive at. Lucky! Strange beasts couple not. Man.
But now thou art a very scurvy fellow;
Nothing but Jew—Jew all, from top to toe—
That gazing on the beauty of a princess,
Kneel'st not in worship; thou art stiff-neck'd, Jew;
And I could wish we were well rid of thee:
[75]   Thy presence does inflict a circumcision. Xav.
Oh! check thee, Xavier! Shall a yelp draw thunder?—
Your majesty keeps curs. Alph.
What says the noble Jew? Xav.
That if you highness needs must have a cur
Still yelping at your postern, when a friend
Comes to the gate (and you have call'd me, friend )
It were best muzzled; tho' no harm, 'tis nuisance. Isa.
No anger, prithee, Jew; we were but merry. Xav.
Madam, I would not be your merriment.
Thus stands it, King!—I would have speech with you:
If that your majesty have private leisure,
Let it be now; if not, soon as may be;—
This known—my business is peremptory,
And prays for swift despatch.
[Page 13]
Alph.
Lords, by your leave:
And gentle princess! bid the banquet wait,
Until our audience with the Jew is done.                                          [Exeunt Isabella and Courtiers.
How can I serve thee, Xavier? Xav.
Is it possible?
That you, my liege—a king, for chivalry
By fame high-trumpeted, and with a soul
Hereto deem'd honest and right honorable
In all the level and rough ways of life—
Can, in the whole world's face, inflict a wrong
[100]   On a great body of industrious men;
And with the guilt thereof hot in your soul—
Your fingers itching for that wrong's foul profit—
Unto that body's representative,
Coming to plead on justice' strict behalf
For mercy that's mere right—say, with cold eye
And ignorant tongue— How can I serve thee, sir ?
By Judah's God! my liege, it makes me mad,
And underfoot beats reverence! Alph.
Honest Xavier,
We are too happy now to quarrel with thee;
Be temperate, Jew: that edict must have force.
For Arragon to duck her stately head,
And underpace worse kingdoms, were to ink
Our regal annals with a filthy blot,
Mark for the eternal future's contumely;
And that she should do, if her annual rite,
To which the world's eye turneth commenting,
Lacking its wont, made shew of poverty.
[Page 14]

The state doth lack five-hundred-thousand crowns,
The which she deigns to borrow of your tribe. Xav.
Borrow ! and, borrow !—'tis the word in vogue;
But, pay comes never in your memories:
I'm sick of that word, borrow ! Alph.
More respect!
[125]   The state accepts assistance in that sum—
From those who owe her debts of gratitude,
For shelter and all best indulgencies;
'Tis needful, Jew—and so, our edict's firm. Xav.
The money may be needful—not the edict;
Recall the edict—you shall have the money.
Alphonso—my dread liege!—I've done you service,
I should be vain to boast; I lent you gold
When you had private need, and much did fear
Lest naked kingship should be subjects' scorn;
And when your choice did point at my estate,
You had it freely, sire. Alph.
We bought it freely;
But it was sold us with reluctance, Jew. Xav.
You had it—it suffices: for my service—
And waiting service sure may beg a crumb—
I this entreat—annul me this black edict,
Which points at all my nation thro' the earth,
As men fit to be robb'd by proclamation;
As legal victims for illegal outrage;
And gives the cue to all earth's sovereignties
To plunder us by warrant of enaction,
And stifle outcry with the gag of law:
Annul the edict, gracious Arragon!
[Page 15]

And here I undertake—by that good trust
[150]   And deference my brethren render me—
To raise the sum in private, and unvoiced
Place it within your royal treasury;
So shall you still enjoy the benefit,
And we not whipt in open market-place
With lash unmerited of hangman law—
I kneel till I am answer'd. Alph.
Rise! at once:
We honor thee with much regard, good Jew;
But our decrees, like those of that great power
We represent on earth , never know change:
The edict must stand firm! Xav.
Beseech thee, no! Alph.
Thou kneel'st in vain—we are not to be moved. Xav.
Am I refused? Alph.
Ay; by my sceptre! Jew. Xav.
Why, then—my curses on thee! wanton king—
And know, I speak with the descended voice
Of Judah's and of Israel's thousand kings!
Compared with whom...Oh! with the least of whom...
Alphonso's but a petty magistrate!
They curse thee in my cursing: may'st thou riot,
Till pleasure rot thee! and thy end, be this ..
Exile and death by subjects' rebel hands!
Know too, we will not yield to this oppression;
[175]   But will resist your thievish officers,
And struggle to the death, before give up
Our share in man's eternal privilege
[Page 16]

Of mine and thine ; thus, fast establishing
A proud example unto scatter'd Jewry
How she may yet be terrible and free! Alph.
Fool! ye would sink in Christendom's great sea,
Like a few scatter'd rain-drops—dost thou brave us?
Not only will we have five hundred thousand,
But twenty times five hundred thousand crowns,
If so we need: look to your houses! Jew;
If we but think them pleasant—they are ours:
Look to your steeds and women!—they are ours,
If we but find them mettled to our liking:
The skin that covers ye is only your's
So long as is our pleasure! Thou may'st writhe,
Knowing our power still greater than our threats:
After to-morrow must the sum be paid,
By virtue of our edict, to the State;
If not, King Xavier! let your subjects look to 't. Xav.
O, my indignant heart! how canst thou hold?
Why dost not break— and send thy royal spirit ,
I'll-placed on earth, to seek its throne in Heaven?
'Tis true; 'tis true: we are defenceless men,
And outrage may do with us what she will! Alph.
[200]   Jew! Xav.
Christian! Alph.
Slave! Xav.
Ay—King. Alph.
Thou'rt idle, Xavier.—
Thou has a daughter; she is voiced for fair;—
Thou understand'st me, Jew?—she might do much;
But do not think to rail us from our purpose!                                          [Exit.
[Page 17]
Xav.
Daughter!—my daughter?—did he say it?—Daughter!—
As well we might, hanging a veil i'the air,
Think to secrete the fiery-beaming sun
From the amorous earth, as by impediment
Of fence and wall, keep beauty from men's note,
Towards it for ever prying. She hath dwelt
In solitude—to her no solitude,
Seeing her mind fills all vacuity
With notions and bright beings of its own;—
Or only with the serious of my tribe,
Who see no beauty save in holiness;
Yet Christian Lords have thrust them impudently
To her pure presence, shaming but themselves—
Her honor excellent as her's for whom
The Patriarch served a two-fold 'prenticeship:
And now, a kingly curiosity,
Smit with description, dotes on my pure child!—
[225]   I am unhappy now. Thou hast a daughter —
Thou understand'st me —and she might do much !—
O, filthy beast! as if my Rachel were
A courtezan, and lewd minx for the sport!—
Why, would he force her—as the Roman did,
I'd kill her by the shambles, rather than—
What was't?— She might do much !—I'll muse on that:
She might do much? 'tis not unlikely—much!
She might aspire to crowns—a Christian crown!—
She might be very Queen of Arragon!—
For with that glorious beauty of her youth,
And that high-pitch'd ambition she is full of,
[Page 18]

She might so queen it o'er the amorous King,
As to thrust by the feeble Isabel,
Make instant quash o' the edict, turn the streams
Of power and greatness towards her countrymen—
And Saragossa make Jerusalem!
All this might be; and, oh!—if all this were!
She loves her nation; is ambitious—well?
And her ambition's but a slip of mine—
Why should not Rachel be the Queen she looks?
Well! well!—my thoughts are very conjurors now!
Let Princess Isabel go home and weep—
Rachel shall be the Bride of Arragon! Enter Reuben . Reu.
Xavier, what news? we are impatient for't.
[250]   Your name did lend me entrance; what's the sentence? Xav.
Reuben, go thou unto my secretary,
And bid him straight write letters circular,
Warning our merchants to prepare the sum
Which the state calls for; and immediately—
For't must be paid; we have no remedy. Reu.
My share of't will go nigh to bankrupt me:
Beshrew the thieves! Xav.
I'll pay thy portion, Reuben;
So, get thee gone—and see the thing be done,
As I have told thee. Reu.
O, how well in this
Is shown thy kingly nature, royal Xavier!
Yet, 'tis extortion—well, my lord, I go:
I'd give them drachms of poison—not of gold!                                          [Exit.
[Page 19]
Xav.
'Tis fix'd! 'tis fix'd!—her aim shall be the crown—
And may the Guide of Israel prosper us!
Oh! well I know, she'll leap to my intent;
For she hath dreams of glorious destiny—
And I but hold a substance to her view,
For their proud spirit to fill and animate:
This deed's the child o'the time—and shall be done;
A Hebrew Queen must rule in Arragon!                                          [Exit. ACT THE SECOND. SCENE I. An apartment in Xavier's house. Enter Xavier and a Secretary. Xav.
Those letters have been sent to all the merchants? Sec.
They have, sir. Xav.
Very good: know you the hour,
And that precisely, at which the procession
Of Jubilee and Marriage—bless the Bride!—
Moves to the Temple of the Dam of Christ?
That is, sir—when begins our merriment?
For we will call it ours, seeing we pay for't. Sec.
'Tis named for twelve , but I should argue one —
Knowing these Christians to the hour do nothing,
Unless 'tis sleep.
[Page 20]
Xav.
And now it wants of ten? Sec.
Half of the dial. Xav.
I thank you, sir: you're free.
You'll not forget to send my daughter to me. Sec.
I'll tell her, as I pass her chamber-door. Xav.
That means, 'tis not a secretary's office
To do an errand to his master's child.
Ho! very well, sir;—tell her as you pass.                                          [Exit Secretary.
It follow'd me to bed, and kept me waking;
It crept into my sleep, and held me dreaming;
It rose with me at dawn, since nought else thinking.
And this day opes a page of destiny,
The turning of whose leaf must make all clear.
[25]   'Tis Rachel's footstep: I do know the voice of't—
Uneven and slow—a down-heart argument:
Her spirit lacks excitement—and shall have it. Enter Rachel . Rach.
What is your pleasure, sir? Xav.
To see you happy,
And therefore am I grieved to mark you sad;
To see you good, and therefore am I wretched
To think that goodness mounts not in this world;
To see you great, and therefore am I pain'd
To feel our greatness poor. Would'st thou be great?
Would'st thou have power? Rach.
Am I not Xavier's daughter?
Would I have power? My Sire, I have a power
I'm mistress of my soul—and she that is so
Is queen of a rich empire.
[Page 21]
Xav.
Then why sad? Rach.
Can I be merry, when my kinsmen groan
Under this new-awaken'd tyranny?
Can joy burn brightly in affection's eye,
When eyes she loves are tear-dropp'd with dull woe?
Should daughters smile, when noble fathers grieve?
Tell me that edict is annull'd, my sire;
Tell me that prelude to destruction's hell
Plays not for Judah's children—and my face
Shall tempt my father's lip to bathe in smiles:
[50]   My sorrow's but the shadow of your own—
Remove the substance, and the shade goes with it. Xav.
My precious Rachel! I do glory in thee
More than the Prophet in his Prophetess:
Thou art design'd for work miraculous;
And in thine inborn royalty of soul
And outward-worn nobility, I read
Annihilation of the King's decree,
Glory and power to Spanish Israel,
And vengeance full for every Christian wrong
Our patience hath bent down to. Rach.
'Tis my thought;
But by what magic can he read my thought? Xav.
Attend me, Rachel: yesterday, the King,
Giving that flat denial to my prayer,
Did leave me with— Thou hast a daughter, Xavier ;
Fame words her passing fair—she might do much;
And ended thus— Thou understand'st me? Xavier . Rach.
Well, sir: 'tis very strange! Did he say this? Xav.
As I have said.
[Page 22]
Rach.
And what should come of this? Xav.
If thou hast no great monitor within
That answers with a quick predominance
To that slow question, there is no reply
That could enhance conception. Rach.
[75]   O, make none:
Thou pluck'st the dream out from my inmost heart,
And show'st it even to my material eyes!
What? if my gifts of nature took Alphonso—
Have I thy leave to be a monarch's thrall? Xav.
I would rather kill thee—but,
Thou hast—to be a monarch's wedded bride!
Thou hast—to be the Queen of Arragon!
Thou hast—to turn the axe from Jewry's neck!
Thou hast—to raise thy fallen countrymen!
Thou hast—to do that, which if left undone,
'Twere treason to thyself, thy sire, and country! Rach.
Then, noble father! harken to me now:
I love Alphonso. Xav.
Love!—thou can'st not, dreamer:
Thou can'st not love whom thou hast never seen? Rach.
Sir, not long since, ere Isabel came hither,
I saw him, after martial exercise,
Returning to his palace; and his person,
Renown'd for majesty—with that fame coupled
Which showers thick laurels on his princely brow—
Did so bewitch my fancy-nourish'd heart,
That I have doated on his semblance since;
And tho' 'tis maddest folly—his near marriage
With foreign Isabella, grieveth me—
[Page 23]

[100]   As I were all defrauded of a hope,
Wild-fixed on the possession of my king! Xav.
In faith, dear daughter! some would think thee mad.
I see thou hast adorn'd thy hair to-day,
And that thou hast thy walking-mantle on—
What's in the moon?—Art for the Jubilee? Rach.
O, sir, decline not from that earnestness
With which you first did greet me on this theme!
The God of Judah in two kindred hearts
Hath lit one resolution; and to mine
Lent other feelings, to urge on resolve
To its last limit. Fare thee well, my sire:
This edict shall be void—and Israel free;
Or I am not the daughter of my lord,
But a base farmhouse trull, for nothing meet
Save the day's drudgery. Xav.
Yet, stay! my child:
Thou look'st not gracious with that mantle on. Rach.
O, sir, leave that to me. Ay, smile so still!
That Rachel from the spirit of her sire
May catch the very life of her attempt,
And urge her fortune's crescent to the full. Xav.
I'll see thee forth: our mutual heart is read.
Thy proud eye shows me, in an hour to come,
Jew Xavier's child a queen in Christendom!                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 24]
SCENE II. A Public Way. Enter Manrique and Two Lords. Man.
The Lord Alvaro, and his testy friend,
The Garcia, letting their self-wilfulness
Outstrip respect, have forfeited their place
In this day's state; whereat his majesty
Hath sent for your good honours, to fill up
The gap made by defection of those lords,
With nobler worthiness. 1st Lord.
We are much honour'd. 2d Lord.
And burn to show our duty to his Grace.                                          [Flourish of music at some distance without. Man.
They have left the palace, and are this way bent.
Our time is brief, lords, will you straight along?                                          [Exeunt. Enter Rachel , with veil and mantle. Rach.
The Queen of Arragon !—that's a brave title;
Alphonso's wife !—ay, there my heart were crown'd;
Deliverer of my countrymen !—if countrymen
I may call those who have been robb'd of country,
And make their home o'er all the desert world—
That were a glory of like eminence
With the male deed of Judith. Bless me, Heaven!
And make my hopes, in their accomplishment,
Thine own and Israel's glory: if I fail—
[Page 25]

Take back the breath of life thy pleasure gave me,
For Rachel then hath nought to do on earth.                                          [Martial music approaching without.
Hark! they draw near; and soon my tide of life
Must either flood to power, or ebb to death:
[25]   Hope's sun upon the dial of my days
Shows his meridian now—or there 'tis midnight
And unintelligible shadow all.                                          [Music near.
He comes! I see him move. O, regal grace,
How well thou sit'st upon the front of kings,
Picturing to earth a supreme majesty!
And fullest on the brows of Arragon
Thou glowest in thine excellence of pomp.
Why should that dame be there? Why should she not?
My head drowns in my heart, and reason gasps:
She pranks it royally; and yet, methinks,
I could outstate her, had I stately means.                                          [Flourish of trumpets without.
I'll shroud me, and stand by. Enter, in procession, King, Isabella, Manrique , Lords, Ladies &c. &c. &c. Alph.
O, good, my lords!
Ye fill up worthily a worthy place,
And bring no loss with change. On to the temple!
To celebrate the present with the past!
And praise and offerings accomplish'd there,
Remembrance of Toloza's prodigy
And expectation of sweet marriage-bliss
[Page 26]

Shall make the day and night triumphant reel,
Till mortal hearts pant glory spiritual!
Love plants a beauty in the heart of things,
And Fame doth color fresh old Time's grey locks
And make his wrinkle-covered forehead smooth!
[50]   On to the temple, ho! Rachel , advancing and kneeling. Rach.
Great Arragon!
A suppliant damsel, on her duteous knee,
Entreats a moment's passing audience:
Her life doth hang upon it; sire—her life! Alph.
Such urgency? Speak, lady; we attend:
A weaker adjuration scarce had staid us. Rach.
My liege, I am a maiden of that race,
Upon whose means of life—and, therefore, life—
Your edict shall to-morrow bear so hard;
And if no royal feeling in your heart
Crown Mercy with a power executive,
The fortunes of my kindred and myself
Go all to wrack. Have mercy, Arragon. Man.
When do you Jews keep Sabbath? Rach.
'Tis to the king I speak. Alph.
Such pleading well might win the thing it begs;
But to your people's idol, the Jew Xavier,
We have made final answer. Lead along. Rach.
Nay, at your feet, O King! I beg for mercy. Alph.
Lead on! I say. Rach. (starting up)
A moment yet, my liege
[Page 27]

Beggars in humble vestments prosper ill,
And mercy smiles on robes that frowns on rags—
Wilt hear me now?                                          [Throwing off her veil and mantle, and appearing in rich attire. Man.
[75]   That, by the gods! he will:
Xavier puts all his irons in the fire. Isa.
Why do we stay, my lord? Shall we go on? King.
Not yet—O, beauty!—grace unparallel'd!—
If that thou be'st a Jewess, I will swear,
Even by that mystery where our creeds divide,
There is no Christian in my kingdom like thee! Rach.
The edict, mighty king! Reverse the edict;
And here I kneel your grateful servant ever. King.
Nay—rather, sweet one! bid us kneel to thee.
O, such a flower should never stoop to the earth,
Save where she spreads her velvet lap to kiss it!
Thy name, dear maid? Rach.
'Tis Rachel, sire—a plain one;
Not so my parentage: 'tis Xavier's daughter
That bends before the king—low as her sire. King.
Xavier is wise. That fame which vouch'd thee fair
Spoke with a common and a vulgar mouth!
'Tis marvel that so rare a sun so long
Hath slept behind the cloud of privacy.
Thy beauty henceforth must beam forth i'the air,
And on the night of eyes rain heavenly day!
Xavier is shrewd—is shrewd. Rach.
Beseech your grace!
[Page 28]

Is my prayer heard? or must I profitless
[100]   Get to my home, and cry, heartbrokenly—
Alphonso has no mercy, O my father! King.
Lead on! my lords. Thy hand, sweet Rachel, come:
We'll hear of thy petition by the way.
Manrique, lead the princess. Isa.
Sir, I'll walk alone,
Since that the king hath chosen his company:
I marvel that your grace should think to wed,
Seeing you make so light of ceremony.                                          [Exit, with attendants. King.
Thou art a dangerous suppliant. Rach.
Nay, my lord. King.
And yet, it scarce may be: let me hear more—                                          [Exeunt King and Rachel , and all but Manrique . Man.
O yes, my liege—it may be; all may be:
Kings that make law, make lawful. So, so, so!
I would not wager on these nuptials now,
And least of all would stake my head upon't:
Alphonso is a true man-weathercock. Enter Xavier behind.
My court-wise cue shall forswear razors, faith!
And bless the twice-six tribes of Israel.
The bait is taken; if he gorge the hook,
To which he's apt—O, ho! I know the man—
I see small reason underneath the sun
Why Rachel should not step in Isabel's shoe,
And Xavier (bless us!) be first minister
[Page 29]
Xavier (advancing and tapping Manrique on the shoulder.)
Suppose he should? Man.
[125]   Is't you, sir; did you speak? Xav.
Suppose he should be what you say, my lord
(For you're a lord, sir—I believe, a lord)
Do you not think he'd whisk the flies away
That in the court's best sunshine make a pest?
Would you begone, sir? Man.
Sir, I serve the nuptial,
And but neglect my duty, lingering:
Pardon me, noble Xavier. Xav.
Sure, my lord.                                          [Exit Manrique .
The fawning of this Christian argues well.
'Twas excellently done! she stood in clouds,
And doff'd them like the Deity of Day,
When he aspires to his meridian!
I saw him grasp her hand: 'tis well; tis well.—
I know Alphonso: he is ta'en by the eye,
But scarcely held by the heart; yet much may come of't:
My Rachel is his kingdom's paragon;
And such as she build empires in men's breasts
That grow convulsion-proof!—There's peril in't—
But sooner shall the sun lack living warmth,
Than Rachel the all-holy fire of virtue!—
There is no canker in the healthy bud!—
So, from such peril, if such safe things come
As freedom, strength, power, retribution,
[150]   Unto God's chosen thro' wide Arragon—
Peril's more safe than safety.—Expectation!
[Page 30]

Thou broodest like an eagle in my heart,
Ready to soar i'th sun.—Hush! here's a wave
That frets at what it chafes on! this is joy.                                          [Retires. Enter Garcia and Alvaro . Gar.
My lord, the king is at his pranks again;
Those ill demeanours which take awe from crowns:
The Jewess stood beside him at the altar,
Whilst at the holy Mary's sacred shrine
He offer'd up six standards of the Moors,
Won at Toloza; and so parley'd with her
With the broad meaning of his libertine eye,
That the indignant princess veil'd her state;
And unperform'd the nuptial ceremony—
She left the Temple, weeping. Alv.
What! not married?
The plighted honor of Alphonso's vows,
Made to her royal sire's ambassadors—
And the just dignity of Arragon,
Damn'd by a vulgar Jewess!—Like you this?
'Twill not end here. Xav. (Apart.)
It shall not, by my soul! Gar.
Sir, I do not; and very joyful am I
That we threw up our places when we did;
Else had our honours suffer'd, in allowance
[175]   Of the king's insult to grave decency
In this proceeding, which shall outrage quite
The intercourse of nations; and, 'tis like,
Set Christian against Christian, whilst the Moors
Yet triumph in our country—O, 'tis foul!
Our glad successors will have little envy.
[Page 31]
Alv.
Faith! none, for me; my life unto a dog's—
That edict will not hold! Gar.
Nor would I have it: 'tis a tyranny
I never loved, to mulct particular men
For a state's service—and in her endeavour
Rachel is, so, praiseworthy. Alv.
Tut! she's a strumpet! Xav. (Coming sternly forward)
That's a foul lie! my lord—a filthy lie! Gar.
Keep back your sword! wouldst draw it on a Jew? Xav.
I say, a wicked lie! an abject lie!—
Were all your honours ten times multiplied,
Your titles swollen as an Eastern king's,
Your riches vast as ocean's, and your power
Next even to His that breathed the universe—
I'd tell you, tis a lie!—my daughter's pure!—
Not all the banded kings of Christendom
Could o'erthrow the high empire of her virtue!—
You know it, Lord Alvaro—you, you know it:—
She spurn'd you when your lordly vanity
[200]   Approach'd her with a coxcomb's confidence—
And she had slain you, had you dared too far!
You know you've spoke a lie!—a foul-mouth'd lie Alv.
Had I my will, I'd make thee carrion,
And give thy flesh to hogs. Xav.
Thy house their sty?
Look to your own flesh, lord; it may smart yet. Gar.
Jew! thou dost wax surpassing insolent
[Page 32]

And I can somewhat see into thy soul;
But if thou think'st, by thy fair daughter's means,
To pave the way for Jewish influence
And lord it o'er one inch of Christendom,
I say to thee, beware!—the end is, blood! Alv.
Ay, by the saints!                                          [Exeunt Garcia and Alvaro . Xav.
Why, then— blood let it be!
A term of power is all that man can have,
Let power be long as life. But—my sweet child?
They would not tread to earth that blushing flower?
They would not flaw that precious diamond?
Not drag death's cloud athwart that living star?—
'Twould be a way to kill me; but, too cruel:
No! rather than a Christian's hand should shed
The royal current of her Jewish blood,
My own should do't, tho' doing were perdition!
Why do I tarry, when that bark's afloat
[225]   Of which I must be pilot? Well? good Reuben. Enter Reuben .
What wondrous devil of joy possesseth thee? Reu.
Thou'rt Israel's saviour , Xavier; ay, her fence,
Her prop, her staff, her rock of adamant!
I'm drunk with joy, I'm foolish—mad with joy!
Thy daughter hath obtain'd a full release;
Jewry rings with it—the sore edict's null;
'Tis nought, 'tis quash'd—we've nought to pay at all!
[Page 33]
Xav.
Praise be to God! deep-hearted praise to God!
Not for the 'scape from impost—but, from shame. Enter a Messenger. Mess.
The king salutes you. Here are papers, sir,
With which I was proceeding to your house:
And this he says; at your most speedy leisure,
He would be pleased to see you at the court—
From whence the lady Rachel greeteth you. Xav.
I will come speedily: Heaven save you! sir.                                          [Exit Messenger.
It is the written cancel of the edict:
Go with it, Reuben; get it multiplied;
And let it have quick circulation
Throughout all Saragossa—that our triumph
Be read by every eye that conn'd our shame. Reu.
That will I, straight. But this is joyful news!                                          [Exit. Xav. (Kneels.)
I thank thee, Israel's God that thou hast made me
The guardian of the least part of thy people;
And if thy pleasure will her rising now,
[250]   In Jewry's greatness shall thy glory mount—
Temples shall rise to thee, and Israel sing
Her Alleluias , as she sang of yore!— (Rises)
Back, soul! to earth: I must be courtier now:
Alphonso yet shall have the sum he needs;
Ay, and from Christian coffers. Nought's to fear:
Her soul is arm'd in Virtue's adamant—
That the most trenchant sword of giant Guilt,
[Page 34]

Daring to strike, breaks idly into splinters!
Now, then, for policy!—Ay, it shall be—
That foreign princess must not thwart my child:
Ambition, take thy scope!—I'll hold nought done,
Till Rachel be the Queen of Arragon!                                          [Exit. ACT THE THIRD. SCENE I. Near the Palace. Enter Garcia and Alvaro . Gar.
This Hebrew madam makes our Arragon
Her pleasure and her spoil: all bow before her;
People and nobles lacquey her alike,
And the mere crown is all she wants of Queen :
Nay, men already name the Hebrew Queen ,
And Xavier sways the nation's ministry.
Alphonso in his dotage is gone mad,
And his proud kingdom uses as a toy
To please a wench's fancy; yet she stands
In honour unassailable—that the King's passion
Must die, or end in marriage. Alv.
Marriage! Gar.
Ay:
The lady Isabella is despised;
As if she were a garment half outworn,
And not a bridal robe, trimm'd for the wearing—
[Page 35]

But ne'er put on. Be joyful, Arragon!
Your Queen's a Jewess. Alv.
Would to Heaven's God!
My feet were on the upstart Xavier's neck;
His daughter in my arms—I'd teach them both
What honour is! Gar.
I thought them unoffending—
Peaceful; but give them claws and fangs, I find
[25]   They'll tear like other brutes: it shall not last!
Jews shall no longer be the chiefs of state,
And mock our Holy Faith with blasphemy! Alv.
They shall not, by the Cross!—they shall not, dogs!—
What! Jews make levy upon Christians? pluck
Our fortunes from us—Now, by all the Saints!— Gar.
What royal sorrow's this strikes pity mute
With witchcraft of its tears? The beauteous princess? Enter Isabella . Isa.
I can endure no more: I've suffer'd long;
Letting the duteous heart of loyal love
Beat 'gainst the sense of injury; and now—
After calm brooking of so many wrongs,
Now to be banish'd, now!—it breaks my heart. Gar.
Banished! O, gracious madam, speak again
The king is not so clutch'd in by the devil,
As to do this? Isa.
He frowns me from his presence;
Xavier looks death upon me as I pass,
And Rachel—there is poison in the name!—
Insults me with the triumph of her smile.
[Page 36]

I'd rather live on roots i' the wild woods,
Than thus beside a throne!—my honour'd lords,
I here commend my fortunes to your care:
Take me where'er you will—I reck not where;—
Back to my father's court—to exile, death!
[50]   No future sorrow can exceed the past! Gar.
O, royal lady! your good cause is ours.
We will avenge thee; and thy royal sire,
Shall need to stir no foot in thy behalf.
Be this your comfort, the Jew strikes himself
And this presumptuous levy he hath dared
To make on Saragossa's citizens,
To serve his daughter's fast extravagance,
Fells him to earth: resistance is on foot;
Alphonso's troops are out against the Moors;
The city shall rise arm'd within the hour—
And her ten thousand voices thunder death
To the proud Jewess and her upstart sire! Alv.
Ay, and to every cursed Israelite
That taints our kingdom's air with villainy:
How the Jew dogs will howl!—I hear them now. Isa.
Amaze and joy burn brightly in my heart,
But apprehension's breath doth shake the flame. Gar.
He shall be hurtless; and his dignity
In our revenges will but rise renew'd
From its long cloud of slumber: rest content!
Please you await the issue, in my house
Of this great blow for justice, to which shelter
A troop of friends shall guard your royalty. Isa.
Even be it so, my lords: what else should be?
[Page 37]

[75]   My bliss and greatness in their infancy
Have sicken'd, at the least—and well may die;
Would I might too!—death is not misery.                                          [Exeunt. SCENE II. A room in Xavier's house. Enter Xavier and Reuben . Xav.
The Christians rise against it, and my power
Sits quailing now: that courier was despatch'd
At sunrise, was he not? Reu.
He was, sir; even at dawn. Xav.
And with him bore that signet of the king
I furnish'd stealthily? Reu.
He has it with him. Xav.
On that man's speed, the fortunes and the lives
Of all of Israel that's in Arragon
Hang as in agony. Swift be his horse!
For tho' he do out-gallop the wild wind—
Fly like a leaf along the hurricane,
He shall not ride with that rapidity
Our need cries out for. I've one more resource:
The princess fled the palace; she's waylaid,
And in an hour shall be my prisoner,
Despite the guard of Garcia, unto whom
I know she goes for refuge: then, my child
Hath her life sure; or a fair princess bleeds for't. Reu.
A bold manœuvre!—thou art ever sage. Xav.
Summon a thousand of my well-arm'd Jews!
Let them surround my house, that once encaged,
The royal bird escape not: see it done!
[Page 38]

I'll to the palace, ere the storm comes on:
[25]   The rabble will scarce dare molest their king? Reu.
I'll have the thousand station'd in an hour. Xav.
In less! in less!—an hour is half an age,
When in an hour life with all time may part!                                          [Exit Reuben .
I've been too sudden: I had thought my power
Grew with a deeper root, than thus to bend
So crouchingly to the first storm that rises
To threat its branching sovereignty. Awhile,
And Rachel had been Queen of Arragon!—
The very marriage-day was fixed in secret!—
This hasty levy, by the king and her
Urg'd 'gainst my better sense, looks perilous:
God grant it prove not Israel's overthrow! Re-enter Reuben . Reu.
Xavier, the multitude surround the palace,
Headed by Garcia and Alvaro:—well?—
Some cry Alphonso! Xavier ! some—some, Rachel !
Death to the Jews ! shout some—(sharp plagues upon 'em!)
O, we are lost; all our rich profits' gone:
We shall be flay'd of our great fortunes now. Xav.
Silence! base, bearded merchant: hast thou summon'd
Some thousand friends, as I commanded thee? Reu.
Ay; they are mustering now. Xav.
Quick let them be!
I'll seek no palace, then! but gaol a princess;
And tho' a Rachel outweighs twenty such—
[50]   One royal life may be the bond of her's.                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 39]
SCENE III. A Chamber in the Palace. Tumult without. Enter Rachel , in dismay. Rach.
Alphonso! Xavier!—O, my king! my sire!
Haste! or your Rachel shall be trod upon
By rebel lords and base mechanic churls.
That fatal measure is the cause of this;
And Xavier's wisdom augur'd prophet like.— Enter Manrique , hastily.
Save me! Manrique; guard me! counsel me!—
Is there no shelter from this hideous death? Man.
Madam, I scarcely can advise myself:
To your own prudence, therefore, I commend you;
Which, if it save you, is miraculous. Rach.
Out of my sight! thou shadow of a man:
Thou art an arrant coward, Lord Manrique—
And never coward was a woman's friend! Man.
Call on the king—perhaps he'll serve you, Madam;
For I must fortify your enemies. Rach.
Away! thy weakness shames the weaker side.                                          [Exit Manrique .
They come! they come!—What ho!—Alphonso, ho!—
The voice of Rachel can allure no more. Enter Garcia and Alvaro , followed by a crowd of citizens, with drawn swords. Gar.
The king's secure: Alvaro, seek the Jew;
And I will deal with this gay upstart here. Alv.
I'll rest not, till he's shorter by the head!
[Page 40]
Rach.
O, he is guarded by the omnipotent God!
Thou durst not slay him, thou false Christian lord!                                          [Exit Alvaro , with a party of Citizens. Gar.
Jewess! repent thy sins, and pray to Christ,
[25]   And make thy choosing between Heaven and Hell;
For thou must die. Rach.
'Tis false; I must not die:
Thou art too noble, Garcia, on my soul!
To slay a woman that ne'er injured thee. Gar.
Traitress! that art a curse to Christendom,
Kneel to thy fate! Citizens (advancing)
Strike down the traitress—strike— Alph. (rushing in)
Villains! stand back: here, Rachel—in my arms!—                                          [She struggles into his arms
Use stronger bolts, Sirs, when ye'd gaol a king!
Now, valiant gentlemen! now, loyal subjects!
Strike your bold daggers to a woman's heart,
Even thro' the breast of your anointed king! Enter a Lord . Lord
Rescue, my lord; the royal Isabella
Hath been waylaid and taken by the Jews:
Such is the cry. Gar.
Ha! Citizens (without)
Slay him, spare him not! Enter Reuben , through the Citizens. Reub.
I will come thro', though dagger-stuck!—a porcupine!
[Page 41]

Lay not a hand upon my master's daughter;
Molest her not; harm not the pride of Judah!
Your Isabel is fast in Xavier's hands,
And dies, if one of you but touch his child! Rach. (breaking exultingly from the king)
Who stirs, to stain him in that Isabel's blood?
Rachel hath left her shelter; kill her now!
[50]   O, my great father, how thy master-spirit
Hath ta'en this giant danger by the throat,
And laid it breathless! Christian gentlemen,
What think ye of our Jewish policy?
Your daggers! come, I will not flinch at all! Alph. (advancing, and taking Rachel by the hand)
Be silent, Rachel; this cannot endure:
I am awoke now from a perilous sleep,
Which I have past in luxury of dreams,
Neglecting the realities of life;
Ever in absence from the battle-field,
Where Christian glory springs from Infidel blood;
And leaving Arragon to be controll'd
By hands which, by her birthright, she abhors.
List to me, boist'rous and rebellious men:
By my great ancestor, The Battailer,
Who on these towers install'd triumphantly
The ever-blessed and eternal Cross,
We swear ye shall have justice: sheath your swords. Gar.
'Tis all we seek, my liege: put up your weapons.                                          [They sheath their swords. Rach.
Parley with traitors? Is this King Alphonso?
[Page 42]
Alph.
Be silent, Rachel: you have said too much;
And that you utter'd 'tis resolves me now.
We speak, Sirs, from our justice, not our fears:
Our levy on your fortunes we recall;
And henceforth your own loyal loves shall tax you,
[75]   Unto our need's nought overstrain'd extent:
We pardon your rebellion; and yet more,
To show in all indulgent sovereignty,
We banish from the soil of Arragon
Xavier and all his Hebrew tributaries;
Ay, every Jew and Jewess in the land;
She not excepted, in whose banishment
Our joys are exiles: Rachel, get thee gone! Gar.
O, royal Arragon, we kneel before thee;
And gratefully thus offer up our hearts
Unto your majesty, for this free grace,
Which so shall strengthen you in subjects' love,
That all the world will cry of Arragon—
Behold a king, now, fenced with adamant! Alph.
Arise, my lords; there is no more to beg:
But learn ye—not one drop of Hebrew blood,
In execution of our stern decree,
Must there be shed: this look to, on your lives! Gar.
My liege, it shall be heeded faithfully;
So flow in health the blood of Christendom! Alph.
Go then, my lord, and hush the city's heart
Before it heave to bursting; and take order,
You and my lord Alvaro, both of whom
We reinstate in your high offices,
[Page 43]

For the Jews' banishment. What is there more? Gar.
[100]   All shall be done as you command, my liege!
And from the Hebrews will we rescue her
Who should be your throne's grace—the gentle princess. Alph.
We did not speak of that; but do your will.
Leave us; our word is past. Gar.
Heaven keep your grace!                                          [Exeunt Garcia and Citizens. Alph.
From his own passions and you worthy monarchs;
For now Alphonso is his subjects' subject:
Where is Manrique? What dost stay for, Jew? Reub.
To do my bidding to lord Xavier's daughter;
And not for all the kings in Christendom
Will Reuben budge a foot, till she desire. Alph.
And art not gone? Why should'st thou tarry, Rachel? Rach. (waving Reuben off)                                          [Exit Reuben .
She that doth sleep in sunshine, amid flowers,
Woke by the riot of the hurricane,
Or the dread-volley'd thunder, shrinks within
Her inmost self, and trembles; but not moves:
'Tis so with Rachel, sire. Alph.
Oh! quit my sight:
Thine eyes are treach'rous beacons, towards which steering, I,
That am the royal pilot of the state,
Do wreck the state, and all my freight of glory,
And am nigh drowned in the perilous sea.
Tempt me no more; but if Alphonso's fame,
[Page 44]

The quiet of the realm—nay, thine own life,
[125]   With that of thine all-too-ambitious sire,
Which falling in one scale, make love-griefs light i'the other,
Have any heed from thee, forsake me now:
Be to my eyes, as if thou ne'er hadst been;
Or, at the most, a thought-made-visible dream
Of some sweet past. Begone! speak not a word;
Lest that thy witchcraft make a perjurer of me. Rach.
Alphonso is a king. Alph.
And being a king,
Must look he forfeit not that loyalty
Which holds him kingly. Rach.
He is not a king
That hath not the prerogative of kings.
Alphonso hath not; every upstart subject
Plants his base will above his sovereign's;
Says thus and thus his pleasures shall be shaped—
Thus shall he walk, eat, sleep, and thus be clothed;
Thus shall he speak; thus see. Know this, O king!
My father hath more royalty than thou;
For many tremble at his beck and nod,
And none dare dictate to his word, or deed. King.
Our doting love for thee hath darken'd us,
And set him shining in our cast-off state:
Thou dost speak haughtily. Away! Rach. (falling at the King's feet)
Never!
[150]   By all thy vows of love, my royal lord,
When thou hast named me thy soul's inner spirit;
When thou hast call'd me thy dear Hebrew queen,
[Page 45]

And sworn thy state's crown, as thy life's, was mine!
I do implore thee, drive not from their homes
My ever-persecuted countrymen;
O, scatter not those bees, hived in thy kingdom,
Expelling them from all their labour'd store,
To perish in the barren winter-air
Of stranger lands—O, do not, gracious sire!
I will go forth, the sacrifice for all;
And in atonement for that envied little
Of power which we poor outcasts have enjoy'd,
I will die starving in some wilderness—
Ay, in the worst of deserts—the drear waste
Of all mankind's abandonment; but spare—
O, spare my father and my countrymen! King.
You rack my heart; Rachel, it cannot be:
It is to save their lives I have done this,
And thine—more dear to me than all. Away!
Thou shalt hear of me, Rachel; do not fear it;
And yet our marriage shall be solemnized!
And thy pure, honor-guarded beauty shine
The star of Arragon!—Yield to the time,
And go at once: this passion tortures me! Rach.
[175]   Yet hear me, sire: by thy own dignity! Alph.
Tempter, away! I'm powerless; and my will
Comes not within the account: I prithee, hence.
Manrique, ho! Raph.
Is't final? Am I spurn'd? King.
O, get thee hence, sweet! and preserve thy life,
And leave Alphonso of his love to die:
[Page 46]

'Tis in our destiny; 'tis fix'd—go, go.
Manrique! Rach.
I will plead no further—no!
Xavier, disdain not thy too grovelling child,
That hath forgot her dignity and thine,
By crouching to this Christian. Sir, I go;
And leave thee to that lowest slavery
Which the earth knows, the slavery of kings
To their mechanic subjects . 5 Thou hast kill'd me;
Absence will be my death; and my wrong'd shade
Shall haunt thee in thy camp and cabinet,
In thy void state, and on thy slavish throne!
I'm the world's exile, banish'd to the grave;
Banish'd by thee, who vow'd to shelter me
From all the plagues of body and of soul
Engender'd by the elements and man.
My grave shall give forth an eternal voice
Of torture to thy heart! O, cruel king!
[200]   Thus to turn from me: I can ne'er brook this.
Come, welcome death! for nothing now is left
To Rachel in this cold and desolate world.                                          [Exit. King.
She's gone; and my bow'd crown sits firmer here:
Another breath of passionate entreaty
Had made me violate my force-wrung oath,
And bent my sceptre to the crack of breaking.
Would I had left the Moors sans molestation,
[Page 47]

And kept my troops at home! Never let monarchy
Forego its guard; power's slip is death to will:
The lesson learn'd shall be remembered,
And on the near'st occasion, practised too. 6
Manrique, ho!                                          [Exit. SCENE IV. Within the grounds of Xavier's house. Enter Garcia, Alvaro and Citizens. Alv.
No blood? Gar.
Their banishment suffices; not a drop;
I'm pledg'd for't to the king; nor break my oath,
Come of't what may. Alv.
I'll tell thee what will come of't:
Xavier hath garrison'd his house with Jews;
And we, in our attempt upon his life
Have been defeated, wounded, driven back;
And, look! the infuriate Hebrews are upon us!
No blood, did'st say? Gar.
No drop! I swear, my lord. Enter Xavier , followed by Reuben and other Jews, armed. Xav.
Stand! till I bid thee strike—be not too hot.
Out of my gates, ye Christian woman-slayers!
On whose ferocious hearts, nor streaming locks,
Lustrous as sun-set, nor heaven-kindred eyes,
Nor dew'd-rose cheeks, nor beauty-breathing lips,
Love-rounded bosom, nor the delicate hands
Of ladies, clasp'd and trickling piteously,
[Page 48]

Washed by the tears of anguish; ye, whose hearts,
All these—that well might move the brutes o' the wild—
Move not at all—out, out of Xavier's gates!
Or shall his garden-flowers drip with your blood? Alv.
Thou damned Jew! thou royal, righteous dog !
So perfectly I hate thee, were thy life
[25]   Cased in by mine, I'd pierce it to come at thee!
Down with him! citizens; set free the princess! Gar.
Hold! by the virtue of mine office, hold!
Xavier, thou know'st the sentence of the king:
Thy servant, Reuben, will have told it thee. Xav.
Sir, I know many things, which though unknown,
My soul would not be more unalterable:
Time must we have to move to banishment,
Time must we have to render up the princess;
And in the gap of time, oft chance is thrust,
To prove fore-knowledge futile: where's my daughter? Gar.
Safe, sir; for us. Xav.
I thank my captive—safe:
When she is in my arms, I'll talk of ransom.                                          [Noise without. Enter Rachel . Rach. (As if speaking to the rabble without)
Dare not to follow further, filthy scum!
Ye common dirt! ye cannot soil me now:
Lo! I take shelter in a father's arms. Xav.
Go, drive them from my gates!                                          [Exit part of the Jews.
Here rest thee, child;
[Page 49]

And like a wild-flower, on this sheltering rock
Smile at the storm! Rach.
I do, my lord; I do. Gar.
My Lord Alvaro, by my honor—no!
I raise my sword against it; I have sworn. Alv.
Turn Jew—I care not. Christians, rush upon'em
[50]   There is no fence 'gainst charms, the witch alive—
Kill her! and ye are safe. [They advance to kill Rachel—Garcia restrains them. Xav.
Base blood-hounds, back!
Molest her with a touch, a breath, a glance—
If I but wave this hand to yonder point,
Off goes your Isabel's head! Now; who will stir?                                          [They fall back. Alv.
Cowards! Gar.
I thank ye, citizens: proud Jew!
Now, hear the sentence; three days and their nights
Are given ye to depart from Arragon,
With all that ye possess; that time expired,
If aught remains of Hebrew property,
It falls to the state; and those that linger, die!
And more, know this: if by to-morrow's sun-set
The royal Isabel be not rendered up
In health and safety, not a Jew shall live;
For we will lead the banded citizens,
With sword and fire, to slaughter and consume
Ye and your habitations. Xav.
If I yield her,
'Twill be in safety, Christian; but, for health,
[Page 50]

I cannot answer for her highness' health. Gar.
Well, Jew; look to't: my deed pursues my word;
And once again, I warn ye to beware,
For ye stand verging on a bloody death!
[75]   Lead hence, my friends. Alv.
Garcia, attend my word—
You'll grieve for this forbearance, speedily. Gar.
Sir, I have sworn an oath. Lead hence, my friends.                                          [Exeunt Garcia, Alvaro and Citizens. Xav.
Follow them, Reuben; treble-bolt my gates;
And there hold watchful sentry thro' the night. Reu.
I will, I will: O, noble Xavier, trust me—
Reuben could weep, could weep with very joy,
To see thee and thy daughter still preserved
To be the fence and pride of Israel!
If but that messenger keep up the gallop,
Our sun to-morrow may rise very cloudless;
Let him ride so; and after, break his neck—
He cannot live to do a better thing. Xav.
Amen ! good Reuben. Friends I thank ye all.                                          [Exeunt Reuben and Jews.
Rachel! Rach.
My father? Xav.
Come, arouse thee, daughter:
Thou'rt very pale and very silent, Rachel;
And I part fear the verdure of thy soul
Hath been much blighted by one passing storm;
That resolution in your woman's heart—
By love and high ambition palaced there—
[Page 51]

Is somewhat reeling from her constancy:
I should be loath to deem thee feeble, girl. Rach.
[100]   I've been upon the dark brink of the grave;
A hundred swords were thirsty for my blood—
And death, think what we will, is terrible—
I have been hurl'd from a most mountainous
And giddy elevation of delight,
To the low valley and drear depths of woe;
Arragon's King and Rachel's high heart's god
Hath shut me from his throne and from his heart;
I look'd to wear a crown, where now are ashes—
My father and my countrymen are doom'd
To horrible exile; I'm in hourly fear
Even for his honoured life, their lives—my own!
O far from wondering to see me faint,
Sire, thou should'st marvel that I live at all! Xav.
Is this the fearless Rachel, Xavier's daughter?
The pure descendant of great Israel's Kings?
The chosen of Heaven to raise her countrymen?
O, then, indeed! the time is come again
When that our wives and daughters, cattle, homes,
Our very skins, are Christian property—
As once Alphonso said—for which I hate him!
Hate him, as I would have thee hate him, Rachel—
Thou should'st not love that foe of Israel. Rach.
O, would I did not love him!—'tis my heart
That, beating, shakes the fix'd strength of my soul. Xar.
[125]   Daughter! bethink thee, how sublime we stand;
The beacons whereby many thousand lives
Direct their sail for safety, if we suffer
[Page 52]

Our light to be extinguished—O, bethink thee!
The bark of Jewry will be wreck'd for ever. Rach.
What should be done? Xav.
This should be done, Blest Rachel;
At early morn seek audience of the King;
Kneeling, with tears and passionate entreaty,
Made by thy beauty heavenly eloquent,
Plead, till relenting he recalls his sentence
Of banishment against us. Fear not; that
Necessity of which he makes a merit
And grants whate'er his riotous subjects would,
I will subvert, if fortune wrong me not;
And a most inwardly-prophetic spirit
Tells me we triumph!—that the crown is thine,
If thou dar'st snatch it!— Rach.
It shall be attempted;
And on the event hangs Rachel's life, or death.
For, sire, she could not brook a second downfall—
And such would failure be; I will attempt it! Xav.
Ay; and if any virtue live in prayer,
If any blessing in a righteous cause, 7
Thou'lt issue from the attempt fair-garlanded
[150]   With all the flowers of praise that crown success.
Let not thy love aught blind thy patriotism;
But gaze on Jewry with clear-seeing eye,
Till she on thee doth glance triumphantly!
Meantime, I hold the princess prisoner,
[Page 53]

For warrant of thy safety. Dear! let's in:
We'll turn this banishment to firm estate,
And the sweet bird of our prosperity
Shall sing high songs again: the world shall know
My Rachel doth but rise from overthrow!                                          [Exeunt. ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE I. A chamber in Xavier's house, with a casement, overlooking the Ebro. Enter Isabella and an attendant Jewess. Isa.
Kind girl! thou cheer'st the sorrows of my prison;
And of a princess hast the affections won,
By delicate attentions—such as make
Happiest life swifter, and sad days less slow;
I'll think the better of thy race for this
Long as I live; or Jew, or Christian—
In the kind heart grows true fidelity;
And amiable virtue has no creed
And owns no sect. I thank thee, gentle girl. Jew.
Madam, that service that rewards itself,
Takes thanks, for bounty too superfluous:
[Page 54]

Would I could do your grace more benefit! Isa.
And that thou may'st, perchance. Now, leave me, dear!
For I have many thoughts that should be lonely.
I'll call thee if I want thee: love me, girl. Jew.
Tell me to love myself—there is like need.                                          [Exit. Isa.
I might not think, with Rachel's hated name,
Form, voice and feature in my memory,
I e'er could love a Jewess; but this maiden
Hath so heart-dew'd my hours of solitude
With tears and smiles of kindness, that my nature
Turns answeringly to hers. O, much the need
I yet may have of her sweet charity!
The morn advances; and the Ebro glides
[25]   Beneath my casement, free and happily;
But, ah! not so the river of my life!
How is't I still am here? close prisoner
To the stern upstart of a race despised,
When that the honor of the king and nobles
Goes with my freedom? I imagine all things,
And knowing nothing, am bewildered. Enter Xavier . Xav.
Your pardon, madam; is your highness well? Isa.
Impudent Hebrew! What's my health to thee? Xav.
More than your grace would dream of, credit me;
And so I have come early to enquire:
[Page 55]

Whene'er my daughter's safety ransoms thee,
Lord Garcia the redemption sanctions not,
If thou be sick: I pray your grace, keep well. Isa.
Am I to be a base Jew's merriment? Xav.
Madam, I once was yours; the wheel's gone round:
But, did you know what news of life, or death
Is moving toward me on the dial's hand,
You'd wonder at my mirth. You're very fair:
I marvel that Alphonso loves thee not;—
But then, my daughter's beauty is a flower
That outblows all Spain's garden. Yet, you're fair. Isa.
How I despise thy vulgar triumph! Jew;
Thee and thy daughter utterly despise!
And the king's fault shows more unworthily
[50]   In loving her, than in rejecting me.
Take off thy rude glance from my person, Jew!
And tell me how thou dar'st with thy vile hands
Chain here a Christian princess! Xav.
Indeed—'tis bold. Enter Reuben . Reu.
The messenger is back; and at his heels
Compliance with the mandate which he bore
(By the king's signet witness'd from the king)
Is moving rapidly. Xav.
The passions'-plaything,
Expecting life, or death—receiving life,
As I do now, would laugh, weep, leap, fall down
And rend the welkin with his ecstacy!
But I will tarry till a silent hour;
[Page 56]

And then kneel down, and lift my joy in praise
And prayer unto the king of Israel!
Madam, I've that will carry me abroad;
But this, my kinsman and my faithful servant,
Will render thee all dues of ceremony,
That may beseem your state. Reu.
Madam, I will. Isa.
I'd rather be attended by a bear,
Or the most hideous ape that screams i' the wild,
Than this thy vulgar, bearded infidel!
I'm prisoner at the peril of thy life;
[75]   And prayers for vengeance from a royal lip
Rise not in vain to Heaven! I'd be alone:
Thy death will free me—and my freedom's near.                                          [Exit. Xav.
Death being freedom, dame, it may be near.
Reuben, be vigilant; she flatters thee—
Let thy attentions mark thy gratitude.
The city was most quiet thro' the night—
Was it not, Reuben? Reu.
Nought of tumult stirring;
And not a Hebrew, nor a Hebrew's house
Did suffer molestation. Xav.
The more safe,
Christians and Christian dwellings. Be thou watchful! Reu.
If she escape from Reuben, I will forfeit
That Reuben's life—his monies! which is more.                                          [Exit. Xav.
Now, I'll go haste my Rachel to the king:
Those lords, I know, have had conditions drawn
Of government, the which 'tis their intent
[Page 57]

To force Alphonso sign: this shall work well,
And gall resentment; then my daughter comes—
And that's approaching which shall lend him power
To wreak his vengeance and his love to the height;—
Then, where's the cloud that dare shut out my light?                                          [Exit. SCENE II. A room of state in the palace, with throne &c. Enter Alphonso and Manrique . Alph.
Conditions! what conditions? Back! Manrique;
Say that the king will seal to no conditions
That chain the free hand of his government:
We will not see them; we are busy—sick;
Feign what excuse you will. Man.
Your majesty
But holds your greatness at a just account,
Not to let subjects dictate: place is place;
And those who know not, must be taught the rule
Of each man in his sphere . I'll tell my lords
Your majesty is indisposed to-day. Alph.
Tell them, we will not listen—'twill suffice.                                          [Exit Manrique .
Oh! Rachel—thou wert born to be my curse,
Even as my bliss—a honey that is poison;
Thine absence weighs so heavy on my heart,
That all cares else fall on me scarce perceived.
O, for my troops! my troops!—Small ceremony,
[Page 58]
Enter Garcia and Alvaro .
Insolent lords! Alv.
Not hear thy ministers!
My liege, 'tis needful, then, we force the leave!
The tempest intermits—'tis not o'erpast. Gar.
But in the grace of your great Majesty
Lives that shall make it harmless: in this parchment
There stand engross'd some small indulgences
[25]   Of rule and privilege to lords and people—
Subscribing which, restoring the wrong'd princess,
And putting in full force the Hebrews' doom,
My liege in the rich circle of his crown
Resets the jewel of his people's love. Alph.
Certes, 'tis fit the people be indulged:
Perchance, they'd use our chambers and our gardens,
To eat, and drink, and take their pleasures in?
Be sure they shall; “indulgence” is the word:
Trench'd they upon aristocratic power,
What would my lords say then?—then would it be—
‘Vile herd,’ the ‘common nothing,’ ‘idiot brutes;’
Now 'tis ‘the people’—and, ‘their majesty’! Alv.
Will't please your highness sign the instrument? Alph.
Ay, without reading, sir— a royal custom . 8 Gar.
Not so, my liege; I do beseech thee, read;
And seeing the great need and wisdom of't,
[Page 59]

You'll grant without ado. We'll leave you, Sire,
And to your prescence render us anon,
To know your further pleasure. Alph.
As you will.                                          [Exeunt Garcia and Alvaro .
It is as if the oak bow'd to the bushes!
There's not a slave in all my Arragon
So slavish as the King of Arragon!—
Let's see this instrument—Oh! flower-sweet Rachel,
[50]   Would thou hadst pleaded more! then hadst thou triumph'd;
And tho' thy triumph had been death to both,
Still death is peace to this intense desire,
Whose fire is its own fuel. O, come now!
And snatch my sight from this vile document—
Wherein I read the downfall of a king,
Written by menial hands—to thy proud eyes,
Wherein my soul hath ceaseless coronation! Rach. (Entering by a secret door)
The spring is faithful of this secret door—
And here I stand, like to a sudden spirit,
Unheard—unseen. 'Tis he! I cannot speak. Alph.
In thy full beauty glance before me now!
Step like a seraph from the veil o' the air!
And I will tread this parchment to the earth,
And own no sovereign's sovereign but my love! Rach.
At my lord's wish. Alph.
I am a sorcerer!
The spirit I invoked is conjured up!—
Rachel, I see thee near, and love thee near;
[Page 60]

But yet this parchment falls not from my hand,
And no excessive joy posseseth me:
But grief, quick grief, and apprehension sad;
For what can come of this, tho' thou be here? Rach.
My liege! three days are given us to depart,
And one is gone; that, two brief days are left
[75]   For me to part with all that's dear on earth;—
My native Arragon, to whose Christian soil
My soul clings with a fondness that's religion;
My cherish'd home; my morn and evening haunts,
Where my ambition lit me to my love—
My love to my ambition; and, oh! torture—
From thee, the royal monarch of my heart,
In whose most regal splendour I so bask'd,
As to shine sovereignly with borrow'd light:
Two little days!—Oh! let me use them, king;
Else is no joy left in eternity. Alph.
Thy sire goes with thee. Rach.
Ay: heaven shield us both!
O, my dear lord! upon thy lips but now
Was heavenly music, that did utter love,
Tranced to adoring, for unworthy me;
Or else my ear was cheated; or my love,
Pining into delirium, dream'd it heard;
You call'd on me—I came—and sure, to stay? Alph.
For ever! were Alphonso that he was;
But all things meet to urge thy speedy flight
From Arragon and death: what should I be— Rach.
A king! sire; be a king! dare to assume
That high prerogative of ample will,
[Page 61]

Which is a monarch's birthright; let not slaves
[100]   Rebel not only 'gainst your hand, but heart;
Hold your affections free; love whom you will;
And wear again your exiled dignity,
Redeeming her you love from banishment! Alph.
Life of my heart! O, know you not, my word,
My pledge, my truth—the honour of a king,
Are seal'd upon the sentence? Dearer yet,
Your safety and your life are centred in't. Rach.
At length, I feel my pleading is in vain;
Poor Rachel's heart may break—Alphonso cares not:
Thus, then, I spend the value of my life—
Come, death! but never, hideous banishment!                                          [She draws a dagger, and offers to stab herself. Alph.
Give me the dagger—desperate creature! give—
Thou wouldst be Beauty's beauteous suicide.
I will revoke the sentence, come what may!
Oh! let my crown and sceptre rot i' the dust!
I'll change them for a cap and simple staff;
My robes for a grey vest, and my proud throne
For the rush chair whereon the cottager
Sits the most happy king of his own heart:
There will I reign—and thou my empire, Rachel! Rach.
To the most barren desert—the drear'st cave
That foreshows hell's feign'd gloom upon the earth,
I'll follow thee! if need; and thou shalt still
Call me thy Hebrew queen . My heart's a spirit! King.
[125]   What have I said? I am the woman here—
[Page 62]

And hold for real the sweet things I dream:
It cannot be; the sentence must stand firm;
Against the nobles and the people join'd,
What power have I?—My troops are far away—                                          [Martial music at a distance. Rach.
Ha! King.
Is't imagination?—God of War!
Thou steel-invested and life-wasting Mars!
Thy truant son bows homage at thy breath.
Those trumpets thunder'd o'er Toloza's fight,
When I from thee won high appellative!—                                          [Music nearer.
Is the sound spectred in the atmosphere?—
Dream I?—It peals again! My troops are here!                                          [March continues: part of the troops enter, pay homage, and line the apartment—then: Enter Xavier . He kneels, and places the King's signet and the mandate for their recall, in Alphonso's hands. Xav.
Have I done well? King.
Bold Jew! didst thou do this? Xav.
Monarch! thy servant did: hath he done well? King.
For which thou shalt have honour all thy life;
Thou hast the art to make a king a king!
If now our subjects feel the yoke of rule,
Let them not wince—they've taught us tyranny.
Call in our court!—We reinstate thee, Xavier,
In thy high office; and our rebel nobles
Cast to the dust! thy people we set free
[Page 63]

From doom of exile, and their wealth and persons
Fence with protection of this warlike state. Xav.
[150]   For which, their hearts shall bless Alphonso's name;
Their hands speak thanks with deeds, when he commands—
And heaven look down in grace on Arragon! Alph. (To Rachel .)
Kneel not! for thou art greater than thy king. Enter Courtiers.
Most welcome, each! Dearest, to your high place!                                          [He leads her to the throne.
Bear witness all! to Rachel we commit
Our crown, and sceptre, and sway absolute;
Whilst we take rest from cares of government:
Obey her as ourself—thus on our seat
Throned in the pomp of queenly majesty!
And know 'tis our intent, in fitting time,
To wed and crown her Queen of Arragon. Xav.
First, let a father kneel!—not to his daughter—
But to the delegated majesty
Of this great kingdom: who dares otherwise?                                          [ Xavier and Courtiers kneel. Rach.
Will you not sit, my lord? Alph.
Nay; reign alone:
Thou shalt be absolute! And now, fair queen!
Power dominant of Arragon—to this,
This parchment of conditions, this base clog—
Meant to restrict the birthright of my crown—
Fix thy disdain: the lords return anon;
Give them such answer as befits the king
[Page 64]

Reigning in thee. Alphonso 'waits thee, Rachel:
This is his heart's day of half shower, half sun;
[175]   And thou its rainbow, that with glorious beauty
Gives covenant of joy—sky-tinted hope,
That lives in the sun of things.—Away! my lords:
Take order for the chase!—Bird pleasure now
Shall mark that sadness crawls, and wonder how.                                          [Flourish; exeunt King and part of the Courtiers and Soldiers; the rest remaining, in attendance and guard, with Rachel. Xav.
A silence, felt as that which broods i'the stars
In moonless heaven, falls on my daughter's heart;
A cloud of glory shades her. Ho! my lord. Enter Manrique . Man.
Madam, my lords, the Garcia and Alvaro,
Await the audience. Rach.
Is't to me you speak?
Who is't that speaks? O, I remember thee—
And now my soul soars living to her place!
Art thou not he, who when a woman cried
On thee for succour, in an hour of need,
Didst cowardly skulk aback?—Art thou not he? Xav.
Sweet Rachel, sure not he?—he's very brave. Man.
Madam, it was a fault; and all my life
Hereafter dedicate to your sweet service,
Must make amends for't: I am awed before you;
And that divinity of nature in you
Constrains me even to worship. Rach.
Even so?
Out of my sight!                                          [Exit Manrique .
[Page 65]
Xav.
They come! my enemies come!
[200]   O, what a triumph sits wing'd upon my heart!
Daughter, be all thyself—I'm at thy side.                                          [Leans on the throne, at Rachel's righthand. Rach.
Thy blood is in my veins; and a king's sceptre
In my firm hand. Enter Alvaro and Citizens. Alv.
Thy faithful subjects, sire—
Now, God of Heaven ! what infamy is this? Enter Garcia and other Citizens. Gar.
Hath the king signed—O, Garcia's eyes are mock'd!
His sight's the fool of fear. Rach. (Rising)
What! are ye stone?—
Do ye not know me?—I am Xavier's daughter—
Rachel, the Jewess!—not your queen, but greater!—
She that's omnipotent in Arragon!—
Acts with Alphonso's power—speaks with his voice!
Alvaro, look on Xavier!—thoud'st have slain him;
Garcia, thy coward sword was at my heart;
I fill a guarded and despotic throne—
Do ye not quail with terror? Alv.
Gods! gods! gods! Gar.
That this should be! Rach.
Ye are degraded, lords—
Pull'd down from your high places!—And to this—
This insolent-writ rebellion, this vile breath
Raised 'gainst the sky of power, this petty scrawl—
Thus I make answer as befits the king
[Page 66]

Whose greatness speaks by me; thus, in the dust!
[225]   Low as ye shall be, Christian murderers!                                          [Dashes the parchment at their feet.
Now, get ye hence! and dread what is to come!                                          [Descends the steps of the throne, as going. Xav.
Most noble Christians! why, ye stand amazed!
Three days ye gave us to depart, my lords;
We had been ungrateful not to use them well:
The princess I will not give up by sunset—
That's she you'd have for queen—so, sword and fire
And banded citizens must serve ye now,
To kill poor Jews, and burn their silent homes:
I prithee, set about it—and by times,
Lest that ye lose the advantage—loftier necks
Have crouch'd beneath the tread of Israel!
Vengeance, long sleeping, shall now wake for ever—
And shake her red locks in the face of wrong!
Attend us, ho! My royal daughter, come! [Flourish; exeunt all in due array. Garcia, Alvaro , and Citizens remain, standing in wonder and confusion. Alv.
Why do we stand like statue-gods in gardens,
Stock and stone-still, as if we had not hearts! Gar.
This master-policy of that Jew king—
That plague of Arragon! whose ambition
Climbs by the ladder of his daughter's beauty,
Hath stricken me dumb with marvel: they must fall!
We not believed the trumpet when it spoke—
But, lo! the troops are come. They must both die!
[Page 67]
Alv.
And quickly: let's about it!—matters now
Come to this point—'tis Jew , or Christian ! Enter Manrique , with a paper. Man.
[250]   I grieve to be so black a messenger:
This dooms my noble lords to banishment
From ground of Arragon. Farewell, my lords:
My prayers shall not be idle for your safety. Gar.
You're a base lord. Alv.
A Hebrew wench's lap dog! Man.
'Tis but a sweet variety of air!
Mine is a surface from which rough things slip
As well as gentle—save your courtesy!
So I but prosper, and maintain my place
(A touchy matter, as your lordships know)
My heraldry's nought tarnish'd to the world.
Ye're worthy nobles: may ye better know
The gentle humour of prosperity!                                          [Exit. Alv.
Hang him! Gar.
Let each man draw his sword—and here
Kneel with the Garcia, and to righteous heaven
Swear or to die, or cast out to the dogs
The Hebrew and his daughter: kneel—and swear!                                          [Drawing his sword and kneeling. 9 Alv. and Citizens (idem)
We swear! Gar.
Listen! Alphonso hunts, ere long,
Some leagues from Saragossa, it is said:
[Page 68]

The soldiers (I did note it heedfully)
Frown with a deep and sullen discontent,
That scowls aversion to this Hebrew yoke:
[275]   The king away, they're ours! Now, with the Jews
Soon comes a day of highest festival;
And to their temple one and all will throng—
And Xavier, as their chieftain and high priest,
With his proud daughter—even the Hebrew Queen —
Be sure, will there make show of his stolen pomp,
And vaunt the greatness of his ministry
In (what he calls) the eyes of Israel. Alv.
Our quick thoughts meet: we, with the citizens
Will gird their temple, and destroy them all! Citz.
All! Gar.
Utterly! else not a Christian's safe;
And we shall soon be butcher'd in our beds:
This doom of exile is a speaking prelude.
The princess' escape is plann'd; and sight of her
Shall strike the people into phrensy! Come:
Ere many suns shall set, we're dead—or free!                                          [Exeunt. ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE I. Isabella's apartment in Xavier's house. Isabella and the Jewess at the casement. Isa.
Sweet wench! look down the stream—I would see hope
Come toward me in the likeness of a boat,
Mann'd by the Garcia and the Lord Alvaro
[Page 69]

And some half-score of loving citizens,
That in my bondage feel themselves enslaved:
Look down; for I have strain'd my eyes in vain,
Even to the stretch of aching. Jewess.
Nought see I, Madam. Isa.
The letter you convey'd to me said six ;
That point the dial's shade past long ago—
Ah! me—I fear things have gone contrary. Jewess.
A speck flits in the distance, like a mote;
A dark spot in the light—now light gleams on it;
Now 'tis a flying thing, with oars for feathers! Isa.
It is, it is the boat! the oars strike fast,
But, oh! my heart strikes faster; and so fast,
The rapid bark, shot faster every minute,
Seems slower ever minute. O, sweet boat!
'Light 'neath this casement with a swallow's flight—
And I'll dart down as with a merlin's wing!                                          [Noise without.
Keep the door fast! What's that? Jewess.
Alas! dear lady,
Your jailor's stirring, and the guards are roused. Isa.
Keep the door fast!—The boat's a tortoise, sure:
[25]   I'm seen; they doff their plumes in homage to me:
It flashes nearer now;—and now—and now,
They anchor close, and silently beneath:—
I thank thee, God!                                          [Noise without. Jewess.
Haste, madam—haste Isa.
God bless thee!
[Page 70]

Be sure that I will love thee, gentle Jewess,
Ever for this; and place thee near myself—
If ever I be queen. Jewess.
Heaven guard thee, lady.
O, haste!                                          [Noise without. Isa.
A kiss! farewell. A couch is spread—
I cannot sure take hurt; and tho' I do,                                          [She gets out of the casement.
Worse harms are here; so, courage!—dear, farewell!                                          [She drops outside from the casement. Knocking without. Jewess.
Reuben is at the door:—she's safe! she's safe!
And now the boat is struggling 'gainst the tide;
They hoist a sail in the fresh-blowing wind—
And now, it flies! it flies!                                          [An alarm is given without. Knocking. Reu. (without)
Open the door! what, ho! Jewess.
The alarm is given—and all is doubtful yet:
They'll slay me in their wrath; but welcome, death! so met!                                          [Exit. Noise and knocking without. SCENE II. A Chamber in the Palace. Enter King and Rachel ; he attended, as departing for the chase. Rach.
Alphonso, I beseech thee, go not forth:
To-morrow, if you will; but not to-day—
[Page 71]

O, not to-day! A dark, mysterious feeling
Clouds o'er my heart; and even now I seem
As I were standing on the hideous verge
Of some deep, blood-wet grave: what 'tis, I know not—
Or fear, or augury; but something 'tis
That deep-pervades my being: do not go! King.
Thou wert a dreamer ever, my fair Hebrew:
The spirit of thy Prophet Ancestry
Lives in their dear descendant. What's to fear?
The rebels now are powerless and abash'd;
Thy sire is with thee—and my faithful guards
Hold thy throned greatness unassailable:
'Tis a rare morning for the gallant sport;
And 'twill be pleasure to me; with me, the chace
Is a mad passion—like my love for thee.
Thy fears are folly, Rachel. Come, my lords—
Thou'lt better keep thy Jewish festival;
I should but drag thee from devotion, sweet! Rach.
Upon my knees! upon my knees! dear lord. King.
Nay, rise! my peerless Jewess: what's the fear? Rach.
Those banish'd lords are mighty in the hearts
Of the whole city: even Alphonso's guards
[25]   Lower on his Rachel with a scowling eye;
And if dark looks could do the deed of swords,
She had been dead e'er now. And, oh! my king,
My brain hath in the night been tortur'd
By such a hideous real-seeming, dream,
That, on my life! 'twas more than visionary.
[Page 72]
King.
A dream! a dream! Why, now I mark thee, Rachel:
Calphurnia had a dream— Rach.
And Cæsar died!
And Rachel had a dream—and Rachel dies,
If thou, Alphonso, dost go forth to-day! Enter Manrique . Man.
Your courser, my great liege! strikes up the ground,
'Till the air startles with an upward shower
Of grass and dust: he stands magnificent!
And with a tossing head, champing the bit,
And his mane shaking like a cloud i' the wind,
Reproaches royally his royal lord—
Delaying high enthronement on his back:
The dogs make music; and the huntsman's soul
Frets in his eye!—Will 't please my liege to mount? King.
You come in time, Manrique. All to horse!
Sweet Rachel, we will hear thy dream to-night,
And thou shalt laugh then at thy now affright.
Come, come!                                          [Exeunt all but Rachel . Rach.
He's gone—and my misgiving heart
[50]   Shakes with the palsy of some ominous fear:
It is as he had left me to fall back
Into my grave! Unlock my tears, dear God!
That I may weep this burthen from my soul:
I must behold my royal lord again? Enter Xavier . Xav.
Why weeps my daughter in her pride of power?
[Page 73]

Why weeps the Hebrew queen of Arragon?
Go, deck thee for our holy festival:
Israel expects thee in her joyous temple,
There to preside—her glory visible!
What sorrow is the fountain of these waters?
Tell me, my queen. Rach.
'Tis felt—not to be told.
The king e'en now hath left me for the chase. Xav.
That's leaden sorrow! You grow tame, proud lady. Rach.
All brows bend on us with suppress'd disdain:
The very soldiery, power's common tools,
Scowl on thy daughter and her lofty sire—
As they did wish their swords were in their hearts. Xav.
A potent fear! were wishes sharp as swords:
I do begin to weary of thy terrors;
Thy love hath made thee very simple, Rachel. Rach.
Sire! you have credence in the might of dreams;
And of the mightiest, one hath shook my soul. Xav.
Frail fret-work of the brain!—Yet I do listen. Rach.
[75]   Thou stood'st before me in a cloud of fire—
Which left thee; and all then seem'd black as night;
But thou wert still most clearly visible:
And then there came a dagger to thy hand,
And thou withal didst pierce me thro' and thro';
Each stab was a life-losing agony!—
That I did shriek, and shriek; and at my feet
The king lay dead, as thou hadst murder'd him,
Thro' wounding me: then rose the cloud again,
[Page 74]

In likeness of Alvaro—who did clasp
And burn thee, till thou wither'dst into ashes;
Which I fell down and kiss'd—and kiss'd; and waking,
Did almost feel them on my feverish lips! Xav.
I prithee, go; and in the inner chamber
Of the great temple, 'wait thy father's coming. Rach.
Sire, I would fain remain here in the palace:
I have an ill-foreboding soul, that tells me
There's danger in our going forth to-day. Xav.
Not go? not worship?—Stay at home for fear?
To Jewry—and more foul, to Christendom
Make proclamation that our power is air?
For fear, insult the God of Israel!
And with neglect abuse his ordinance?
Go!—that is well; else wert thou not my daughter.                                          [Exit Rachel .
Dreams have been warnings to our tribes for ever;
[100]   But I were happy, if this dream were all:
Those proud lords' banishment stands unenforced;
There walks a lurking peril thro' the streets;
Men's souls look thro' their eyes, and sullenly
Speak of a deed to come. I've learn'd a truth:
Our sun hath shone! the weight of the world's scorn
Is heavy on us, that we cannot rise;
Or rising for an instant, cannot stand:—
And 'tis a truth that makes me wish to die.
And yet, sweet Rachel! I would live for thee;
Live to maintain thy greatness with that genius
That's strong in Xavier's soul. Still have I power:
Let citizen and soldier hate their fill!—
[Page 75]

They dare not strike, whilst at my dagger's point
I hold this Christian princess.                                          [Enter Reuben , bleeding and faint.
The misery? Reu.
My life and the small riches I possess
Are forfeit all—my life's half gone already—
Pluck out the rest!—the Christian is escaped. Xav.
Death seize thee wholly! Dar'st thou say, the princess? Reu.
Kill me! 'tis so. Xav.
Now, Xavier's curse fall on thee!
Thou wert concerting some low scheme of gain;
She made a loophole of thine avarice!
Hadst thou brought news that half the world was drown'd,
[125]   'Twere tidings of a jubilee, to this!
The strong-hold of our power, our certain safety,
Thy care hath turn'd to utter foolishness.—
Get thee away! The curse of Israel on thee! Reu.
I bleed, Sir; and had fought unto the death,
Could it have aught avail'd—but she escaped:
I slew the trait'rous wench that aided her!
It chanced in this wise— Xav.
Ay; it chanced: suffices;
No need o' the history; 'twill mend no marring.
Get to the temple! and there 'wait my coming. Reu.
I'd to the surgeon's—but I'm fain to die.                                          [Exit. Xav.
Our downthrow is afoot—and that proud laurel
I planted loftily, that it might spread
[Page 76]

Over a kingdom, withers with one leaf!
But this, at least, shall be a day of glory
And pomp and triumph to all Hebrew hearts:
The troops shall gird the temple; and the king
Be summon'd from the chase—or live, or die,
The soul of Xavier fareth royally!                                          [Exit. SCENE III. A Public Place of Assembly. Enter Garcia , Lords and Citizens. Gar.
You left her highness safe? A Lord.
In a good citizen's house,
Recovering from the terror and fatigue
Of the morn's perilous doings. Gar.
At her sight
The popular heart will throb exultingly,
With uncontrollable passion—all must die! Enter Alvaro and others. Alv.
All! all!
Rachel is in the snare; and the cursed Jew,
Clad in his priestly vestments, even now
Enter'd the Temple: there the troops are placed;
But, with a fierce reluctance, one and all
Wince 'neath the gall of Hebrew government:
By St. Iago! they'll not stir a man! Gar.
Is the king forth? Alv.
An hour ago. Gar.
Enough!
Quick; let the signal-bell of Mary's Church
Peal death to every Jew in Arragon!                                          [Exeunt some.
[Page 77]
Alv.
Great glee, great glee is in Alvaro's heart!
I long to grapple with these scoundrel Hebrews. Gar.
My country! wipe the sorrow from thine eye;
Mantle thy native cheek with native smiles—
Blush out thy pleasure!—and from Jewish graves
[25]   Start up again in Christian liberty!                                          [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Jews' Temple, with an Altar &c. Rachel discovered, leaning on the Altar. Rach.
There is a peace and holy quiet here,
At variance with my spirit, which it lulls not:
The shadow of some lowering ill falls on me,
Arguing the substance nigh—O, what's to fear?—
That horrible dream! 'tis on my vision now;
And like the ghost o' the murder'd, will not vanish!
Ha!                                          [Confused noises in the distance. The signal-bell rings.
That dull bell seems tolling for my death—
There's tumult in the streets, and in the temple!
What should the meaning be?—is the end come?                                          [The bell ceases. Tumult within. Reuben staggers upon the Stage. Reu.
Daughter of Xavier! fly—i' the instant, fly!
The Christians are upon us, and the soldiers
Join in the slaughter. Curses on my head!
Ten thousand, thousand curses on my head!
That let the princess 'scape: she stands on high,
Setting their hearts on fire with gazing merely!—
O, get thee from this place!—
[Page 78]
Rach.
Whither? Oh! whither? Reu.
I'm gashes; and my tears are drown'd in blood!
Nay, they weep blood for thee—O, thou art lost!—
Life and life's goods
Are gone for ever—all is night with Reuben!—                                          [Falls, so as to be concealed by the Altar. Rach.
O, mercy! God of Israel—mercy! mercy!                                          [Noise of a bolt falling. Enter Xavier , in his Priest's habit. Xav.
'Tis bolted; and a breathing space is left us.
[25]   Rachel, our hour is come; think on thy soul,
For it must straight to Heaven: this being fades—
Even now the consciousness of life's half gone,
And at the portal of Eternity
Darkly we stand sublime. O, what a terror
Stares in thine eye!—Scion of Israel's kings!
Fear'st thou to die? I've heard thee speak of death
As of a pleasing and an intricate maze,
Leading in mystery to mystery,
Even to be coveted: how is it now?—
Thy soul is dead already! Rach.
Horrible! horrible!
My love hath made me coward—Oh!—'tis fearful:
'Tis cruel, now to die—in youth to die—
Ere a grey hair is on my head, to die!—
Is there no hope? Xav.
In Christian daggers—Ay! Rach.
The king? the king? Xav.
A name—my child! come; come.                                          [Noise at the door.
[Page 79]
Alv. (without)
Break ope the door! I saw him enter here. Xav.
Ay, bloodhounds!—here. Now, Xavier's royal daughter!
Wilt thou be slaughtered by these Christian butchers—
Be mangled by a pack of citizen dogs—
Hold out thy throat to raging Garcia's sword—
To base Alvaro, stung by loathed lust—
[50]   Writhing with thy disdain, ope thy pure heart;
Or wilt thou perish freely—like a queen—
By thine own fearless deed? Rach.
Give me the means!—
And, oh! no blood—let it not be in blood! Xav.
Men whom each hour may call upon to die
Must wear strange armour: drink!—it is death's wine.                                          [Gives Rachel a phial of poison. Battery without. Gar. (without)
It will not ope; bring other instruments! Rach.
Villains! I fear ye not: a desperation
Makes me immortal! Sire, I drink to thee.                                          [Drinks the poison.
My dream! my dream!—O, speedy remedy!—
I've dearly loved Alphonso, O, my father;
And I do fear, with love that almost quench'd
That higher love—my country; thine, my glory.
We've reign'd! 'tis something: all is over now.
Thou see'st how calmly I do bear this torture—
Thou'lt follow—Oh!—so; so; past suffering—
My soul's asleep—the king—                                          [Dies.
[Page 80]
Xav.
There Xavier's life
Gasp'd into dumb oblivion! this rough frame
Holds not his being; but in thee, thou fair
And exquisite image of the living god! 10
He breath'd, and moved, and joy'd. Cold! cold! my child;
No fire is on the altar of thy beauty;
Thy lips are idly ope, for balmy breath
[75]   Of sighs, nor sweet word-music, ever more
Shall pass from their deep-crimson—poison'd—pale;
Thine eyes, that shone so gorgeous with rich light,
Where the soul dwelt, a clear and visible thing,
Are—my tears rise—I see not what they are.
The holy pressure of a father's kiss
Seal up thy lips!—their venom poisons not,
O'ermatch'd with sweetness. Here, even here, dead saint!—
Even at the altar's foot, sweet Hebrew Queen!—
Lie tranquilly, and holy as itself—                                          [He lies the body upon the altar-steps.
And I'll kneel down, and pray.                                          [Cries without—and noise as of the door bursting open.                                          [ Garcia, Alvaro , citizens and soldiers, with drawn swords, rush in: Xavier starts up.
Ha! Murderers:
Lo! ye are spared your honourable work;
Great hearts have privilege to choose their death!—
Now, bloodhounds! are ye happy? Look! look there!—
[Page 81]

What! naked weapons still?—ye'd slay a woman—
And on the senseless flesh of the fair dead
Would haply vent the manhood of your valour!—
Out! ye are worms! Gar.
The Jew hath kill'd his daughter!
My soul is struck with pity: let him live—
Live, to make legal answer for his deeds. Xav.
Live! Alv.
Drag him to a dungeon! he shall know
What 'tis to rear a Hebrew commonweal!—
[100]   He, the sole Jew that lives in Arragon! Xav.
Stay! gentle Christians—even for charity;
I'd once more kiss the dead lips of my child.                                          [Kneels beside the body.
Ye see—I weep; the Jew—the proud Jew weeps;
See, that he feels almost as Christians do.
God bless thee! and sweet peace attend thy soul!                                          [Starts up.
Now, ye inhuman dogs! leave ample space
For the great exit of a mighty soul!                                          [Draws a concealed dagger: they shrink back involuntarily.
The last of all the race of Israel's kings
Passes from earth to heaven—his passport, this!                                          [Stabs himself, and falls on his daughter's body.
Ye are baffled, dogs!—I'll die on thy hush'd heart,
My gentle daughter. Faith! I once did dream
Of building up a new Jerusalem
Here in this Saragossa; and had visions
[Page 82]

Of Israel's resurrection: but, 'tis past—
Yet will her full hour come—hear it! 'twill come.                                          [Dies. Alv.
A villain dead! Gar.
A noble nature dead!
The king! my lords, the king! Alv.
Come! let's beg grace.                                          [They all kneel. Enter Alphonso, Manrique and attendants, followed by Isabella and attendants. Alph.
I come too late: ye shall all die for this!
Oh! Rachel—my heart's life! What! dead? quite dead?
All winter where I left a glorious spring?
Here will I lie by thee, and rave for ever—
King of no realm but sorrow!                                          [Throws himself by Rachel's side. Isa.
[125]   Methinks it were a happy lot to die,
To be so mourn'd. My intercession, lords,
Tho' weak, shall go between ye and the king,
When this his fearful violence of grief
Calms into tears. Here am I dedicate
With patient love his lost peace to restore;
Or, still disdain'd, I'll be as now are seen
The Jew of Arragon—the Hebrew Queen.                                          [The curtain falls. Back matter

Full text: HIGH WAYS AND BY WAYS: A FARCE, In Two Acts,
[Page ]
Front matter
REMARKS. High Ways and By Ways Laughter is the great end of farce. Like the Quaker's advice to his son, “Get money honestly if thou canst —but get money”—if, by his wit and humour, the dramatist can make his audience merry, well and good—at all events, he must not be over nice about the means to attain the end . Mistakes and blunders are greater provocatives to broad grins, than well-drawn character and witty dialogue,—shall we blame an author for using that which is readiest at hand, and the most likely to insure success? As soon should we uncork Champagne when Gooseberry is preferred; and satiate a glutton with dainty bits, who had been wont, like Subtle , to banquet—

                                         “At Pie Corner,
Taking his meal of steam in, from Cook's stalls.” We can imagine nothing more humiliating, than to submit the toils of genius to the ignorant cavilling of vulgar minds; for, to adopt the words of the great Milton, as significantly quoted by the honest Ritson, one must always “ Abominate the censure of rascals .”
The author of High Ways and By Ways has said, “Let's have a laugh , and (like Pat when he called for his whiskey) d---n the expense!” Two French pieces have been laid under contribution, “ Mons. Rigaud, ou les Deux Maris ,” and “ Partie et Revenche .” Much credit is due to Mr. Webster (a very rising and intelligent young actor and respectable man) for his skilful management of these materials—he has not translated them word for word, but adopted the ideas rather than the language of his originals. Mr. Charles Stapleton, a prudent young gentleman, being desirous of knowing something of his mistress's good qualities, previous to marriage, resolves to pay his first visit in the disguise of a traveller seeking hospitable entertainment—this comes to the ears of the lady, who, in concert with Mrs. Primly, an ancient housekeeper of peculiar susceptibility
[Page 6]
and size, determines to play him trick for trick. The day is dark and tempestuous, with a disagreeable accompaniment of sleet and snow—a Traveller is announced— he is ushered into the mansion with due form— the servants are commanded to show him every civility—a fowl is placed on the table, into which he eagerly sticks his fork, and, having ascertained its identity, exclaims with joyful certainty, “Hang me, but it is a fowl!” He is asked which wine he will please to drink—white or red? A little of both ! and he moistens every savoury mouthful with a glass of each alternately. To the obeisances of the servants he returns appropriate congees; invites one to pick a bit with him, and another to hob and nob in a bumper of blackstrap.—His feasting is interrupted by the entrée of Mrs. Primly:—their surprise is mutual—the traveller's, at encountering a gentlewoman of such portly dimensions— and the lady's, at beholding a pretty poppet, that she once dandled on her knee, grown up to a warlike-looking dandy, booted, whiskered, and dressed in an incongruous jumble of second-hand finery. She inquires if he be not the handsome Mr. S. that is expected—ambiguous question! True it is, that his name answers to that mysterious initial; and his physiognomy, ( Liston is the personater!) decorated with an orthodox brace of captivators—anglice , mustachios, belies not the insinuation of beauty.—He is the handsome Mr. S.! being no other than Mr. Narcissus Stubble, straw manufacturer, on an expedition for orders; travelling a la militaire , to command respect, and on the eve of celebrating his hymeneals with Miss Susan Plat, a young lady in the straw-bonnet line, to whom he has entrusted the care of his moveables and every other valuable, himself only excepted! A smart equivoque ensues, in which Mr. Stubble is told that the lady of the mansion, rich, young, and beautiful, is his intended bride, anxiously waiting his arrival, to invest him with full and absolute possession of the splendour that surrounds him. Narcissus is thunderstruck, yet lacks not the wit to discover that he has tumbled into a good thing, and resolves to turn to the best account the honour that has been so unexpectedly thrust upon him. He discards Miss Plat, and adopts Miss Gordon—issues his ordinances with ludicrous pomp, and assumes all the airs of lord and master. Now for the ceremony
[Page 7]
of introduction:—Miss Gordon starts at the odd face, Monmouth-Street dress, and queer attitudes of her lover; for Stubble had resolved to be interesting, and we all know when Liston has made up his mind to a conquest, it is “ Veni, vidi, vinci .” The upsetting of a stage-coach introduces two new personages on the scene, Mr. Charles Stapleton, and Miss Susan Plat— the one to pay his promised devoirs, the other to look after her runaway swain. Miss Plat suddenly recognises the well-known travelling-bag of her Narcissus; and Venus felt not greater trepidation at the sight of the fatal boar that killed her darling Adonis, than did Miss P. at this interesting moment.—His voice is heard giving the word of command; and she is thrown into a direful fit of rage and jealousy at being told that the owner of that voice is the destined bridgroom of the lady of the mansion. Her face grows as red as her riding-habit— the room is too hot—'tis as close as a cottage bonnet! How she longs to trim the recreant Narcissus! Mr. Stapleton and Miss Gordon are introduced to, and become enamoured of, each other—Mr. Stubble passionately demands who is that green-eyed monster? the nose of Mr. Stapleton being made the supporter of a pair of green spectacles.—Various are the incidents that follow—a sham duel, the tables turned, lovers changing partners, and a round of extravagance and fun that are the essence of farce;—in the sequel, the lovers are properly paired, and Narcissus Stubble wins his mistress, though he loses his mustachios.
This is purely a Listonian farce—those who desire to see this lion of low humour in his altitude must not fail to come and stare him out of countenance . His inexpressibles were a pleasant satire on the vulgarity of fashion; and will doubtless prove a check to that low taste which requires but the sanction of some dandy ruffian, to bring into general adoption. Mrs. Orger, in Miss Plat, was highly entertaining—her trade similies were given with good point; nor must Miss S. Philips pass unnoticed, for her exceedingly well-chanted ditty and unaffected and lady-like air.—Mrs. C. Jones, in the susceptible old housekeeper, was eminently sentimental and fubsy.

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. —An Elegant Apartment in Miss Gordon's Mansion—door, C. F., a door R., another door, L.—a window, R. U. E., through which is seen the country, covered with snow—a fire-place, and fire lighted, L. U. E.—a table, L. C., another table, R. C.—four chairs, &c. Enter Eliza Gordon and Miss Primly , R. D. Eli. (C.) Heigho! well, Primly.
Miss P. (L. C.) My goodness! well, indeed! 'tis not well, I think, miss, to be moped up here, where nobody ever knocks at the door, where nobody ever comes near enough to do so, as if it was haunted—where we are breathing our beauties away in the desert air.
Eli. How my heart beats! Five hours have elapsed since I arose this morning, and no one has arrived yet— oh, dear!
Miss P. Eh! whom do you expect?—Since your aunt died, twelve months ago, and you made me come and reside with you in this immense mansion-house, where one is cut off from all matrimonial speculation, like a nun—a thing I never was used to—no chance of seeing a male in this cross-road place—my goodness! I have given up the idea of such a thing; and yet you are so monstrously impatient to-day—
Eli. True, Primly, true; you know there are times when one cannot account for certain odd sensations—
                                         [Crosses to R. Miss P. Odd sensations! my goodness! I've odd sensations from morning till night: this solitude will be the death of me; and you, you'll die of the fidgets—I always consider the devil's tattoo as the first summons to heaven—ah! if you knew what it is to remain a miss [25]   so long—not but what I might have been married three times, if I had liked.

[Page 10]
Eli. Primly—
Miss P. Yes, miss, my last chance was in ninety-eight. My goodness! I have seen everybody comfortably settled, and I still remain Miss Primly.
Eli. [Sighing.] Heigho!
Miss P. My goodness! that's very like a love sigh.
Eli. I will tell you—I am—oh, dear!
Miss P. Well, what?
Eli. I am momentarily in expectation of the arrival of a husband.
Miss P. Husband! you've taken away my breath! [Aside.] I couldn't have been more surprised if I had been married myself. [Aloud.] But how, miss? when, miss? where, miss? and pray, what kind of man, miss, is this invisible husband?
Eli. I don't know.
Miss P. Don't know?
Eli. No: I shouldn't know him if I was to see him. Listen: I was yet a mere child, when family interest, and the will of my aunt, compelled me to sign a contract of marriage with my only cousin. So determined were my father and aunt on this union of their nearest of kin and estates within a ring fence, that the entire property [50]   we have to live on (with the exception of a small annuity each) goes to distant relatives if this contract is not made good, and the ceremony performed before I am eighteen.
Miss P. My goodness! I wish my parents had had it in their power to have left me so provided for.
Eli. From that hour to this, the thought of it never entered, my mind, till this letter arrived to disturb my repose. [Giving the letter.] Read, Primly, read.
Miss P. It is lucky somebody jogged your memory, or you might have lost your estate, without thinking of it, for you will soon be eighteen.
Eli. I want some months of it yet; besides he, in consideration of my sex, is compelled, by the will, to seek the fulfilment of the contract.
Miss P. My goodness! what odd doings! [Reads.] “ London, December 6th—Dear Eliza, Charles Stapleton has arrived here .” My goodness! Mr. Stapleton, whom I remember when he was a boy, no higher than my waist: he was a charming little fellow then, and what must he be now? Why, you were inseparable.
Eli. True; but the friendship of childhood seldom
[Page 11]
warms with years into a tenderer passion. Read on, Primly.
Miss P. Let me see. [Reads.] “ You can easily imagine [75]   that ten years' travel has a little changed him in appearance, particularly —” Why, yes,—a strange alteration takes place from eleven to twenty-one. “ But every one allows him to possess wit, grace, and amiability .” And what every body says must be true. “ I have no doubt , this contract of marriage, which his parents forced him to sign, and the stipulations attending it, occupy his thoughts entirely.”
Eli. A pretty alternative I have, truly—either to lose my estate, or use every effort to win the affections of a man of whose head or heart I know absolutely nothing. And when I reflect, that he will arrive this very day—
Miss P. I didn't see anything about that in the letter.
Eli. Because you prefer talking to reading, Primly. [Takes the letter, and reads.] “ He has been making numerous inquiries about his affianced wife; but your abode being so retired, hardly any one can furnish him with the least intelligence.—One of his most intimate friends informs me that he leaves town to-morrow for your residence, and will be with you, at the latest, on the 8th instant.”
Miss P. Why, that is to-day, sure enough; and I am attired so inelegantly.
Eli. [Reading.] “He will arrive on foot, disguised as a traveller who demands hospitality, in consequence of having mistaken his road—then decide from actual observation, [100]   either to make himself known, or at once break off a match which may prove equally disagreeable to both parties.” Well, Primly, what say you to this?
Miss P. Why, I say, this affianced husband ought to prove he can render himself agreeable, if he expects to find you so. You have lived happily hitherto, and are not to lose all your little comforts without reason. I would make him marry me, if I was you, whether he liked it or no; and, if he didn't behave well, I'd sue for my conjugal rights.
                                         [Crosses to R. Eli. My resolution is taken: I will not foolishly throw away a handsome fortune, nor shall any sentiment but love on his part unite us. But tell me, Primly—you understand these things—how shall I demean myself, so as not to disgust him at first sight? For, having never quitted this solitude, I am totally ignorant of those elegant accomplishments which constitute the charms of
[Page 12]
your dames of quality. I am certain he will find me silly and insipid—I perceive it myself.
Miss P. Nonsense, nonsense, child—trust to the unsophisticated inspirations of nature—it does wonders in these matters: carry me in your eye.
Eli. Well, then—at first, do not let him know who I am; say that the intended Mrs. S. is absent, and designate me as one of her friends.
Miss P. [125]   Hold, miss, there—these by-ways generally lead to a bad ending—always walk in the broad and high road of truth, if you wish a man to respect you. Say to him, when he arrives, you are Mrs. S.—I am the intended Mrs. S., which my servants and Miss Primly can prove—and the thing is settled. Take my advice. I missed being a mistress three times from over scrupulosity; and if a fourth should ever present himself, rely upon't, I'll take him at his word.
Eli. No matter—now attend: I require—
Enter James , C. D. F. Eli. James, is he—I mean—
Miss P. [Crossing to C., and covering Eliza's embarassment.] What is the message you have to deliver?
James. (L.) Madam, there is a man at the door, who he is a traveller, and has lost his way.
Miss P. [To Eliza.] It must be he.
Eli. [To James.] Well—
James. He requests the favour of shelter for a short time, and to be allowed to dry and warm himself by the kitchen fire, as it both snows and freezes.
Eli. Show him in here, and treat him with the greatest respect and attention.
James. Yes, madam.
Miss P. The greatest attention and respect, mind—
James. Yes, miss. [Aside.] What's in the wind now I wonder?
Eli. [150]   Tell him, I hope he will make himself quite at home, and that I shall wait on him in a few minutes.
                                         [Exit James, C. D. F. Miss P. [Calling.] Make haste, James. [To Eliza.] When a husband comes to offer himself, and in December, it would not be decent to let him cool his heels too long in the hall. Ah, miss, your's is an enviable situation!
                                         [Exit, C. D. F. Eli. Oh, dear! I am getting very nervous; but hope
[Page 13]
glimmers through my cloudy fears, and seems to promise days of happiness.
SONG.— Eliza . 2
Oh! what a joyous day,
   Beaming with pleasure—
Light bounds my heart, so gay;
   Joy without measure—
Rapture now fills my breast.
   Sorrow subsiding,
Now my poor heart's at rest,
   All care deriding.
Strike, then, the castanets;
   Trip it in measure,
Chasing all vain regrets
   With sounds of pleasure.
                                         Fal, lal, la, &c.
Oh! what a joyous day,—
   Love's light is gleaming;
And o'er yon pathless way
[175]      Brightly is beaming;
Sons of the tow'ring mount,
   Vale's fairest daughters,
Taste of love's crystal fount—
   Sweet are its waters.
      Strike, then, &c. Fal, lal, la, &c. Enter James , C. D. F., showing in Stubble , who is wrapped up in a military cloak, having on a military cup, wearing mustachios, and holding under his arm a carpet bag —the snow remaining on his cap and cloak. James. This way, sir.
Stu. You are very good, 'pon my life—you are too good—you are, indeed. I can manage very well below. Bless you, I've no objection to the kitchen—especially as it is near the pantry.
James. Shall I take your cloak and cap, sir?
Stu. Thank you—you are very good. [James takes them.] What a splendid house, both outside and in—I may say it is magnificent,—upon my life, I may.
James. My mistress, sir, desires you will make yourself quite at home, and she will wait on you in a few minutes. Will you take some refreshment?
                                         [Presenting a chair.
[Page 14]
Stu. You are very good. [Aside.] How civil and polite the people are in this house! I never met with such attention in the whole course of my perigrinations. [To James.] I'll take advantage of your kind offer.
                                         [Seating himself. James. Red or white, sir.
Stu. [Not understanding him.] Red or white? I beg pardon—but you said red or white.
James. [200]   Wine, sir.
Stu. Oh! as I am not particular, I'll taste a little of both.
James. Then, sir, you shall have a cold fowl, and the best wine our cellar can produce, in as quick time as it is possible to place it on a tray and ascend the stairs with it.
                                         [Exit, C. D. F. Stu. You are very good. What an extraordinary reception! They take me for a military man—they always do in the country. This cloak and cap, and these sham captivators, give one such an air—I call them [Alluding to his mustachios.] love's air-guns—I always mount them when on my rambles; I find they have ten times the effect of the eye artillery, though I am pretty good at that. Then I always contrive to be as near the high-water mark of fashion's stream as my means will allow. Had these shepherd's plaid trousers made out of my bedroom cotton curtains. [Laughing.] Ha! ha! rather short— attic-window length. [Laughing.] Ha! ha! This waistcoat and boa are the fag ends of Mrs. S.'s shawl and tippet. [Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! Some persons might think I was put to my extremities by travelling on foot: but no—when I have done collecting orders for our straw manufactory at Chippenham, I always prefer returning home that way—one has time to admire the [225]   beauties of the road. One of them smiled at me when I passed her this morning, which induced me to follow her; but she led me such a dance, that, curse me, if I didn't lose her and my way, too, as completely as ever the babes in the wood did. Babes in the wood! I must go home—and, when I do, what have I in perspective? a marriage, and the straw business. Oh! I shall arrive soon enough. In the meantime, I'll just put down this bag, which that modern Penelope, Mrs. S. that is to be, made with her own delicate hands. [Puts the carpet-bag on a chair, R.] How we adore each other! When business calls me from her, and “home, sweet home,”
[Page 15]
our souls are so oppressed, they sink into our shoes, and with a sigh I exclaim, at parting, “Sukey, adieu! pleasure, good bye!” And yet, because I have had the misfortune (and it is really a misfortune) to be signalized as a man standing high in Cupid's calendar, I can't leave home for a fortnight without the loving and beloved creature, who is to be the wife of my bosom, sending me a dozen letters, full of love and madness, jealousy, and revenge; though she has my written promise, signed, sealed, and witnessed, with possession of my money, plate, and every moveable of value— with the exception of myself. She can't help it, I know, but is it my fault that I am endowed with an unusual [250]   degree of sensibility, a good person, and a sort of contagious amiability? But this said refreshment has not made its appearance yet. If they should be humbugging, after all!
Enter James and Robert , C. D. F., with a tray, which they place on the table, near the front, C.— John , with another tray, stands L., on which are the pickles, wine, &c. James. Your refreshment, sir
Rob. Chair, sir.
Stu. [Sitting down at the table, C.] 'Pon my life, it is a fowl, and I'm a Turk if it a'nt real wine—well, it's quite astonishing.
James. [Going up to Stubble, R.] Bread, sir.
Rob. [Going up to him, L.] Wine, sir.
Stu. You are very good—won't you pick a bit?
James & Rob. [With surprise.] Sir!
Stu. [Aside.] Oh, I had forgot. [Aloud.] I mean, won't you pick a bit of this when it goes down stairs?
James & Rob. Sir!
Stu. [Aside, helping himself to a bit of fowl.] I had better stop my mouth with this leg, or I shall put my foot in it.
James. (L.) [Handing pickles.] Chilis, sir.
Stu. [Not understanding him.] Yes, rather; but I shall soon be warm now, I thank you.
James. I mean chili pickle, sir.
Stu. Oh, ha! [Aside.] Are those red things nice, I wonder? [Eating chili.] Dam'me! they're red hot!
James. [275]   Warmed your tongue a little, sir?

[Page 16]
Stu. Yes; and you'll feel the effects of it if you play any of your tricks upon me. A glass of wine. [Aside.] I must tip these Cyclops a bit of gentility. [Speaking loud.] I say, give us another glass of wine, and be damn'd to you. [Robert hands wine.] Now, you don't call that a glass of wine, do you?—Why, it isn't above three parts full.
James. I beg pardon, sir—
Stu. [Catching the eye of one and then the other—aside.] I can't eat while they stand watching me. [Aloud.] Hark'ye, your mistress said, I believe, I was to make myself at home.
James & Rob. Yes, sir.
Stu. Then quit the presence. [James and Robert attempt to clear away.] No, no, leave the refreshment, for talking has given me a fresh appetite.
                                         [Exeunt James, Robert, and John, C. D. F.—Stubble sits and eats. Enter Miss Primly , R. S. E., very mysteriously. Miss P. [Speaking almost in a whisper.] Madam is still at her toilette, and I have taken the opportunity it has afforded me, to see him, and inform him of every thing. She charged me to keep it a secret, but it is for the happiness of both I speak.—Sir, [Going up to Stubble.] sir—
Stu. [Half choked and frightened.] Eh! ma'am!
Miss P. (R.) [Making a formal courtesy.] I believe, sir, you are the handsome traveller—
Stu. [Rising.] I am, ma'am.
Miss P. [Aside.] [300]   He is an uncommon well-made man, and those mustachios give him quite the air of a traveller. I should hardly have recognised him for my pretty little Charley, if there hadn't been a family likeness. [Looks round mysteriously, and then beckons him forward.] Hist! hist!
Stu. [Aside.] Who the devil is this, I wonder?
Miss P. She has been expecting you with the greatest impatience.
Stu. Has she, indeed?—But who is she?
Miss P. Why, your affianced wife.
Stu. What, Mrs. S. that is to be?
Miss P. To be sure,—I'm convinced she loves you already

[Page 17]
Stu. Well, I know she does: how long has she been here?
Miss P. Above seven years: ever since her father died.
Stu. [Aside.] Oh, this is some fetch. Why, I left her at Chippenham seven days since. [Aloud.] Do you mean to say that the intended Mrs. S. that is to be, has been living here upwards of seven years.
Miss P. Yes, I'll take my oath on't.
Stu. What, my Sukey?
Miss P. Your Sukey?—Oh, fie, sir, to talk in that indelicate [325]   way. Sukey, indeed! no, your Eliza, whom you know you are bound to marry. You would disguise yourself—you would find out this, that, and t'other —but we have found you out.
Stu. Out! yes, and you very kindly took me in.
Miss P. Into your own house, where a charming girl is ready to obey the will of her parents, and receive you as her husband. You see I know as much as you do, good sir.
Stu. [Aside.] A great deal more, I think. [Aloud.] Then who do you take me for?
Miss P. For one who will shortly be the proprietor of this mansion, and the husband of my sweet mistress.
Stu. [Aside.] Here's unlooked-for luck!—Dame Fortune is smitten with me herself—my planet must be Venus.
Miss P. Don't you remember Primly, sir?—Why, I taught you to run.
Stu. Yes; I have some recollection of it now.
Miss P. I dare say, I'm a little altered since then?
Stu. Yes, a little: I'm a little altered, too, you know.
Miss P. Oh, astonishingly! who would ever believe I had dandled you on my knee.
Stu. [Aside.] I can't believe it myself—it is my fate to receive favours from the fair—what can I do?—I [350]   can't help being engaging—the women will run after me—they would, I verily believe, if I was to go to Van Dieman's Land, or the Swan River. “I am but mortal; and, Fate, do thou dispose of me.” Is my intended handsome?
Miss P. Lovely: fresh as a rose—just what I was at eighteen.
Stu. Ah! I can easily imagine what you were at that age. This is a fine estate?

[Page 18]
Miss P. Oh, a princely domain; and the income derived from it immense.
Stu. [Aside.] Then she must be handsome. 'Pon my life, I shan't dislike being the proprietor of such an estate as this. It's a sort of character one can play without much study—do this, do that, and it's done [Aloud.] My good madam—
Miss P. Call me Primly, sir—plain Primly.
Stu. Well, then, I will call you plain Primly—won't it be rather difficult—awkward, I mean.
Enter James , C. D. F. Stu. Oh, this is my chili friend.
James. (C.) Is my mistress in her chamber?
Miss P. (L. C.) What do you want with her?
James. I came to inform her of an accident that has happened in our cross-road—the pair-horse coach which comes round this way three times a week, has broke down not far from here.
Miss P. [Pointing to Stubble.] [375]   Speak to this gentleman.
James. [Surprised.] Ma am!
Miss P. Is the man deaf?—Take your orders from this gentleman.
Stu. [Aside.] Well, the least I can do is to do as I have been done by. James, stir your stumps! send immediate assistance to these poor travellers. Let the house, the wine, be all at their service. Get out the cold meat and the pickles—spare nothing—I know what it is to be sharp set after sitting outside a coach in a hard frost, with a cutting north-easter blowing in your teeth.
                                         [Exit James, C. D. F. Miss P. [Aside.] The same good heart he possessed when he was breeched.
Stu. In the meantime, my dear Primly, had I not better make myself a little more presentable. I don't think I have quite the air of the master of an establishment like this, as I am.
                                         [Crosses to R., sits down, and opens his carpet-bag, and takes out a shirt, a cravat, and pair of stockings. Miss P. [Calling.] James!
Enter James , C. D. F. Miss P. Show this gentleman to the best apartment.

[Page 19]
James. (C.) To the best apartment!
Miss P. (L.) Why, the man's crazed! To the best apartment—do you understand? the best apartment. Here, John!
Enter John , C. D. F. Miss P. Assist this gentleman off with his boots.
                                         [John crosses to Stubble, and takes hold of his leg. Stu. [Striking him on the shoulder.] [400]   Hollo! what are you up to? none of your nonsense.
John. Boots, sir.
Stu. Oh, presently.
Miss P. Don't trouble yourself, sir. [Calling.] Here, James! Robert!
Enter Robert , C. D. F. Miss P. John, carry those things to this gentleman's apartment. [They each take an article.] I went myself to see if they had lit a fire, and put every thing in order— now don't crumple those things.
Stu. [Aside.] 'Pon my life, this is one of the most comfortable old souls I ever met with.
Miss P. This way, sir. John, open the door.
                                         [John opens the door, L. Stu. [Crossing to L., and bowing to the Servants.] You're very good. 'Pon my life, this is very agreeable.
                                         [Exit Stubble, L. D.—They all show him great attention, and exeunt after him.

END OF ACT I.
ACT II. SCENE I. —Another Apartment in the Mansion. Enter Housemaid, James, John , and Robert , R. Hou. (C.) Now, James, do tell us all you know about this strange man and his strange reception.
James. (L. C.) Oh, don't ask me. I know nothing, nor I can't learn. Is Tom gone to bring these tumbledown folks here, as Mr. What's-his-name desired?
Hou. Ay, what's his name, that's what we want to know. Hang me, if I don't think there is some witchcraft in it—here have we been for years, without a soul darkening our doors that could be called a visitor, and
[Page 20]
when this chap comes, who looks no more like a gentleman than I do—he is treated like a prince.
Rob. (L.) Ay, if he were a prince, it would make all the difference, whether he were a gentleman or no. For it's customary to treat all princes as come here with such display, that one of the dinners we give them would buy their whole domain.
James. Very true: John pays for all.
John. (R.) No, he don't.
James. [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha! I was not speaking of you, but John Bull.
Hou. Talking o' that, I wonder what missus is about to give such an ordinary chap as that ere encouragement. She must be at her last prayers.
James. Stuff and nonsense! Why, I might as well [25]   think of marrying the kitchen-maid.
                                         [Crosses conceitedly to L. Enter Miss Primly , L. Miss P. Hoity toity! here's a commotion; pray, can you find no employment, that you are idling your time away? Thank heaven, you have now a master that will not be imposed upon, like your good-natured mistress.
All the Servants. A master!
James. Master! did you say master, madam?
Miss P. Yes, James; the gentleman you had the honour to attend just now, is the intended husband of your mistress and your future master.
Rob. (R.) Why, he asked me to pick a bit with him.
Miss P. Ay, ay, that was only to preserve his incognito. He came here in disguise, to ascertain what kind of a lady was to be his wife.
Hou. But, I say, ma'am, do great folks never love one another, then, before they be man and wife?
Miss P. Very seldom, child; or after, either. [A bell rings, R.—the Servants do not move.] There's your master ringing. [All the Servants run R. to answer it.] Now where are you all running to?
All. To wait on master, ma'am.
Miss P. One at a time, if you please. James, do you go, and the rest of you hasten to receive the people who have met with the accident on the road.
Rob. [Crossing to L. What a nice man master is.
                                         [Exit, L. James. [50]   And very handsome.
                                         [Exit, R.
[Page 21]
Hou. [Crossing to L. Oh, one could see, with half an eye, he was a gentleman born.
                                         [Exeunt Housemaid and John, L. Miss P. What a charming man this Mr. Stapleton is. He told me just now I was one of the best of women— amiable creature! Well, I'll go and see if he is in want of anything. But this coach turning over will upset us all—I must let Miss Eliza know what a delightful husband she will have; but he'll soon convince her of that himself. My goodness! here is a lady and gentleman coming up the avenue already—some of the passengers, I dare say—they look like man and wife. I declare, what with this marriage and the accident, this will be one of the pleasantest days I have had for a long time. I wonder whether any nice, single, middle-aged man has had his arm broken—I'm an excellent nurse, and that's a desirable quality in a wife.
                                         [Exit, R. SCENE II. —Same as Scene I., Act I. Enter Mr. Stapleton , with green spectacles, and Miss Susan Plat , C. D. F., shown in by the Servants—Stapleton carrying her bonnet-box completely crushed, and covered with snow. Sta. [Entering.] Thank'ye, thank'ye—we shall do very well, now—look to those ladies and the other travellers.
                                         [Exeunt Servants, C. D. F. Miss Plat. (L.) Oh, dear! oh, dear! deuce take them plaguy coaches, say I. I kept calling out to the coachman “you'll be over! you'll be over!” and sure enough over we went—the coachman with his head into my bonnet-box—look here, sir, [Taking out her bonnet.] my beautiful split straw split all to ribbons. They don't care how or where they drive. I wish Muckadam would just come and look at the ruts in this out-of-the-way road, and if he didn't say— [Checking herself.] —swear, he must have more good words at his tongue's end than I should, if I were a man. If the people at this great house had not been civil enough to give us shelter for a little bit, I don't know what we should have done. Pretty figures we should have cut, trudging through the snow and mud to the next village.
Sta. (R. C.) I consider myself extremely fortunate, in being so near at hand to assist you. [Aside.] Nothing could fall out better than the upsetting of this coach for
[Page 22]
me. It having procured me an accidental introduction into this house, when I was at my wit's end how to accomplish it.
Miss Plat. Ah, sir! I am greatly obliged to your [25]   kindness. No man could be more gallant or delicate in his attentions. I hardly knew whether I was on my head or my heels.
Sta. I am happy in being enabled to satisfy you on that point.
Miss Plat. But people do fall very awkwardly under such circumstances. There's a fine impression of my figure in the snow. [Aside.] Oh, I'll make that Stubble shed many a briny tear, for bringing his Susan into this pickle!
Sta. I hope you are not hurt, madam.
Miss Plat. Not that I know of, thank ye, sir. My feelings are more hurt than my person: you will hardly believe it, sir, but I am in pursuit of a husband.
Sta. [Drawing off a little.] Are you indeed, madam?
Miss Platt. Yes, sir. Mr. S.'s journey this time was to get in wholly orders.
Sta. Oh! at one of the universities?
Miss Plat. La! no, sir—at Andover and Devizes. He ought to have been home eight days ago.
Sta. [Approaching her again.] Then you are married?
Miss Plat. Not quite, sir: last Sunday week was the third time of asking. Susan Plat, spinster, to Narcissus Stubble, widower. The ceremony was to have taken place immediately, to prevent accidents, and the knot is [50]   not tied yet. You hav'nt the pleasure of knowing me, I believe, sir—I am in the straw line—the first in Chippenham —quite famous, sir, for my shapes, from Leghorn to Dunstable. So well am I known, sir, that if one of my customers puts her head out of doors of a Sunday, you're sure to hear every body say, “That's one of Miss P.'s pokes!” or, “That's one of Miss P.'s cottages, walking with Mr. Mite, the cheesemonger;” or, “There goes one of Miss P.'s gipsies into the fortune-teller's.” Mr. S. occupies my first-floor, and when at home dyes for me once a week, and does all my blocking. A shocking thing, isn't it, to be obliged to leave home, with such a business as mine. Why, you'll hardly believe, sir, I have a dozen hands at work at this moment, stitching and stealing straw; and, instead of looking after them, I'm looking after this fickle Mr. S. However,
[Page 23]
I've got his written promise, and possession of all his cash and his moveables, as he calls them, locked up in his room, and the key in my pocket. But what are those, compared with connubial comforts?
Sta. 'Tis a pity he is missing at a time like this.
Miss Plat. [Half crying.] Ah, sir, he is always missing —he is as inconstant as the wind—as vain and fickle as the weather thing at top of the church.
Sta. You think him a little inclined to be gay?
Miss Plat. [75]   I know him to be outrageously gay—as gay as a white chip hat, trimmed with orange and blue ribbons.
Sta. Then I don't wonder at your being doubtful of his constancy.
Miss Plat. If you knew all, sir, you wouldn't wonder at anything. But no, sir: formerly, I confess, being a little doubtful—and I had sufficient cause—he was always flirting with my hands, making them giggle and laugh, instead of stitching, till I was forced to lock 'em up, to keep 'em at arm's length. All I wish now, sir, is to marry him, that I may teaze and vex him, and never let him rest, night or day.
Sta. Your intentions are much to be commended, and show you are not at all vindictive. [Aside.] Thank heaven, this is not my intended—a pretty specimen of promised happiness!
Miss Plat. As I say to Miss Furbelow, the milliner, when she envies me my shapes, “What's the good of being jealous? tormenting yourself, and every body about you.” No, no—no more jealousy for me! That's all over now—I know what it is too well. [Perceiving Stubble's bag on chair, R.] Eh! what do I see? can I believe my eyes?
Sta. What is the matter, madam?
Miss Plat. [100]   Nothing, sir. Only that thingamery bag is so like Mr. Stubble's, that [Aside.] I could almost swear —I think I know the shape of it too well to be deceived.
                                         [Stapleton retires up, R. Stu. [Without, L. S. E.] My good Primly, will you be kind enough to desire them to clean my boots?
Miss Plat. What do I hear?
                                         [Going towards the door of Stubble's room, L. Enter Miss Primly , R. D. Miss P. [Crossing to Miss Plat, and holding her, to
[Page 24]
prevent her going into Stubble's room.] My goodness! where are you going?
Miss Plat. [Embarrassed.] No where. I know the person who is in that apartment very intimately, and I would—
Miss P. Oh! you do, do you? you know Mr. S.?
Miss Plat. [Aside.] Mr. S.! it is he, sure enough. [Aloud.] And pray, madam, how long have you known Mr. S.?
Miss P. Ever since he was bre—unmentionably clad. He is at present here incog., to see how he likes my mistress, before he brings matters to bear. So, not a word—mum—he has not yet declared himself.
Miss Plat. Oh, he has not yet declared himself! [Aside.] I am arrived very opportunely.
Sta. [Who has been looking towards the door Miss Primly entered at.] I don't see anything of her—or at least any one who resembles my fancied portrait of her. [To Miss Primly.] May I be permitted to speak to Miss Gordon?
Miss P. [Aside.] [125]   So, he wants to speak to Miss Gordon. These poor children will never have a moment to themselves. [To Stapleton.] Miss Gordon is paying some visits in the neighbourhood, and will not be at home to-day. [To Miss Plat.] My master, Mr. S., is particularly engaged.
                                         [Goes up, R. C. Miss Plat. [Aside.] Her master! I shall choke with rage! But I'll—I declare, my mouth's as clammy as if I had swallowed a pot of starch—I must get a glass of water, and gulp down my feelings; I'll keep myself cool, then see how far he will push his perfidy—and make him turn as white as if he had been bleached by my presence. I'll have an action for breach of promise —I'll rouse all the courts in England against him— I'll court him!—At any rate, I'll have damages—I feel as if I had assault and battery at my fingers' ends! Oh, that I might trim him as I would a bonnet! I'd stick him full of pins, and throttle him with the ribbon.
                                         [Exit. C. D. F. Sta. [Aside.] With these glasses on, I think I may defy the most curious to know me. [To Miss Primly.] So, then, Miss Gordon is from home?
Miss P. I have already told you so, sir.
Sta. Then pray be kind enough to tell me who that pretty young lady is.
                                         [Pointing off, R.
[Page 25]
Miss P. Oh, that's a friend of my mistress's. [Aside] [150]   My goodness! what a very odd couple.
Enter Eliza Gordon , R. Eli. Oh, Primly, I have been looking for you. [Perceiving Stapleton.] Mercy on me! this must be he.
                                         [They salute each other very ceremoniously. Sta. I am informed, madam, that Miss Gordon is at present from home.
Eli. [Aside.] So, so, Primly has observed my orders. [To Stapleton.] I am exceedingly sorry, sir—
Sta. Her absence is of no consequence—I did wish to have seen and spoken to her; but now— [Aside.] had this beautiful creature been my intended, I should have been the happiest dog alive.
Eli. Miss Gordon will return to-morrow.
Miss P. Yes, to-morrow—
Eli. In her absence, she has requested me to perform the honours of the house, and I hope, sir, you will do us the pleasure of remaining here till her return.
Miss P. [Aside.] What!
Sta. Madam, I— [Aside.] that look has won my heart, and lost my estate. Just such a lovely being was I in hopes to find Miss Gordon. [Aloud.] From what I have seen and heard, I prefer writing. Rest assured, madam, it is with sincere regret I am obliged to decline your invitation. [Aside.] What an adverse fate is mine! I already feel this to be the only woman I could ever love, and yet interest and honour, as regards the lady's [175]   loss of fortune, compel me to oppose the dictates of my heart, and fly from all that would render life endurable in the married state. [To Eliza.] Madam, I most respectfully take my leave.
                                         [Exit, C. D. F. Eli. Oh, Primly, I am enchanted!
Miss P. With what?
Eli. With him.
Miss P. With him? my goodness! with that gentleman who said nothing to enchant any body, that I heard, unless there be witchery in his spectacles.
Eli. Oh, they were merely assumed as a disguise. What an elegant manner he has—do not suffer him to leave the house, for I begin to feel very angry with myself for not declaring who I was at once.
Miss P. Why, who do you take him to be?
Eli. Stapleton.

[Page 26]
Miss P. What, your intended husband?
Eli. Certainly.
Miss P. My goodness! Mr. S. is a very different person to this—I have seen him, spoken to him. Ah! when you see him, you will be enchanted.
Eli. Then, this person—
Miss P. Was travelling with his wife by the coach that broke down, just now.
Eli. His wife!
Miss P. [200]   Yes; a very smart body, I assure you. They came here arm-in-arm.
Eli. What have I done?
Miss P. But Mr. S. [Looking off, L.] As I live, here he comes! Look at him, madam—what a fine figure, upright as the Monument, and a pair of mustachios that would add dignity to a duke.
                                         [They retire up, R. Enter Stubble , dressed very smart, L. Stu. 'Pon my life! I begin to feel like a landholder, instead of a land-trudger.—This is a deuced sight better than Suckey and the straw business—it's very odd, though —Lord! if there should be such a thing as an enchanted castle,—I have read of such things. [Seeing Miss Primly.] Ah, Primly! how do you do, Primly? Something like, now, eh? They can't say a tailor made me. [Seeing Eliza, R.] I say, is that the lady who is anxious to be bone of my bone? 'Pon my life, she is a lovely creature.
Miss P. [Advancing towards him.] Isn't she! she's horribly nervous about seeing you, though.
Stu. Yes, I know: I feel a little odd, myself; but that will soon wear off, when we get used to one another.—Hem! what a handsome couple we shall make. [To Eliza.] Hem!
                                         [Crossing to C., rather confused. Miss P. [Apart to Stubble.] Don't speak too plainly, at first.
Stu. [225]   No; I know, bless you,—I'll give her a touch of the high-flown parliamentary style, where all sense is enveloped in mystery, like London in a November pea-soup-coloured fog. Hem!— [Eliza advances, R.] — hem!— [In great confusion.] —hem!— [To Primly, L.] — It's coming—I've got it here. [Touching his forehead.] Hem!—I—how do you do?—hope you are well?—I am very well, thankee.—Fine day—hem!—It's very extraordinary
[Page 27]
—I say it's very extraordinary, how some individuals of our species, who have never clapp'd their oculars on each other, are imperceptibly attracted towards other individuals of our species by a species of loadstonativeness. [Turning to Primly.] What do you think of that, eh?
Miss P. That's not speaking too plainly, certainly.
Eli. I do not doubt, sir, that your arrival will add much to the happiness of us all; but I am at this moment so greatly agitated—
Stu. Which is very flattering to me; and when we know each other better—
Eli. Yes, sir; I will endeavour to remove the unfavourable impressions this reception must give birth to.
Stu. Bless you! you shall never give birth to any unfavourable impressions, I promise you. [Apart, to Primly.] The sight of me is too much for her.
Eli. [250]   You are not obliged to proceed on your journey, I presume.
Stu. No, bless your little heart, I have plenty of time before me; only, the sooner it's over the better. [Eliza and Primly retire up, R., and converse.] Bravo! I am regularly installed here, and I like it amazingly— 'pon my life, I do.—I can't help heaving a sigh for Sukey, though.—What a victim I am to the tender passion.
                                         [Retires up, R., and joins Primly and Eliza. Enter Stapleton , unperceived, C. D. F. Sta. (L. C.) No; I will not go: it is absolutely necessary I should have an interview with her, and— [Seeing Stubble.] —what man is this?
Stu. [To Eliza.] A dinner teté a teté—the honour is too great.
                                         [Kisses her hand. Sta. [Advancing.] I beg ten thousand pardons, madam; my presence is doubtless intrusive, and I will retire.
Eli. No, sir, there is not the least occasion.
Sta. I perceive that this retreat is not quite so inaccessible to male society, as I was led to expect; I really had some fears, when I was about leaving, the house, that dangers might encompass this solitude, but I shall now quit it, well assured of your safety, seeing in whose company I leave you.
Stu. [Aside.] Who is this ironical gentleman, I wonder.

[Page 28]
Eli. [275]   I am ignorant, sir, of what you are complaining.
Sta. I, madam! I complain!—who shall have given me such a right?—I merely meant to observe, madam, that there are sentiments we may regret having formed, and illusions by which we are sadly deceived.
Miss P. [To Eliza] Well, this is very pretty, for a married man. Why does he not attend to his wife, poor neglected thing.
Eli. [To Stapleton.] I now see the consequences of what I considered an innocent pleasantry. I told you that Miss Gordon was from home, and that I was one of her friends; I deceived you, and whatever opinion you may please to form of this little falsehood, I feel it necessary to avow the truth,—I am Miss Gordon herself.
Sta. [With great vehemence.] How?—Is it possible? —Can I believe my ears?—You are—
Stu. [Stepping in, and drawing himself up with mock dignity.] Yes, sir; I am—no, she is Miss Gordon.
Eli. Any further communication must be through this gentleman. [Pointing to Stubble.] I beg, therefore, you will put aside your incognito; inform him who you are, and the ties by which we are bound to each other.—Come, Primly.
                                         [Exeunt Eliza and Primly, R. S. E. Sta. [Aside.] What the devil does all this mean?—I had better preserve my incognito, till I ascertain the real state of things.—I suppose she has united herself [300]   to this man, and wished, on account of the property, to have preserved the secret as long as possible.
Stu. [Aside.] I must get rid of this chap.—I'll affront him.
Sta. Well, sir, I— [Going up close to Stubble, R. C.
Stu. Hollo! don't speak to me with goggles on, as if you would penetrate the bottom of my heart and see all its little palpitations.
Sta. Sir, I—
Stu. I won't hear a word, till those windows are removed, you're staring through. [Aside.] I declare they put me out of countenance; if a lady was to serve me so, I should blush.
Sta. [Aside.] I have a great mind to—but no—my ends will be best attained by coolness. [Aloud.] Well, sir, since you insist—
                                         [Takes off his spectacles. Stu. [Boldly.] To be sure, I do. [Aside.] I have frightened him; all owing to these mustachios,—they
[Page 29]
make me look so fierce. [Aloud.] Ay, now you are something like.—Bless you, it is impossible to improve nature—ecce signum.
                                         [Turning round. Sta. And now, sir, you will inform me what relation exists between you and Miss Gordon?
Stu. The relation is very natural and very simple.— I am her husband—that is to be.
Sta. [325]   Her husband that is to be?
Stu. That is to be.
Sta. I am rejoiced to hear it. [Shaking Stubble's hand violently.] Damm'e it is not quite so bad as I expected.
Stu. [Aside.] Curse the fellow! he has nearly shook my arm off—I'll return the compliment. [Taking Stapleton's hand, and squeezing it very hard.] I shall always be glad to see you, and beg you will consider yourself as one of the family; my heart is in my hand, sir.
Sta. [Aside.] What a hard-hearted villain he must be, then. [To Stubble.] Do you know, sir, that I am particularly acquainted with the gentleman Miss Gordon is bound to marry.
Stu. Very likely: but she has changed her mind, you see.—I was bound to another, by promise—a piecrust promise. I am not such a fool as to let love stand between me and a wife with rents sufficient to buy up the French rentes,—curse me but I'd have her, if she had but one eye, one arm, and one leg of a sort.
Sta. [Aside.] Oh, oh! [Aloud.] Of course you are aware Miss Gordon forfeits the whole of her property, the moment you become her husband.
Stu. No, I can't say I am aware of any such thing.
Sta. Is it possible you are ignorant—
Stu. Ignorant!—what do you mean by ignorant?— [350]   No, sir—but what if I choose to be ignorant, if I have my reasons for it. There are family secrets, that are not for strangers to penetrate: you don't know what marriage is, sir, or you would not jest upon so serious a matter as the union of two fond hearts in one. Begone, and quit the building.
                                         [Turns up, R. Sta. I merely mentioned a well-known fact, and—
Enter Miss Primly , R. S. E. Sta. I dare say this confidential-looking lady can confirm my statement.—Madam, will you be so kind as to answer me one question?
                                         [Crosses to C.
[Page 30]
Stu. Ay, and answer him truly, as you hope to be married.
Miss P. [To Stapleton.] Well, sir?
Sta. What will Miss Gordon lose by not marrying Mr. Stapleton?
Miss P. The whole of her property, to be sure—every stick and stone.
Stu. And this is the truth—
Miss P. Law! you know it is—but I must commence arrangements for your marriage.
                                         [Exit, C. D. F. Stu. For my hanging, you mean: a pretty noose I was going to poke my head into. This house is a d---d large man-trap, in which I had like to have been caught.
Sta. I hope you are now satisfied?
Stu. Oh, yes, I'm satisfied, with a vengeance; and [375]   had I nearly forsook my Sukey and the straw business— my money and moveables, for this?—In what a gulf of ingratitude was I about to plunge—horrible, horrible!
                                         [Falls into a chair, R. Enter Miss Plat , C. D. F. Miss Plat. [To Stapleton.] Oh, sir, I have come to solicit your kind offices, under most heart-rending circumstances.
Stu. [Standing amazed at seeing Miss Plat.] By gosh! my intended wife!
Sta. His intended wife! [Taking Miss Plat's hand, and checking her from speaking.] So, so, sir, you would be the husband of every pretty woman you see?
Stu. That's nothing to the point, sir; I wish to know what business that lady has here, when she ought to be at home?
Miss Plat. (L. C.) [Aside.] It is he, sure enough, and whiskered like a cat.
Sta. (C.) She is here with me.
                                         [Taking her arm in his. Stu. (R. C.) With you, sir? you will please to inform me what species of intimacy exists between you and that lady?
Sta. Death and the devil, sir! she's my wife.
Stu. Your wife?
Sta. That is to be. [Aside.] I'll be even with him. [To Miss Plat.] Second me in what I have said.
Miss Plat. [Apart to Stapleton.] I will, never fear— I'll have my revenge on him.
Stu. [400]   And you, madam, you will not dare to be in the same story.

[Page 31]
Miss Plat. [Taking Stapleton's arm, and looking at Stubble through her eye-glass, with pretended astonishment.] My dear friend, who is this odd-looking man?
Stu. Her dear friend! before my face, too! I'll have an action for breach of promise.
Miss Plat. Really, my good man, I know nothing of you. [Affectedly.] and cannot imagine the cause of your trouble and agitation. [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha!
Sta. [Aside.] Bravo! don't spare him.
                                         [To Miss Plat. Miss Plat. [To Stapleton.] My dear, only look at him —don't you think we ought to call for a strait waistcoat, and have his head shaved. If he goes mad, the queer wretch may bite. [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha!
Stu. Queer wretch! bite! I'm bit, I think—this coolness confounds me. My dear soul, permit me to refresh your memory—I am Narcissus Stubble, straw manufacturer, at Chippenham, in the country of Wiltshire— 'pon my life, I am.
Miss Plat. You! ridiculous! and have you the assurance to pass yourself off for another man?—Base counterfeit! you, you my much-loved Narcissus—you Mr. Stubble! to your utter confusion, behold him in this gentleman, to whom, with this key, I give up the whole of the property he intrusted to my care, and who, in a few hours, will call his devoted Susan his for life.
                                         [Embracing Stapleton. Stu. [425]   What! will you attempt to persuade me I am not myself?
Sta. You cannot be yourself, sir, or you would not attempt to palm so gross and palpable an imposition upon an unsuspecting female.
Stu. Pho! humbug!
Miss Plat. How you have obtained the knowledge of my dear Stubble's name, I know not—suffice it, I am not blind to his person or his virtues.
Stu. Then look at me, my dear.
Miss Plat. You, you vampire?
Sta. [Tenderly singing to Miss Plat.]
“Meet me by moonlight alone.” Stu. Am I asleep or awake?—When I come here, I find myself the intended of a person who is not my intended, and when my real intended comes, I find she's not my intended, and that her intended is not me. [Stapleton and Miss Plat laugh.] Come, don't put your risible muscles in motion at me—I am a lamb about to
[Page 32]
be sacrificed, but it shall not be on the altar of mirth. [Stapleton and Miss Plat seat themselves on one chair very lovingly.] Let go her hand, I command you
Sta. The man's mad! therefore, my dear Susan—
                                         [Kissing her hand, rising, and coming forward. Stu. (R.) Oh, for a constable! my property for a constable! [Kneels to Miss Plat, who is in C.] Sukey, I sue for mercy!
Sta. (L.) [450]   [Kneeling on the other side.] Don't listen to him, Susan.
Stu. Oh, you Bonassus!
Enter Miss Primly , C. D. Miss P. (L. C.) What do I see! Mr. Stapleton at the feet of another!
Sta. (L.) [Jumping up.] I am known!
                                         [Aside. Miss P. (R. C.) [Taking Stubble's hand.] Pray, rise, Mr. S. If my mistress should come—
Stu. Blow your mistress!
Miss Plat. Let me go, sir.
Stu. Sukey dear, Sukey, my love, I beg, I implore.
Sta. [To Miss Plat.] Don't forgive him yet.
                                         [Laughing. Miss P. I suppose you are not aware that this gentleman, who stands there looking at you, is this lady's husband?
Stu. Her fiddlestick! Primly [Turning to her, which gives Stapleton an opportunity of taking Miss Plat's place by the side of Stubble.] —my dear Primly, it's all a hoax —all fudge; she's mine, by right. [Taking Stapleton's hand, supposing it to be Miss Plat's.] Now, my dear Sukey— [Discovering his error, rises in a passion.] This is too much! I won't stand this any longer.
Sta. Nor I either, sir; and, if you presume to speak to this lady again—you understand—
Stu. Pistols, I suppose—very well, sir—I am ready to follow you.
                                         [Stapleton goes up to C. D. F. Miss P. [475]   Oh! I'll alarm my lady, or she'll lose her husband.
                                         [Exit, R. S. E. Miss Plat. I hope he'll shoot him.
Stu. [Going, and looking at Miss Plat, expecting her to prevent him.] She does not stop me—you see, Sukey, I'm going—going to be made sausage-meat of. Nothing affects her—then come along.
                                         [Exeunt Stapleton and Stubble, C. D. F. Stu. [Returning immediately.] Did you call, my dear!

[Page 33]
Miss Plat. No!
Stu. Oh! [Goes out, and returns again.] She takes it as coolly as if I was going to a ball instead of a bullet.
Miss Plat. You are the master of your own actions.
Stu. Ah! you would not say such a cutting thing, if we were married.
Sta. [Returning, C. D. F.] Come, sir.
Stu. I'll be shot if I fight for such a woman as that.
Sta. [Coming down, R.] Then I shall horsewhip you.
Stu. (C.) You'll do what, sir?
Sta Horsewhip you, unless you fight me or pull off those mustachios.
Stu. [Going up to Stapleton.] Do you mean that in joke or earnest?
Sta. In earnest! [Very fiercely] Choose your alternative!
Stu. [To Miss Plat.] Oh, frailty! thy name is Sukey Plat.
Sta. Come, sir, you have insulted my intended, assumed [500]   my name—and, by heaven! you shall do one or the other, or take the consequences.
                                         [Shaking his whip. Stu. You see what I am suffering on your account! [Pulls off one of his mustachios.] Your perfidy, ma'am, shall be cried about the streets, three yards a halfpenny.
Sta. The other, sir.
Stu. The other what? Oh! you see what a martyr I am to my affections. [Pulling off the other mustachio.] There!
Sta. You made me take off my spectacles, you know —so it's merely tit for tat.
Stu. Of course, that was my only motive for complying. Fear was out of the question.
Sta. Oh, that was very evident; besides, the lady may be better able to recognize you now.
Stu. So she may: will you recognise me, Sukey?
Miss Plat. Me! never. [Flouncing by him.] So, I'll go and prepare for our departure, my dear.
Sta. Do, my sweet.
Miss Plat. As for this man of straw, whose head is only fit to block bonnets on—this intruder among the human species—
Stu. [Going up to her.] Well, my dear—
Miss Plat. Oh, you insinuating wretch!
                                         [Exit, C. D. F. Stu. She's dead to all my little fascinations.
                                         [Horn sounds without, L. U. E.
[Page 34]
Enter Robert , C. D. Rob. [525]   The coach is repaired—and that's the guard's horn, calling the passengers together.
Stu. Oh, this damnable house! not a moment to be lost. Now for one desperate last effort to make her know me—for, if she persists—
                                         [Horn sounds again. Rob. [To Stapleton.] They'll start without you.
Sta. [Going.] Not for the world!
Stu. [Stopping him.] Oh, you—stop the coach! stop my wife that is to be.
                                         [Rushes out, C. D. F., followed by Robert. Sta. Ha, ha, ha! excellent! I have given him a Roland for his Oliver, that he will not easily forget.
Enter Eliza Gordon and Miss Primly , R. S. E. Miss P. This way, miss—I shouldn't wonder if they're fighting now.
Eli. Where is Mr. Stapleton
Sta. Here, madam.
Eli. [Evidently agitated.] What mean you, sir?
Sta. That you have been imposed upon; and that I am the true Charles Stapleton, as this letter will testify.
                                         [Handing her a letter. Miss P. Then I have not been paying my court to the rising sun, after all: that's owing to his being behind a cloud.
Eli. [Having hastily read the letter.] My joy is too great for utterance. Oh, Stapleton! from what a prospect of misery have you relieved me.
Sta. Pardon me the pain I have caused you, and the [550]   abruptness of the declaration that you have inspired me with a love, ardent as it is sincere.
Eli. What, already!
Sta. Even so; and may I be permitted to hope a return?
Eli. As I can perceive no objection to the vowed affection of our childhood, I think you may.
Sta. Oh, Eliza, you have rendered me the happiest of men.
                                         [Kneeling. Enter Stubble , C. D. Stu. (L.) She's as stubborn as a mule! no making her know me. [Sees Stapleton at the feet of Eliza.] What do I see? This chap at the feet of my other intended! If you please, sir, may I ask what business you have there?

[Page 35]
Sta. [Rising.] All the business in life, sir, when I am about to become her husband.
Stu. I say, my friend, you now would be the husband of every pretty woman you see—eh? And you, ma'am, are rather inconsistent, considering you would be my wife—will he, nill he.
Sta. Sir, you deceived her, by taking upon yourself the name of Stapleton.
Stu. I—never—I deny the imputation—
Eli. How, sir!
Stu. I call upon Primly to verify it—who would have it she had dandled me on her knee, and breeched me, though I never clapped eyes on her till to-day.
Sta. [575]   Well, all is forgiven—the fault was mine, in having proceeded clandestinely. But soon, my dear Eliza, our union will remove all doubt.
Stu. So, between two wives, I am left without any— verifying the old proverb. Well, after all, I don't know what there is to grieve at: take away a wife—what remains? liberty, love, and the lasses. So, I'll set off to London, where new conquests await, and—
                                         [Going. Enter Miss Plat , C. D. Miss Plat. [Taking him rudely by the arm.] But not without me, Mr. Stubble.
Stu. [Embracing Miss Plat.] I'm owned! I'm owned! the lost Stubble is owned!
Miss P. And, as I think you have been sufficiently punished, I forgive you, providing these cross-road accidents lead to the High Ways of Marriage.
Sta. I beg to return the key of your moveables.
Stu. Oh, Mrs. S. that is to be will take care of them. And now I have nothing on earth to desire. Maids, wives, and widows, if you but smile on the peccadillos of your devoted Stubble—a fig for the men! I happen to know what petticoat government is—this not being the first time I have entered the holy state of matrimony; and, to speak in matrimonial phrase, does any one know any just cause or impediment why your hands should not be united, to keep our High ways and By ways passable? [600]   This is the first time of asking!

   This is Bacchus' holiday! Jer.
Ay, marry is it Bacchus' holiday;
And all the Loves and Cupids are invited
To grace our entertainment with their presence.
The fair Georgina, Count de Dorio's daughter,
This night will be espoused, and general joy
Take the command of every honest heart. Enter Babbla , C. F. Bab.
And yet, though General Joy may take command
Of every honest heart, I greatly fear
Our joy will not be general after all. Jer.
And, pr'ythee, wherefore not, Miss Prateapace? Bab.
For this plain reason, sir: because Georgina,
My honoured mistress, is compelled to wed
Against her inclination. I would give
The world, were I but for one single hour
Placed in her situation.
[Page 10]
Jer.
Would you really?
[25]   And, were you so, pray how would you proceed? Bab.
I would assert each woman's honest right
To choose a husband for herself; and fight,
If urged by fate to such extremity,
Aye, like a lion for my privilege! Jer.
Upon my word, indeed! Bab.
Father, I'd say,
You have a right to claim obedience
In all things else; but where my happiness
For life's at stake, I cannot—will not yield
Myself a sacrifice. Jer.
No more of this; such silly prate
Becomes thee not, thou forward, saucy minx!
An' thou repeat thy slander in my presence,
I'll— Bab. [Daring him.]
Well, old Graybeard, pray what would you do?
Not much, I'm sure. Jer. [Hesitating.]
I'd—wish you—better manners. [Aside.]
I would not marry her, an' I were young,
Not for a kingly crown. Talk of a comet,
An inundation, fire, or a plague,—
What are they? Nothing—to a woman's tongue!                                          [To the Peasantry.
Come, neighbours; 'tis our noble lord's command,
That you regale yourselves without reserve.
So follow me into the servants' hall,
[50]   Where I've prepared for you a goodly banquet.
Come, come!                                          [The Chorus is repeated.—Exit Jeromo at the gates, C. F., followed by the Peasantry dancing. Bab.
Provoking!—Still no news from Genoa,
Whither my lady sent a messenger
To learn some tidings of the Count Fernando,
The youth of her affections. Sancho, too,
His valet—my intended,—not one letter
Have I received from him for twelve long months.
The base, perfidious monster! were he here— Enter Sancho at the garden gates, C. F., listening.
For causing me, his mistress, such alarms,
I'd fall into a most tremendous passion,
And— San. [Coming forward.]
The next moment, fall into his arms!                                          [Embraces her.
[Page 11]
Bab.
What, Sancho! is it you? San.
It is, indeed.
But don't begin to scold! Bab.
Not for the world!
Oh! I'm so glad to see you once again!
How have you been since last we met?—Quite well?                                          [Speaking rapidly.
You've not been wounded in the wars, I hope?                                          [Turning him round and round.
What dangers have you 'scaped? what wonders seen?
Where have you travelled?—Have you made your fortune?
Now for the news! But, first, where is your master? San.
If your bewitching tongue should run much faster,
Our swiftest Barbary horse would ne'er o'ertake it.
[75]   In the first place, my master will be here
Anon; but as for me, I grieve to say,
Miss-fortune, like a trollop, follows me
Where'er I go;—and, though I'd gladly wed,
And make Dame Fortune of her, she refuses
To smile upon me. Still both safe and sound
I now return; except, indeed, the wound
Those lovely eyes inflicted on this heart,
When last we met, and only met to part. Bab.
'Tis well your master's come; but one day later
Had cost him his fair mistress; and I doubt
If even now he be arrived in time;
For long ere this the marriage deed is signed. San.
This news will drive my honoured master mad.
Who, then, is to espouse the fair Georgina? Bab.
The brave and gallant Marquis Sapparino. San.
The greatest coward in all Italy! Bab.
Be cautious what you say! San.
Marry, for what?
If such a poltroon dare to step between
My master and his love, we'll make him scamper! Bab.
No violence, or you'll offend Count Dorio,
My lady's father. So, come in with me,
And let us plot together in the cause
Of darling little Cupid. San.
[100]   So we will. Bab.
Come, Sancho; you and I will do our best.
They merit hate, who lovers never pitied;
And when a woman sets her wits to work— San.
The devil himself is sure to be outwitted.                                          [Exeunt, R.
[Page 12]
Enter Count Fernando at the gates, C. F. Fer.
Hail! dear, beloved spot! the blissful scene
Of all my youthful joys! In yonder bower,
How often have I sat with dear Georgina,
Reading her lovely eyes, and listening
To the love warblings of the nightingale!
Alas! that such sweet music should be marred
By the harsh clang of rude, discordant war!
And yet 'twas for Georgina, lovely maid!
I sought at honour's call the field of strife.
A bold invader trampled on the rights
Of my dear country, and each gallant youth
Marched forth to punish his temerity. RECITATIVO and ARIA.— Count Fernando. RECITATIVO.
   Hail, sacred Freedom! 'tis alone to thee
   I tune the lay. Oh! thou inspire me;
   Whether it be beneath the torrid sun,
   Where the poor negro's toil is never done;
   Or in the gorgeous palace of the great,
   Where titled despots sit in guilty state:
   From his proud throne I'd see each tyrant hurl'd,
   And give thee, godlike Freedom, to the world! ARIA.
[125]         If, in his gigantic race,
      The sun requir'd a resting place,
      He would choose, and love the best,
      The spot that is by Freedom bless'd.
      Into an inglorious grave
      Sink the low-born, coward slave,
      Who can cringe and bend the knee,
      Yet fears to strike for Liberty!
      And, though tyrants may deride,
      Still it is my greatest pride
      To have fought and bled for thee,
      Heaven-born, godlike Liberty!
      Aye, for thee, sweet Liberty!
      Heaven-born, godlike Liberty!
Now, then, to seek the idol of my soul,
My dear, adored Georgina! [Going.] Re-enter Babbla and Sancho at the gates, C. F. Bab. [Stopping the Count.]
Not so fast! Fer.
Ah, Babbla! where's thy mistress? Bab.
At her toilette. Fer.
I recollect: this is her natal day. San.
And more than that, signor—
[Page 13]
Fer. [Alarmed.]
More!—Explain. Bab.
That's quickly done. If lovers stay away
A twelvemonth from their mistresses, nor send
E'en one poor letter to apologise
[150]   For their long absence, it were no great wonder
If woman's patience should be quite worn out. Fer.
I could not write, being a prisoner.
But, speak—what is the drift of this discourse? San.
In brief, my lord, 'tis neither more nor less
Than this. The fair Georgina, thinking you
No longer living, and having no desire
To die an ancient virgin, hath resolved
To wed that brave and most magnanimous hero,
The Marquis Sapparino. Fer. [Impatiently.]
'Sdeath! no more
Of this foul slander of Georgina's truth!
It cannot be! Bab.
It is most true, my lord:
Georgina weds, yet not with her consent. Fer.
Then will I rescue her, assert my claim,
And boldly, in the face of heaven and earth,
Chastise the empty-headed fool, who dared
To step between my lady's love and me!
Sancho! San.
My lord. Fer.
Get ready my Toledo. San. [Drawing a sword.]
'Tis ready, good my lord: your trusty blade
Is bright as woman's eye—sharp as her tongue,
When she maintains wrong's right and right is wrong;
[175]   And hard as is her heart, when some poor swain,
Low at her feet, implores for love in vain. Fer. [Taking the sword.]
Silence thy idle prate, and follow me! San.
I fly, my lord! Bab. [Impeding them.]
Not from this spot one inch.
Duels, indeed! Not force, but stratagem
Can here avail; therefore be ruled by me. Fer.
What! and resign my claim to dear Georgina?
Never! San. [To Babbla.]
Be ruled by you, and tamely yield
To petticoat dominion? Never! never! Bab. [Going.]
Then help yourselves the best you can. Adieu!
[Page 14]
San.
Nay, be not angry; 'twas but a jest, love;—
Return, and we'll submit, [Aside.] since we can't help it. Bab.
Poor creatures! what pretty sorry figures
You would cut, left to your own resources!
But since you're penitent, rely on me;
I will assist you. [Festive music heard without.] Hark! hark! the nuptial
Pageant comes.—Retire!—In yonder alcove
You may unobserved mark all that passes.                                          [Exeunt Fernando, Sancho, and Babbla, hastily, into the alcove, L. U. E. Music .—Enter Female Peasants, dancing and strewing flowers— Georgina , in a canopy borne by Peasants, followed by Count de Dorio, Jeromo , and Domestics, at the gates, C. F. GRAND CHORUS.
   Tune the lay—tune the lay
      To the fair Georgina's praise;
   For to us her natal day
      Is the happiest of days.
   Ever blithe and ever gay
[200]      Be Georgina's natal day!
   Happy day! happy day!
   Happy, happy, happy day!                                          [Georgina descends from the canopy, and comes forward, C. Geo. [To the Peasantry.]
My friends, for your kind love, accept my thanks.
The pleasure now that sparkles in your eyes
Beguiles me of my grief, and makes me smile,
Though I have cause for sorrow.                                          [Exeunt Peasants, C. F. Count.
Heaven forbid
That sadness should, on this auspicious morn,
Obscure the sunshine of thy joy, my child! Geo.
Nor shall it, dearest father; for I know
You will retract your promise, nor compel me
To wed the odious Marquis Sapparino. Count.
Not wed the marquis!—Wherefore not, Georgina? Geo.
Because I cannot love him: the painted coxcomb
Ne'er was formed to make a woman happy;—
A wanton butterfly, who, in Love's garden,
Woos every flower, yet constant proves to none. Count.
My word, fair maid, is pledged; the contract signed,
[Page 15]

And every preparation duly made
To celebrate your nuptials with the marquis. Geo.
I've often heard you say, you loved my mother,
And as a jewel prized her for her truth:
I would but imitate her bright example,
And still prove faithful to my dear Fernando. Count.
[225]   A gallant youth, who perished on the field,
Fighting his country's battles. Come, my child,
Since grief is unavailing, banish sorrow,
And let thy lovely smiles again break forth. Geo. [Aside.]
Fernando! shall I never see thee more?                                          [Fernando looks out impatiently, and is about to rush from the alcove, but is prevented by Babbla and Sancho. Jer. [Coming from the gates, C. F.]
My lord, the noble Marquis Sapparino
Now leaves his carriage. Count.
Fly, and bid him welcome! Enter the Marquis Sapparino at the gates, C. F. Mar.
Bon jour, most worthy count!—Georgina, too!
My lovely bride, I must apologise
For this delay; a fatal accident
Having detained me long against my will. Count.
An accident! Mar.
You're often heard, no doubt, of Massaroni,
The brigand of the mountains. Geo.
I am told
He is a generous rover; one who takes,
Sans ceremonie, all the gold he can
From those who have too much, that he may help
With fortune's favours those who have too little.
He's said, besides, to be a handsome fellow. Mar.
Of that I cannot speak;—he and his band
Were masked when they attacked me. On a sudden,
Just at the entrance of the mountain pass,
“Halt!” cried the brigand chief: “your purse, my lord;
[250]   Surrender, or you die!” But, nothing daunted,
I, like a hero, from my carriage sprang,
And fought so bravely, that, in twenty minutes,
As many robbers on the earth lay stretched
Beneath my feet—some dead, and others dying. Geo.
Miraculous, indeed! Of course, my lord,
Your courage saved your purse? Mar.
No, by no means:
[Page 16]

I left it in the hands of Massaroni,
That the poor devils might employ a surgeon
To heal the wounds my valour had inflicted. Geo.
When you are dead, his holiness the Pope
Will doubtless canonize you, noble sir,
For your unbounded generosity. Mar.
If I am generous and valiant,
Are not the smiles of beauty my reward?
With such a bride as my adored Georgina,
The paragon of beauty and perfection— Geo.
No flattery, my lord, I beg of you:
It is the current coin 'twixt knaves and fools;—
And as, I trust, we do not class with either,
Let us in our commerce use no other
Than the pure, sterling ore of honesty. Mar.
Nought would I do to give offence to thee,
Beloved of my soul! [To the Count.] I hope, my lord,
[275]   All preparations have been duly made
To celebrate our nuptials on the morrow. Count.
All that a fond and doting father's heart
Could dictate, hath been done; nor care nor cost
Been spared to grace the joyous festival. Jer.
Aye, marry; and all under my directions.
The illuminated garden will outshine
The lamps above;—there's fountains spouting wine,
And such a dainty store of provender,
As never banquet yet was served withal.
In brief, my preparations are so ripe,
That no delay could make them more mature;
And if it please your noble excellencies,
The wedding may this night be celebrated. Re-enter Babbla from the alcove, L. U. E. Bab.
Not quite so fast, Jeromo, if you please! Count.
How now! what means this interruption, girl? Bab.
I crave your lordship's pardon. Was not
My honoured lady long since contracted
To Count Fernando? Geo. [Eagerly.]
What of him?—Oh, speak! Count.
Most truly was she. Mar.
But he is no more. Bab.
Are you quite sure of that? Mar.
Aye, positive;
I'll give you proof incontrovertible.
[Page 17]
Bab. [Apart to Georgina.]
[300]   Be comforted, my lady: Count Fernando
Is just returned, and will be here anon. Geo.
Oh, happy tidings!                                          [She becomes cheerful. Mar. [Calling off, L.]
What, ho! Ladroni! Enter Ladroni , L. Lad.
I am here, my lord. Mar.
Behold my valet—honest, brave Ladroni;
A fellow whose veracity is such,
That he would rather die by lingering tortures,
Than tell a wilful falsehood. Speak, Ladroni:
What know you of the gallant Count Fernando?
Is he not dead? Lad. [Taking out his handkerchief, and affecting great sorrow.]
Dead!—Ne'er shall I forget
The fatal day, when, in the field of battle,
He nobly breathed his last, pierced through and through
With fifty wounds, all mortal! Oh, 'twas shocking! Count.
Alas, poor youth! Mar.
What were his dying words? Lad.
With his last breath he cried, “Tell dear Georgina
'Tis my request that she do wed the brave,
The gallant, noble Marquis Sapparino.” Mar.
What more could you require? Lad.
Nay, that's not all.
The Count Fernando's servant, honest Sancho,
My bosom friend, was in the self-same battle
Slain by his master's side; and, ere he died,
[325]   He took my hand, and said, “My dear Ladroni,
You know my mistress Babbla: 'tis my wish
That you supply my place, and marry her.” Count Fernando and Sancho suddenly rush from the alcove, L. U. E.—Sancho knocks down Ladroni, and Fernando crosses to Georgina. Geo.
My dear Fernando! Fer. [Embracing her.]
My adored Georgina! San. [To Ladroni.]
Not a bad blow, methinks, for a dead man!
That's the reward of your veracity,
Honest Ladroni! Lad. [Apart to the Marquis.]
See what I've got by lying for my master!
[Page 18]
Count. [To the Marquis.]
Sir, this is most disgraceful. Pray explain. Geo.
I will explain, dear father. [Pointedly.] When the soul
Is void of honour, no means are then too base
To gain a wished-for end—not e'en a lie!
But since my dear Fernando is returned,
No power on earth shall separate us more;
For, in the face of heaven and of man,
I'll keep the vows that bind me to my love! Count.
Impossible! The marriage contract now
Is signed and sealed— Mar.
And safe within my power. Fer. [To the Marquis.]
Thou paltry, sneaking coward! Let the sword
Decide between us; for no forms of law,
By fraud obtained, shall shield thee from my arm.
Draw, and defend thyself!                                          [The Marquis retreats. San. [To Ladroni, imitating his master.]
Ay, draw, thou slave!                                          [Ladroni retreats behind Sapparino. Count. [Interposing.]
[350]   Put up your swords instantly! I command you! Mar.
Ladroni, come; attend me at my toilette. [To Fernando.]
Adieu, my fiery lover!—You're too late.
Ha! ha! ha! ha!—I have the contract here!
Ladroni, follow me. Adieu! adieu!                                          [Exeunt Sapparino, Ladroni, and Jeromo, at the gates, C. F. Count.
Exceedingly do I regret, Fernando,
That you arrived not sooner. Geo.
My dear father!
And can no means be possibly devised
To break this hated contract? Count.
None, my child.
My honour's pledged; besides, the penalty
Is heavy if I fail in its fulfilment. Geo.
Honour binds only with the honourable:
The marquis is a coxcomb and a coward. Count.
Give me but proof of that, and I, without
Delay, will break the marriage contract. Fer.
Did he not even now refuse to fight? Count.
I'll have no duelling, which, in my eyes,
At best is only honourable murder.
I ask some other proof. Suppose, for instance,
Our villa were this night to be attacked
[Page 19]

By Massaroni and his band of brigands,—
And such events we know are very common,—
Should then the marquis prove himself a coward,
[375]   And young Fernando here make stout resistance
In our defence, that would decide the point;
And he, and none but he, should wed my daughter,
E'en though the penalty were all my fortune.                                          [Exit, L. Geo.
Enough, dear father! [Calling.] Babbla! Bab. [Running forward.]
Yes, my lady; Geo. [After whispering to her.]
What think you of my plan? Bab. [Clapping her hands.]
'Tis excellent! Geo.
And will you join me in it? Bab.
Aye, my lady,
With heart and hand. Oh! I'm so delighted! Fer. [To Georgina.]
What plan is this? San. [To Babbla.]
Aye, tell me all about it. Geo. [To Fernando.]
Pray have a little patience! So, it seems,
Men are as fond of secrets as the women.
See, Babbla, with what eagerness they stand
On the tiptoe of curiosity!                                          [To Fernando, playfully.
You'd like to hear my plan, now—wouldn't you? Fer.
Most certainly, my love. San.
And so should I. Geo. [Mysteriously.]
Come hither, then, and listen with attention;
But, hush! for if you breathe one single syllable
Of what I now impart— Fer.
Not for the world! Geo.
Then you must know, that—upon second thoughts,
[400]   I'd wish you both to—have—a little patience! Fer.
Provoking! San.
How tormenting! Geo. & Bab. [Laughing.]
Ha! ha! ha! Geo. [Sarcastically.]
You gentlemen are not at all inclined
To fish for secrets—oh! not for the world!
'Tis women only who are curious!
Now, Babbla, fly, and execute my orders! Bab.
I will, my lady, with the speed of lightning. San. [Apart to Babbla.]
Come, you'll tell me the secret—won't you, Babbla? Bab.
Oh, certainly; but—have a little patience!                                          [Exeunt Babbla and Sancho at the gates, C. F.
[Page 20]
Geo.
Fernando, be not angry. Fer.
With Georgina?
How were that possible? And yet this secret— Geo.
Must still remain one, till it is betrayed
By tell-tale Time, who blabs out everything.
Yet trust me, love, whate'er I've planned, my object
Is to promote our mutual happiness. Fer. [Kneeling.]
That dear assurance blunts the eager spur
Of curiosity, and teaches patience
During your sov'reign pleasure. Geo. [Archly.]
How submissive!
That's as it should be! Men ne'er look so silly
As when they would be wise; affecting power,
Calling themselves the Lords of the Creation,
[425]   And boasting of their high prerogatives!                                          [Winningly giving him her hand.
Forgive me, dear Fernando!—When my tongue
Doth wanton most, my heart is most sincere. Fer.
To teaze and banter is Love's greatest pleasure. Geo.
And gives rare sport; that is, in modest measure.
I little thought this morning, when bright Phœbus
Gave me a glowing kiss, and chid me sluggard,
That his departing rays, when in the west
He gently sinks into his golden slumbers,
Would leave me happy as the nightingales
That carol him to rest! Yet, Heaven be praised!
The magic power of love—thy love, Fernando,
Hath caused rich joy to banquet in my heart.                                          [Hanging affectionately on his shoulder.
Full well I knew, if heaven contained thee not,
Thou wouldst again return to thy Georgina,
And be her heaven below! [They embrace.] Thus, reunited,
For all my griefs I richly am requited! DUET.— Georgina and Count Fernando . Geo.
   Love is the magnet of the soul,
      Which, wheresoe'er we roam,
   Fails not the passions to control,
      And draw the wand'rer home. Fer.
   Love guides the tender turtle dove
      O'er ocean, hill, and plain;
   Swift as the lightning from above,
      To seek his mate again.
[Page 21]
Geo.
[450]      Love—love alone gave Nature birth;
      Love blooms in ev'ry flower;
   Love smiles in sunshine on the earth,
      And weeps in ev'ry shower. Both.
   For love's the magnet of the soul,
      Which, wheresoe'er we roam,
   Fails not the passions to control,
      And draw the wand'rer home.                                          [Exeunt, C. F. SCENE II. —A Landscape. Enter Rosa , with a basket on her arm, L. Rosa.
How fortunate!—Count Dorio's fête to-day
Proved a good market for us flower-girls.
My basket's empty, and my purse is full.
How my poor mother will rejoice to hear
Of my success!—And now that I have money,
I'll buy a flask of wine to comfort her;
For poverty is grievous in old age.
There is to be a masquerade to-night;
So I'll run home, and get a fresh supply                                          [Going, R.
Of flowers for the motley company.
And while I sell them, I shall see the sports,
Uniting business with recreation.
Now, then, away to my dear, happy home! Enter Ladroni , hastily, with a letter, R., meeting her. Lad.
A word with you, my pretty little Flora. Rosa.
You are mistaken, sir; my name's not Flora. Lad.
It matters not, my love. Say, are not you
The pretty maid, who at Count Dorio's villa
Sold flowers to the guests? Rosa.
One of the maids
I am; but whether pretty, sir, or not,
Becomes not me to say. Lad.
What modesty!
I swear to thee by my veracity,
Thou art by far the fairest specimen
[25]   Of rustic beauty, Nature ever formed.
Pr'ythee, sweet sylvan nymph, what is thy name? SONG.— Rosa. Air , “How sweet are the flowers,” &c., from Tekeli.

   They call me young Rosa, the queen of the village,
      And many a lover and sweetheart have I
   'Mongst the lads, who forget the hard labour of tillage,
      If Rosa but gives them a smile for their sigh.
[Page 22]

   Then to market I speed, where the gentlemen gaze,
      And, with a kind smile, chuck me under the chin;
   While nodding and winking, my flowers they praise,
      And cry, “Here's my lodging, sweet Rosa—walk in!”

   But I answer No; and when all my flowers
      Are sold, I then bid the fine gentry adieu;
   And hie to my cottage, where, happy, my hours
      I pass with content, though our comforts are few.
   To father, and mother, and brother, I then
      Relate my adventures, and give all my gains;
   No queen half so happy, if Rosa again
      But meets in their smiles the reward of her pains. Lad.
Since Rosa is thy name, most charming rosebud,
Peruse this letter from my noble master,
The Marquis Sapparino. Rosa. [Taking the letter.]
What! the bridegroom
Of the Count Dorio's daughter, fair Georgina? Lad.
The very same. Rosa. [Opening the letter.]
What can he want with me? [Reading.]
[50]   “Sweet violet, blooming in obscurity—”
A singular beginning for a letter!                                          [Reads.
“The nosegay which I bought of thee this morning
Contained some beauteous flowers, but none so sweet
As thy dear self. I therefore long to wear thee,
Most charming of all rosebuds, in my bosom.
Come to the masquerade this evening,
Where we may have a tender interview,
Unknown and unobserved. My valet waits
Thy verbal answer—merely yes or no.
If yes, the gods might wish my bliss to share;
If no, my doom is madness and despair! “Marquis Sapperino.”

A most delightful letter, I declare! Lad.
What is your answer, pretty Rosa? Rosa.
Yes! Lad.
Enough; and as an earnest of his bliss,
My master ordered me to bring a kiss
From thy dear lips, or pluck a blooming rose
From off those lovely cheeks.                                          [Offers to kiss her. Rosa. [Boxing his ear.]
Then take it, coxcomb! Lad.
Oh, Jupiter! my cheek is all on fire! Rosa.
It is the rose your master ordered you
To bring him. [Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! Lad. [Aside.]
The little vixen! [Aloud.]
But you'll be sure to come? Rosa.
[75]   I answer, yes.
[Page 23]
Lad. [Aside, rubbing his cheek.]
To give a man of my veracity
Such striking proofs of her impertinence,
Is horrible! But I will have revenge!                                          [Exit, L. Rosa.
A pretty fellow, truly, is this marquis!
Just on the eve of marriage, too, to think
Of laying snares for a poor flower-girl,
Whose only fortune is her honesty!
But I'll expose the villain, when he dreams
Himself the most secure! This assignation
I'll punctually keep. A pretty rosebud
He calls me, and would wear me in his bosom!
The knave! but he shall rue his treachery:
As true as I a rustic maid was born,
I'll make him feel the rosebud hath its thorn!                                          [Exit, R. SCENE III. —An elegant Chamber in the Villa of Count Dorio—doors R. and L. Enter Count Fernando , R. Fer. [Calling.]
What ho! where art thou, Sancho?! Enter Sancho , L. San.
Here, my lord. Fer.
The brigand Massaroni hath been seen
Watching the guests now flocking to the villa,
To share Count Dorio's hospitality.
'Tis not unlikely but the lawless bandit
May venture an attack, in hopes of plunder. San.
We'll give him, if he dare, a warm reception! Fer.
See that Count Dorio's vassals be assembled,
And well instructed in the use of arms. San.
I shall obey, my lord. Fer.
What would I give
To see the brigands, like a mountain torrent,
Rush down upon the villa! It would then
Be seen who is a coward, and who is not. San.
If it so please your lordship, speak the word,
And I will fly like lightning to the mountains,
And, in your name, give Signor Massaroni
An invitation to the masquerade. Fer.
Peace, blockhead! If he came by accident,
It would rejoice me; but if at my bidding,
Were I not an accomplice in his crimes? San.
Most truly. I forgot that circumstance.
[Page 24]
Fer.
See that thou punctually obey my orders.
[25]   Fate! give me but an opportunity
Of wielding this good sword for dear Georgina,
And we are friends! Come, Sancho, follow me!                                          [Exit, L. San.
I come, my lord. And all I ask the gods
Is but a chance to show how I would fight,
In field or battery, by day or night,
On foot, on back of charger, mule, or poney,
For my dear Babbla, 'gainst this Massaroni!                                          [Exit, L. Enter Georgina and Babbla , R. Geo.
Have my commands been punctually obeyed? Bab.
Even, my lady, to the very letter. Geo.
What think you of my project, Babbla? say. Bab.
That it's well worthy of a woman's head,
But whether woman's heart hath resolution
To execute it, really I've my doubts. Geo.
Then banish them, and let bold certainty
Inspire thee with confidence. Why, girl,
Reflect: it is for sacred Love we fight,
And that dear name puts coward fear to flight.
Say, where are the fair candidates for fame? Bab.
They wait without. Geo.
Admit them instantly. Enter several young Ladies, the friends and companions of Georgina.
Companions of my youth, accept my thanks
For your prompt acquiescence in a plan
Inspired by love; and, although fraught with peril,
Still nothing to the noble resolution
[50]   That flashes from your eyes. Where danger threatens,
The brave fail not to reap a glorious harvest.
Say, are you willing then to follow me,
And boldly to the world your courage prove
In the defence of persecuted love? Ladies.
We are resolved! Geo.
Thanks—thanks, my gallant friends! FINALE.— Solo and Grand Chorus . Air , “All the blue bonnets are over the border.” SOLO.— Georgina.
   March! march! 'tis at young Cupid's call;
      Glory to her who her life for him loses!
   March! march! pretty maids one and all;
      No gallant youth will love her who refuses.
[Page 25]

   Then, without fear, let us on to the battle-field,
      There, amidst danger, to prove our affection;
   Never—no, never, not even in death, to yield,
      For valour it is that crowns love with perfection. GRAND CHORUS. [-Ladies]
   March! march! 'tis at young Cupid's call;
      Glory to her who her life for him loses!
   March! march! pretty maids one and all;
      No gallant youth will love her who refuses.                                          [Georgina places herself at the head of her companions, and they march off, L. U. E.

END OF ACT I.
ACT II. SCENE I. —The Ruins of an old Abbey, by Moonlight, R. U. E.—a gate and windows, through which a light is seen—a guitar hanging near the ruins. Enter Rosa , with a basket of flowers, L. Rosa.
My basket is replenish'd with choice flowers,
So I'll away to see the masquerade.                                          [As she is crossing to R., females are heard laughing loudly in the ruins.
Bless me! what sounds of revelry were those
In yonder abbey? Ha! I see a light!
The nunnery has not been inhabited
For many years. [Laughing repeated.] Goodness! what can this mean?                                          [She looks through the keyhole of the door.
Oh, Gemini! what mischief's now afloat?
Ha! Georgina and her young companions
Dressing themselves a such a strange attire,
That—But I'll hide, for here the lady comes.                                          [She conceals herself behind the ruins, R. U. E. Enter Georgina from the ruins, R., in the costume of the brigand Massaroni. Geo. [Drawing a pistol, as if stopping a traveller.]
—Stand and deliver, traveller, or you die!
What! you've no money? Swear it by the saints!
Poor fellow! take this purse; for Massaroni
Robs but those who rob their fellow-creatures;
Glutting themselves upon the widow's substance,
The orphan's birthright. Such it is his glory
[Page 26]

To fleece, as they fleece others. Now, farewell;
And if the privileged robbers of this world
Should ask thee where the brigand Massaroni
Can be found, reply, that in the mountains
He dwells with honour and humanity! [Aside.]
Come, that, I think, is not so much amiss! Rosa. [Aside, peeping from the ruins.]
No, for a miss , it certainly is not! Geo.
There's something quite inspiring in this dress;
[25]   I feel myself courageous as a lion! SONG.— Georgina.

   A soldier's life, as I've been told,
      Is one that's full of glee;
   To dress so smart, and look so bold,
      Is just the thing for me.
   Then to the drum and fife so shrill,
   March, march away I will;
   Yes! to the drum and fife so shrill,
   March, march away I will!

   To fight against the tyrant foe
      In Freedom's sacred cause,
   Is just the very way, I know,
      To gain my friends' applause.
   Then to the drum and fife so shrill,
   March, march away I will;
   Yes; to the drum and fife so shrill,
   March, march away I will! Rosa. [Coming forward, mimicking Georgina.]
“March, march away, I won't!” Geo. [Aside.]
Here comes a country girl, the pretty Rosa.
I'll frighten her, and then make love to her.                                          [Aloud, in a gruff voice.
How dare you, girl, at this untimely hour,
Cross Massaroni's path? Rosa.
Because I know
He is too generous to harm a poor
And unoffending little flower girl. Geo.
[50]   Be not too sure of that. But tell me, damsel,
Didst ever see the brigand Massaroni? Rosa.
Never; but I have often heard of him. Geo. [In a menacing attitude.]
He stands before thee now! Rosa. [Coolly.]
You don't say so? Geo. [Aside.]
The saucy minx! she surely cannot know me? [Aloud.]
Thou dost not tremble, then. Rosa.
Tremble!—Oh, no!
I don't know why I should, I'm sure.
[Page 27]
Geo.
Thou'rt right,
Fair maid! I love the gentle sex. Rosa. [Aside.]
No doubt: self-love's the first of nature's laws! Geo.
Tell me, what think you of Massaroni? Rosa. [Roguishly regarding Georgina.]
Oh, he's well enough, if he had a beard. Geo.
Psha! simpleton!—He is as yet quite young. Rosa.
I see he is;—so young, that were he dressed
In petticoats, he'd look just like myself. Geo. [Aside.]
What a sharp eye the little vixen has! [Aloud.]
No matter how he looks; he is resolved
To have a kiss of you, at all events. Rosa.
With all my heart, miss; twenty, if you please. Geo.
Miss!—Thou saucy little rogue! what mean ye? Rosa.
I crave your pardon, Signor Massaroni;
But having two such pretty pouting lips,
A face so smooth, so sweet, so languishing,
[75]   I took you for a gentle love-lorn lady. Geo.
Thou art mistaken, silly girl! 'Tis I,—
I who make the proudest princes tremble!
Massaroni is in war a lion,
Dealing destruction on his enemies;
In peace a lamb, courting the gentle arts
Of poetry and music. [Fetching the guitar.] Come, listen. SONG.— Georgina. Air , “ Love's Ritornella .” 2
      Gentle Rosabella, whither away?
      Love's ritornella list while I play.
   Know thou hast linger'd too long on the road;
   Night is advancing—the brigand's abroad.
      Pretty Rosabella, whither away?
      Love's ritornella list while I play!
      Charming Rosabella, pray do not fear;
      Night is not darker than thy raven hair;
   And those starry eyes, which the brigand doth see,
   Makes him a captive—a robber of thee!
      Gentle Rosabella, whither away?
      Love's ritornella list while I play!
      Simple Rosabella, beware—oh! beware!
      List ye no ditty, grant ye no prayer:
   To thy light footsteps let terror add wings;
   'Tis Massaroni himself who now sings.                                          [Rosa shakes her head.
      Gentle Rosabella, pray do not fear;
      Love's ritornella tarry and hear!
[Page 28]
Rosa.
[100]   Delightful, I declare! Really, signor,
Methinks that singing better far becomes
You than blustering and fighting. Geo. [Angrily.]
Beware
Of Massaroni's frown; for, with the speed
Of lightning, whene'er he gives the signal,
His daring band of brigands all rush forth,
Ready to execute their chief's command.                                          [Whistling.
Behold, and tremble! Enter Babbla and Female Brigands from the ruins. Bab. [To Georgina.]
Captain, your pleasure? Rosa. [Laughing.]
Captain!—Ha! ha! ha! Geo. [Sternly.]
Girl! thy impudence deserves correction!                                          [They all flourish their stilettos. Rosa.
I pray you, ladies, do not look so fierce:
Such Massaroni's will not frighten me! Geo. [Aside.]
Confusion! then our secret is discovered! Rosa.
In passing yonder ruins, a glimmering
Light I saw; a merry peal of laughter
Struck mine ear; and, peeping slyly through
That crazy lock, I found—hey presto! found
The key to all your hidden mysteries! Geo.
'Twas true love's last resource; and as you hope
One day to get a husband, I charge you,
Be secret!                                          [She whispers to Rosa. Rosa.
Rely on my discretion. SOLO, DUETTO, and CHORUS. Air , “How happy could I be with either.” SOLO.— Georgina. [To Rosa.]
   'Tis true, for a time we are rovers;
[125]         Yet I trust it will never be said,
   That a female play'd false with true lovers;
      If you do, may you die an old maid! SOLO.— Rosa. [To the fair Brigands.]
   Fear not, my dear, sweet little rovers;
      Of me it shall never be said,
   That I ever play'd false with true lovers;
      If I do, may I die an old maid! DUETTO AND CHORUS. Geo. and Rosa.
   'Tis true, for a time we are rovers,
   Fear not, my dear, sweet little rovers, Geo., Rosa.
      Yet I trust it will/never be said,
      Of me it shall/never be said, Geo., Rosa.
   That a female/play'd false with true lovers;
   That I ever/play'd false with true lovers; Geo., Rosa.
      If you/do, may you/die an old maid!
      If I/do, may I/die an old maid!
[Page 29]
Chorus.
   'Tis true, for a time we are rovers,
      Yet we trust it will never be said,
   That a female play'd false with true lovers;
      If she does, may she die an old maid!                                          [Exit Rosa, R. Geo.
This accident must not discourage us.
Had not that littie vixen played the spy,
I would defy her e'en to have surmised
We are not what we seem. These dresses well
Become us;—you know they all were made
To grace this night our merry masquerade.
[150]   But now for exercise. Are you armed
At all points with pistols and stilettos? Bab.
We are, my lady— [Checking herself.] Captain, I should say! Geo.
It is well known that Massaroni's warfare
Is, like himself, wild and irregular;
Still something like true tactics now and then
He doth observe, and so must we. Attention!                                          [As Georgina commands, the fair brigands obey.
Prepare your stilettos! now to the charge!                                          [They rush forward in line.
Halt! to the right about! retreat in order!
March! halt, front!—Now draw your pistols, brigands!
Make ready—present—fire!                                          [Georgina fires—the rest hesitate. [Angrily.]
Ha! confusion!
You dare to disobey your captain's orders? Bab.
We beg your pardon, and have no objection
To fight with steel; but really we're afraid
To meddle with gunpowder. Geo. [With authority.]
At your peril,
Dare hesitate! Bab.
Well, if we must, we must. Geo.
You know the pistols have by my direction
Been charged with powder only; since our object
Is not to kill, but terrify a coward.
Attention, brigands! Make ready! present! fire!                                          [They fire a volley.
That was well done! Now, comrades, stand at ease;
And, to beguile the hour until 'tis time
[175]   To march to the attack, we'll have a dance
In the true brigand style. Omnes.
Agreed! agreed!
[Page 30]
A NEAPOLITAN BOLERO, WITH CASTANETS. SOLO.— Georgina, à la Bolero.
            When the merry bells are ringing,
            And the little lambs are springing;
            When the birds are blithly singing,
         Sweetly sipping from life's flowing measure;
            When the village lads are straying,
            And the shepherd's pipe is playing,
         Then's the time for harmony and pleasure! Chorus of the fair Brigands, while dancing with castanets.
            Fal, lal, lal, lal, la, &c. Georgina.
            When the village dames are talking,
            When old fathers go a walking,
            And there is no fear of baulking,
         Then begins the frolicing and sporting;
            When in silent bower reclining,
            And the silver moon is shining,
         Then's the witching hour for love and courting! Chorus (with dance)
            When the merry bells are ringing, &c.                                          [At the end of the Bolero, the bell of a distant convent strikes nine. Geo.
Attention, comrades!—Hark! the convent bell
Hath struck the hour of nine. On to glory! CHORUS.— Air , “ Blue Bonnets over the Border .”
   March! march!—'tis at young Cupid's call;
      Glory to her who her life for him loses!
   March! march! pretty maids one and all;
      No gallant youth will love her who refuses!                                          [Georgina places herself at the head of the fair Brigands, and they exeunt, R., marching in military order. SCENE II. —An Ante-Chamber in the Villa. Enter the Count de Dorio , the Marquis Sapparino , and Jeromo , L. Count.
My daughter left the villa, didst thou say? Jer.
To take an evening promenade, my lord,
Attended by her maid and fair companions. Count.
The time's ill chosen; for should the brigand,
Massaroni, and his band surprize them,
They'll prove so rich a booty, the treasures
Of a dukedom would not pay the ransom. Mar. [Coming forward.]
Spake you of Massaroni, noble sir?
[Page 31]

If he dare make prisoner of Georgina,
I'll give him such a ransom with my sword,
As very soon shall make him cry “pecavi!”
Therefore no compromise, my lord, I pray,
Or you'll offend my valour. Count.
I rejoice
To find my future son-in-law so brave;
For I detest a coward in my soul.
Come, Jeromo; my honoured guests e'en now
Assemble in the banquet hall, to share
The sports. [To Sapparino.] We shall expect you there.                                          [Exeunt Count Dorio and Jeromo, R. Mar.
Anon, my most noble father-in-law! [Calling off, R. S. E.]
What ho! Ladroni! Enter Ladroni , R. S. E. Lad.
I am here, my lord. Mar.
Didst overtake the little flower-girl,
The charming Rosa? Lad.
[25]   After a hard chase,
I did, my lord. Mar.
What said she to my letter? Enter Rosa , L. S. E., listening. Lad.
Kissed it a thousand times, and then cried,
“Yes!” Mar. [Delighted.]
Dear, lovely girl!—Then she is sure to come? Lad.
As sure as fate. Mar.
Such charms! such modesty! Lad.
Don't be certain of that, my lord. Mar.
Why, knave?
Dost dare assert that Rosa is not honest? Lad.
The saints forbid! I only asked a kiss— Mar.
Which she most properly refused. Lad.
I pray you,
Regard me well, my lord—this graceful mein;
Then ask yourself, if it were possible
For any woman to refuse a kiss
To one so handsome as your serving man? Mar.
Thou'rt a conceited coxcomb! Lad.
As I said,
I asked a kiss; and—would you credit it?
She gave me twenty; called me her love, and
Swore that I was—
[Page 32]
Rosa. [Suddenly stepping between them.]
A scurvy, lying knave! Mar.
Ah! charming Rosa! Rosa.
[50]   I insist, my lord,
That you compel yon varlet to retract
His foul aspersions on my reputation. Mar. [Drawing his sword.]
He shall do so, or I will run him through!                                          [Ladroni falls on his knees. Rosa.
My lord, I will myself dictate the terms
Of the vile slanderer's recantation. Mar. [Pointing his sword at Ladroni.]
Thou knave! repeat fair Rosa's words, or die! Rosa. [Dictating to Ladroni, who repeats each line after her.]
I, Miguel Ladroni, do declare,
That what I have said against the fair fame
Of Rosa Coralli, the flower-girl,
Was but a tissue of the foulest slander,
And base, unfounded lies!—And this I swear
Is true, as I am a boasting liar! Rosa.
Enough! I'm satisfied. Lad. [Aside, rising.]
That's more than I am! Mar. [To Ladroni.]
Go, sirrah, and prepare my domino,
Then await my coming. Lad. [Going.]
I obey, my lord.                                          [Aside, pointing to Rosa.
Though I'm a liar, I'll for once speak true:
When next I shrive, I'll not confess to you.                                          [Exit, R. Mar.
Most charming Rosa! fairest of all flowers! Rosa.
Fairer than your beautiful Georgina? Mar.
We will not mention her just now, my dear;
But talk a little of our love intrigue. Rosa.
Fie! my lord. I must go sell my flowers. Mar.
[75]   I'll buy them, and with them thy sweet self. [Giving her a purse.]
Will this suffice? Rosa.
For what, most noble sir? Mar.
To buy thy flowers. Rosa.
Aye, a hundred times. Mar.
But to buy you? Rosa.
Not all that you possess!                                          [Throwing the purse at him indignantly.
Take back your purse! The price of innocence
Is nothing less than honourable wedlock! Mar. [Aside, pocketting the purse.]
A little preacher, this, in petticoats! [Aloud.]
Be not angry, Rosa;—sell thy flowers,
And meet me at the masquerade.—Adieu!                                          [Exit, C. D. F.
[Page 33]
Rosa.
Yes, I will go; and it shall be my task,
Before them all a villain to unmask!                                          [Exit, R. SCENE III. —The Banquet Hall—folding-doors, C. F. Jeromo and Domestics discovered making preparations for the masquerade. Jer.
Come, bustle, bustle, idle knaves! our guests
Will speedily arrive. The wine and fruits
Place on this table, and the flower vases
On yon buffet; but with all due regard
To taste and symmetry. There, that will do!                                          [Festive music heard without.
Now fly! begone! open the folding-doors!
For, hark! the motley company draws near.                                          [Exeunt Servants, running, L., followed by Jeromo. Music .—Enter the Count de Dorio , in his own dress, introducing Masquerade Characters; amongst them the Marquis Sapparino, Ladroni, Count Fernando, Sancho, Rosa , &c. Count.
Welcome, my honoured guests!—Let mirth and joy
Tune every heart to sweetest harmony. [Aside.]
Like many a priest, I find it easier far
To preach than practice: my joy is marred
By my daughter's absence. Fer.
Where's Georgina,
The banquet's pride and brightest ornament? Count.
She went to take an evening promenade
Into the orange grove that skirts the villa,
And hath not yet returned. Fer.
Imprudent girl!
By night—unguarded—and at the time
When Massaroni, by most sure report,
Is lurking near the spot! Fare you well,
Most noble signors and signoras all!
I'll watch the footsteps of the lovely maid,
And safely guide her to her father's arms,
[25]   Or perish for her sake! Sancho, to horse!                                          [Exit, C. D. F. San.
I come, my lord. [To Jeromo.] But where's my dear Babbla? Jer.
Go to, thou shallow pate!—Where should she be,
But with her mistress? San.
And ere this, mayhap,
In Massaroni's power. That thought is madness!
[Page 34]
Fernando. [Without.]
Sancho! to horse, I say! San.
I come, my lord!
And now, brim full of rage, I'll mount my poney,
And take revenge on this vile Massaroni!                                          [Exit, C. D. F. Mar. [Coming forward with Rosa.]
E'en let my silly rival, Count Fernando,
Go fight with Massaroni: I've a magnet
To me far more attractive. Charming Rosa!
Now's the time for our little tête-à-tête. Rosa.
Such liberties would ill become a guest
So humble as myself, without permission
Of the most noble master of the villa.                                          [Calling loudly.
Count Dorio, and his worthy company,
A word with you, I crave.                                          [Courtsies. Mar. [Aside.]
Confound the jilt! Lad. [Apart to the Marquis.]
What think you of her now, my lord?—What charms!
How innocent!                                          [The Count and guests come forward. Count. [To Rosa.]
What wouldst thou, pretty maid? Rosa.
Tell me, noble sir: is not yon marquis
Betrothed to your fair daughter? Count.
[50]   Truly is he. Rosa.
Then, my good lord, that you may know the man
Who is to be your future son-in-law,
Peruse that letter. [Handing it.] On the eve of marriage,
He could not better occupy his time
Than in attempts to ruin a poor girl,
Whose only fortune is her innocence! Count. [To the Marquis, after reading the letter.]
—What means this villany? Mar. [Coolly.]
'Tis gallantry!
In this refined and fashionable age,
Such little love intrigues are all the rage. Count.
My daughter's hand, my lord, shall ne'er be yours. Mar.
Perhaps not. Her fortune I am sure of:
Look ye, here is the marriage contract! Count. [Aside.]
Fool that I was to act so thoughtlessly! [To the guests.]
I do entreat of you, my honoured guests,
Let not this mar your present harmony.
Minstrels, strike up, and drown a father's cares! Music .—A CHARACTERISTIC BALLET.                                          [The ballet is interrupted by the report of fire-arms, and the screams of females without.
[Page 35]
Re-enter Jeromo , hastily, C. D. F. Jer.
Suspend your festive mirth, and save yourselves!
Fly—fly! 'tis the brigand Massaroni!                                          [Music.—General consternation—the company scamper off—the Marquis Sapparino creeps under the table. Enter Georgina , C. D. F., as the Brigand Chief, followed by Babbla , as her principal Officer, and the rest of the Fair Brigands, firing off their pistols.—Ladroni is about to escape—Georgina seizes him by the collar, drags him back, and he falls on his knees. Geo. [In a gruff voice.]
Who art thou, fellow? Lad.
A poor honest servant. Geo.
Who is thy lord? Lad.
The Marquis Sapparino. Geo.
The coward knave of whom I come in search!
[75]   Where is he? [Presenting a pistol.] Speak! or I'll make thee tremble! Lad. [Loudly.]
Not for the world would I betray my master! [In a whiper.]
Look under yonder table! Geo. [Going to the table.]
Come forth, thou
Recreant coward!—Answer for thy crimes
To Massaroni, and beg for mercy!                                          [She pulls him from under the table by the ear. Mar. [On his knees.]
Oh! mercy—mercy! good Signor Brigand! Geo.
Most truly, now, thou art a valiant knight!
Is this the gallant Marquis Sapparino?
The desperate swordsman, who, in twenty minutes,
Can slay as many brigands? I have heard
Of your vain boasting, sir; and now demand
That you make good your words. [Producing a brace of pistols.] Come, take your choice,
And fight me on the spot, or own yourself
A coward! [Pointing to Ladroni.] Yonder base knave, your valet,
May be your second. Lad.
No; with your good leave,
I'll not be second in this desp'rate strife,
But first—to run and save my precious life!                                          [Exit, C. D. F. Geo. [To Sapparino.]
No matter; you can fight without a second.
[Page 36]
Mar.
I have no wish to murder any man,
Far less a gentleman so much respected
As Signor Massaroni. Here's my purse,
Well lined with gold, if that will satisfy you;
But I entreat you, use no violence,
[100]   And, above all, do not derange my person. Geo.
Thou painted butterfly! put up thy purse;
For Massaroni scorns to rob a wretch
So poor, so utterly contemptible as thou! Mar.
Ah! how generous!                                          [Footsteps heard without. Bab. [Looking off.]
Dispatch him, captain;
The villa is alarmed. Geo. [Cocking her pistol.]
Then he must die! Mar. [Trembling.]
And will you take no ransom? Geo.
None!—Prepare!
Yet stay!—On one condition thou may'st live. Mar.
Name it; I will consent to all you ask. Geo.
Know, then, that Massaroni is the friend
Of persecuted lovers. I have heard,
With indignation just, that you aspire
To wed the daughter of Count Dorio,
Although her heart you know can ne'er be yours.
Your claim indeed is lawful, for you hold
The contract in your hand; but I, who set
Laws at defiance, do demand of you
Immediate surrender of the deed. Mar. [Aside.]
What a ferocious tiger! [To Georgina.] I do obey.
Signor, here is the marriage contract. Geo. [Taking the deed.]
'Tis well; yet even this is not enough.
Luckily, I see on yonder table
[125]   Pens, ink, and paper ready. [Giving them to him.] —Come, write,
Most noble lord, write what I shall dictate. Mar. [Aside, kneeling, and taking the pen.]
Shall I? Geo.
No hesitation, or you die! [Dictating.]
I, Guido Sapparino, do for ever
Renounce all claim to Georgina's hand;
And do confess myself a poltroon and
A coward! Mar. [Throwing down the pen.]
No, no, signor; that's too bad! Geo. [Threatening.]
Not worse than being shot!—Write, sir, or die!
[Page 37]
Mar. [After writing.]
'Tis done, most generous Signor Massaroni! Geo.
Ha! 'tis well! I came not here to plunder:
I am satisfied. Now will I retire. Mar. [Aside, going.]
And so will I! Geo. [Pulling him back.]
And is it thus, my lord,
You'd leave the company of a gentleman,
Sans ceremony? Mar. [Bowing reluctantly.]
Sir, I crave your pardon!
Adieu, most noble Signor— [Aside.] A'Diable! Geo. [Imitating him.]
Adieu, most noble marquis! a revoir! Mar. [Aside.]
Not for ten thousand crowns! Now, then, my legs,
Be true as gold, and swift as lightning!                                          [Exit, running, R. Omnes. [Laughing.]
Ha! ha! ha! Geo. [In her natural voice.]
Well, ladies, I must say you've done your duty
Most admirably. All goes bravely on;
[150]   And never was a desperate enterprise
Crowned with success more brilliant! Voices. [Without.]
On! on! Count Fernando. [Without.]
Come, follow me into the banquet-hall! Bab. [Pointing off, R.]
Behold! the Count Fernando comes this way. Geo.
Then, Babbla, we must instantly retreat.
Now, comrades, to the right about face—march!                                          [Music.—Georgina and the rest retreat in good order, L. SCENE IV. —A Landscape. Enter Georgina, Babbla , and the rest of the Fair Brigands, hastily, R. S. E. Geo.
Halt, comrades!—Now to cover our retreat.
Make ready—present—fire!                                          [They fire off, L. Bab.
Plenty of smoke, my lady, but no danger;
Since our pistols are but charged with powder. Voices. [Without.]
Follow! follow! Geo.
They come!—Now to the abbey ruins—march!                                          [Exeunt, L. S. E. Enter Count Fernando, Count Dorio, Sancho, Jeromo , and Vassals, hastily, in pursuit, R. S. E. Fer.
This way, my friends. [To Count Dorio.] You say my dear Georgina
Hath not returned?
[Page 38]
Count.
Alas! I grieve to say,
We've heard no tidings of her, and I fear,
Lest Massaroni should have crossed her path. San.
And my dear Babbla, too? Jer.
No doubt of it.
Babbla is as true to her fair mistress— San.
As I to my good master. Fer.
Cease prating;
And follow to the rescue of my love!                                          [Exit, L. S. E. San.
To the world's end! [Flourishing his sword.] —Now, then, for love and glory!                                          [Exeunt, L. S. E. Enter Rosa , R., followed by Ladroni , with his head bound up. Rosa.
I hope your wound, poor fellow, is not mortal! Lad.
Alas! I feel it is. Rosa.
How did it happen? Lad.
In fighting beside my honoured, noble master,
That rascal Massaroni fired his pistol
Point blank into my face; right through my head
[25]   The bullet flew! Enter the Marquis Sapparino , R. S. E., unseen by Rosa and Ladroni. Rosa.
What a calamity!
Let me examine if the wound be serious. Lad.
'Tis useless, pretty Rosa; mortal aid
Can now avail me nothing, for by this
Time to-morrow, I shall be meat for worms! Rosa.
The saints forbid! Come, I will be your doctor. Lad.
'Tis of no use! Rosa.
Yes, but I say I will!                                          [She unties the handkerchief, Ladroni endeavours to prevent her.
Oh, what a dreadful wound!—Why, as I live,
I cannot even see the slightest scratch! Mar. [Stepping between them.]
Why, thou poltroon! didst thou not run away? Lad.
Yes, I ran to fetch—more ammunition.                                          [Exit, L. Mar.
The miserable coward!—I alone
Bore the whole brunt of the tremendous conflict! Rosa.
Aye, on your knees; for you must know, my lord,
That I peeped through the key-hole all the time. Mar.
You did! [Aside.] The little vixen! [Aloud.] Hush, dear Rosa!
[Page 39]

Speak not a word of what you saw, I pray!
Besides, I'm engaged just now.—Adieu!                                          [Exit, hastily, L. Rosa. [Calling after him.]
Stay, stay!—Where is your marriage contract?
The paper that the brigand made you sign? [Laughing.]
Ha! ha! ha!                                          [Exit, R. SCENE V. —The Abbey Ruins, as before. Enter Count Fernando, Sancho, Count Dorio, Jeromo, Rosa , Vassals, Peasants, and Attendants, L. San. [To Fernando.]
This way, my lord; the brigands have retreated
To yon abbey ruins. Fer.
Surround the pile,
And we will quickly force them to surrender!                                          [He advances fiercely to the ruins, R. U. E.
Yield thee, thou daring outlaw, Massaroni!
Or die a rebel and a traitor!                                          [The abbey gate opens. Enter Georgina and the Female Brigands, in long cloaks and brigand hats—they sally forth, presenting their pistols. Geo.
Never
Will Massaroni yield while life remains! Fer.
Then take thy just reward! [To the Vassals.] —What ho! make ready!
Present!— Geo.
Tut! tut!—Think not to frighten me:
For know, that Georgina and her companions
Are still within my power. Fire on us,
Their death is certain! Count. [To Fernando.]
Forbear! for mercy's
Sake, forbear! [To Georgina.] Name but the ransom, brigand,—
Take all my gold—take all I have on earth,
But give me back my child! Geo.
I ask no ransom:
Give your fair daughter to Count Fernando,
And the bold mountain brigand is content. Fer.
Now, by my sword, thou art a gen'rous foe! Count.
Gladly would I comply with thy demand,
But that my daughter is by contract bound
[25]   To the coward Marquis Sapparino.
[Page 40]
Geo.
To wring that contract from a villain's grasp
I made th' attack this night upon your villa. [Holding up the deed.]
See, my lord, 'tis here! Take it, Fernando!                                          [Gives him the contract.
Accept it from the hand of Massaroni! Fer.
Would that all honest men were but as brave
As the bold brigand chief! Geo.
No compliments.                                          [Giving a paper to Count Dorio.
Here is, besides, another document,
In which your brave intended son-in-law,
The marquis, doth confess himself a coward. Count. [After perusing the paper.]
'Tis even so!—Now, generous brigand,
Where is my child, the lovely Georgina?                                          [Georgina and her companions throw off their disguise. Geo.
Here, noble sire—the Female Massaroni!                                          [Count Dorio presents Georgina to Fernando, and Babbla rushes into the arms of Sancho, amidst the shouts and huzzas of the Peasantry and Attendants. GRAND CHORUS.—FINALE.
   Happy pair! happy pair!
   Hymen take you to his care;
   And the sunshine of your joy

THE APOSTATE, A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS
[Page iii]
Front matter
PREFACE. Sismondi gives a detailed account of a tragedy by Calderon, called, “Love after Death; or, The Mountains of Grenada,” and founded upon the revolt of the Moors against Philip the Second. It is an historical play, and embraces the principal events during a warfare of three years.
The political condition of the Moors, as described by Calderon, appeared to the author to be highly dramatic. He has not consciously adopted a single incident in the plot, or line in the composition of the Spanish Poet, but has endeavoured to catch his general tone and colouring in depicting the detestation which the cruelty of the Spaniards had naturally generated in the Moors. He mentions this to relieve himself from the imputation of having sought the illegitimate assistance of political allusion; and he hopes that, upon reflecting on the nature of the subject, the reader will consider the introduction of the Inquisition as unavoidable. It would be hard, indeed, to write a play upon any event in the reign of Philip the Second, without inveighing against the persecutor and the tyrant. It would be impossible, in the present instance. If it be a fault, Schiller and Alfieri have fallen into it. It would be a very strange delicacy, indeed, were the author to spare the guilt, the ferocity, and the baseness of Philip, out of respect to such a man as the present King of Spain!
It has been also said that he is greatly indebted to the performers. He is, indeed, indebted, and most grateful to them. Who must not be under great obligations to such an unprecedented union of varied excellence as the proprietors of Covent-Garden
[Page iv]
have brought together? The dignity,—the pathos, —the subdued and cultivated genius of Mr. Young; the fine countenance, the graceful movement, and the impassioned tenderness of Mr. C. Kemble; the just conception and the admirable execution of Mr. M'Cready, who, by his great powers, succeeded in counteracting the odium which such a character as Pescara was calculated to create;—these would impose obligation upon writers to whose talents the author does not aspire.—Of Miss O'Neill he forbears to say any thing—she finds her eulogy in tears—those evidences of tragic superiority to which Athens gave the palm.
It is not only to the performers in this tragedy that the author owes his thanks—he returns them to Mr. Fawcett, for his zealous and judicious superintendence of the preparation of his tragedy, and his gentleman-like attentions towards himself.
Mr. Bishop assisted the Author by two of those delightful airs which he only can produce.
He cannot conclude without expressing his warm acknowledgments for the liberality of the proprietors in sparing no expense, and for their great personal politeness.
The metre will be occasionally found incomplete, as the play is published from the prompt-book. The passages omitted in representation were not considered by the author as worthy of publication.

TO MISS O'NEILL. Madam
I AM indebted to you for the zealous and brilliant exertion of your rare talents, in the performance of this Tragedy— for the kind and judicious sugestions which I derived from your dramatic taste and knowledge, in the course of its composition,—and I inscribe it to you—
I have the honour to be, Madam, Your most obedient and faithful Servant, RICHARD SHEIL.

PROLOGUE. ( WRITTEN BY WILLIAM WALLACE, ESQ. ) SPOKEN BY Mr. CONNOR . [By Wallace, W.]
Various the realms, and boundless are the views,
Where Fancy wanders with the Tragic Muse.
What spot to-night, o'er that expansive sphere,
Wakes manhood's sympathy—asks woman's tear?
'Tis Spain,—the land where oft, enthron'd sublime,
Shone Muse-lov'd Chivalry in olden time!
'Tis Spain—where late Britannia's conqu'ring hand
Unmanacled the Genius of the land.
Glory's bright beacon, lighted once again,
Bade prostrate Europe blush, and burst her chain;
And gave the world that noblest Chivalry,
Of reas'ning man—immortal Liberty!
What time stern Philip's ruthless edict fell
With persecution, and her band of hell,
In frantic ruin o'er the Moorish race—
Our Poet chose his fancied scene to trace.
He there presents, in virtue's bold relief,
A Moorish lover and a Moorish chief;
And shews a villain rob'd in guilt, in shame,
Altho' the villain bear the Christian name;
Convinc'd, when man in virtue's light you view,
Alike the Crescent or the Cross to you!
But not alone those springs, whose strong control
With ruder force can wake and vex the soul,
He tries—but still, in softer strains, would prove
That dearer spell of mightier pow'r to move,—
A woman's sorrows, and a woman's love!
[Page x]

One praise at least he claims to bless his lays—
Nor scene immoral, nor offensive phrase,
Wounds the chaste ear of virgin Modesty—
Quells the pure ardour of young Beauty's eye,
Or spreads the crimson of ingenuous shame
On outrag'd Innocence's cheek of flame!
Next—tho' a foreign land the scene supply'd—
Think not he chose a foreign Muse his guide:—
Spurning wild Germany's uncultur'd schools,
And self-pleas'd Gallia's boasted borrowed rules,
A native Muse, to-night, by native arts,
Would please your judgments and subdue your hearts.
And this, her simple suit, by me she sends—
Give British justice!—yet—as British friends!

[Page 1]
Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A Moorish Apartment in Grenada. Enter Hemeya, Hamet, and Haly. Hem.
It is in vain—you talk to me in vain. Ham.
Have you forgot that you are last of all
The race of famous kings who ruled Grenada
Before the Spaniard conquer'd? In their slavery,
The Moors still hold you for their righteous prince;
And, in return for kingly reverence,
You owe them kingly care. Haly.
Once, I remember,
The wrongs our Christian tyrants heap upon us
Could fire your soul with rage.—Aloud you cried
Against the treach'rous breach of ev'ry right
That Ferdinand secured; but now, when fame
Has told abroad, that Philip will blot out
The very name of Moor, and has decreed
To rob us of our faith, our nation's rites,
Our sacred usages, and all that men
[Page 2]

Hold dearer far than life,—this fatal passion
Has bound you like a spell. Ham.
This Spanish woman
Has banish'd from your soul each nobler care.—
The daughter of Alvarez—she alone
Possesses all your being! You can think
And speak but of Florinda—When the Moors
Weep o'er their cruel wrongs, Aben Hemeya,
[25]   Amid the assembled council sits enrapt,
And, in a lengthen'd sigh, breathes out “Florinda!” Hem.
Oh! blame me not, it is my cruel fate!
I feel this passion, like necessity,
Rule my o'ermaster'd soul. What can you say?
Is there a pow'r in eloquence or reason
To cure the heart's deep malady?—Ha! tell me,
Have you e'er seen her face? have you beheld
That rare assemblage of all nature's beauties?
Ah! have you ever seen her? Where is the remedy
For passion like to mine? Hal.
You should have found it,
If not in duty, in despair.—You know
Our Spanish tyrants spurn as well as hate us—
Would not Alvarez deem it infamy
That e'en a Moorish prince should wed Florinda?
When you approach his palace, ev'ry slave,
The menials of his threshold, cry, in scorn,
“Behold the Moor!”
And e'en the fair Florinda
Has ne'er confessed she smiles upon your passion.
And yet you love—
[Page 3]
Hem.
And must love on for ever.
Love is a fire self-fed, and does not need
Hope to preserve its flame. Full well I know
[50]   I must despair—and yet, when I behold her,
And her blue eyes are lifted— Ham.
What avails it?
Even if she loved, she never could be yours—
Is she not promised to Grenada's governor? Hem.
Kind heaven, let not that fell Pescara clasp
Those beauties to his bosom, and profane
An angel's form in his accurs'd embrace!
Oh no! it will not be—for she abhors him!
She shudders when she sees that man of blood,
Whom Philip sends to crush us. Well she feels
That he was once the Inquisition's satellite,
Till Philip pluck'd the cowl from off his front,
To raise him to his councils. Oh! Florinda,
Before I see thee his, may Heav'n's swift fire
Fall on my head! Hal.
Weak and degenerate passion!
How it unmans your nature! I perceive
Malec alone can break this fatal charm.
Would that the aged Moor, to whom your father
Upon his death-bed gave you, had return'd!
Too long amid the Moorish mountaineers
He lingers from Grenada. Would he were here,
To wake your slumb'ring virtue! Hem. (Going)
Fare you well! Hal.
[75]   Where wouldst thou go? 'Tis midnight's silent hour.
[Page 4]

Nightly you wander forth. No couch now strews
Repose and sleep for you; nor, till the morn,
Pale and aghast you come. Hem.
This is my hour,
My only hour of joy. Haly, I go
To stand beside her lattice—there, sometimes,
I hear her distant voice, when up to heav'n
It goes in midnight melody. The moon
Throws, sometimes, on her face, its tender beams;
And e'en when I no longer can behold her,
I see the light that from the casement shines,
And gaze upon it, as it were the star
Of lovers, till the morning. Hark! Hal.
A sound
Of far-off tumult murmurs on mine ear,
Like ocean's chafing surge— Ham.
Behold, the sky
Doth redden in the black horizon's verge;
A strong unnatural light streams o'er the dark,
And mocks the dawn of morn.                                          (Fire-Bell heard.) Enter a Moor. Moor.
My lord, the palace
Of Count Alvarez stands enwrapped in fire! Hem.
Florinda? Speak! Moor.
She has not yet been seen. Hem.
[100]   Oh heavens, Florinda!                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 5]
SCENE II. A Street in Grenada. Enter Alvarez, supported by two Servants. Alv.
Where is my child? where is my child, Florinda?
Where do you drag me? Let me go!—unhand me!
Let me go back and die! Unnatural men,
You should not force the father from the child. 1st Serv.
The thought is phrensy!—from the rolling smoke
You scarce were ta'en alive; and here we lead you
To breathe the fresh'ning air—You shall not go,
For, should you pass the flaming gates again,
They would swallow you for ever. Alv.
Oh, my daughter! Enter a Spaniard.
Speak—tell me—speak! Span.
Your daughter has appear'd
Amid the flames at last, and at her casement
Stands with her face and arms to heaven uplifted,
And seems a suff'ring angel—while below
The multitude in speechless horror stand. Alv. (Kneeling.)
Hear, and record my oath! He that shall bear
Florinda to my arms shall win her hand,
And be inheritor of all my treasures;
[Page 6]

And, if I break that oath, the heaviest curse
Fall on my head! (A loud shout is heard.)
What is it that I hear? (Enter a Spaniard—after a short pause) Span.
My lord, a desp'rate man with furious force
Bursts thro' the gather'd thousands, scales the walls,
[25]   And plunges thro' the flame. Alv.
Oh, Heav'n reward him! (Another shout.)
That sound sends life again thro' ev'ry vein,
And my heart bounds— Voices without.
She is sav'd! she is sav'd! Alv.
O heaven!
Lead me from hence, and let me see my child.                                          [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Garden adjoining the Palace of Alvarez, part of which appears already consumed and blackened. Enter Hemeya, bearing Florinda in his arms. Hem.
I feel thy pressure in my heart—I have thee—
I clasp thee here, while all my senses rush
In the full throb of rapture—all my being
[Page 7]

Seems gather'd in the pulse that beats to thee—
I am belov'd—I am belov'd! Flor.
Hemeya!
Heaven, let me thank thee, that this generous man
Has saved me! I will look on thee, Hemeya!—
My eyes will tell thee,—I am very faint—
I cannot speak,—but I am grateful to thee. Hem.
Florinda! my belov'd!
Oh, pardon me,
If, for one moment of delirious joy,
I held thee to my heart; but here, behold,
A slave before thy feet—all that I ask
Is to gaze long upon thee, till my soul
Forgets all earthly sorrow—Oh, Florinda!
What sleepless nights, what days of desperation,
Since first thy form came on my raptur'd sight
And rested in my heart!
I did not know you lov'd me. Flor.
I confess
That I am grateful to thee. Hem.
Do not talk
[25]   Of chilling gratitude; in the dread moment
When death hung hov'ring o'er thee—I did hear—
Oh! I did hear thee say, that death itself
Was welcome here—was welcome in my arms. Flor.
Don't look upon me! for within thy gaze
I sink into the earth. Hem.
Why should Florinda,
She who is made of gentleness and pity.
[Page 8]

Deny that beam of dawning happiness,
That glimpse of op'ning heaven? Flor.
Because Florinda
Scarce to her shudd'ring heart had dared to tell
What she has told to thee—I ne'er can wed thee,
And what a pang it is to love thee still!—
Dost thou not know my father frowns upon thee?
Dost thou not know I never can be thine?
Yet, wretched that I am, I have reveal'd
What I must blush to think of.—But he comes—
My father comes—Oh! I must dry these tears;
Within his arms forget my ev'ry grief;
And feel I am a daughter.—My dear father! Enter Alvarez. Alv.
My child! Hem.
Yes, take her, clasp her to your heart,
And, as that heart beats with a father's transport,
Moor as I am, don't blame me that I love her. Alv.
[50]   By Heaven, I see thy mother in thy face!
Thou god-like man, what shall I say to thee?
Oh! let my tears fall on this noble hand,
And speak a burning soul! Hem.
I am rewarded. Alv.
Brave, generous man! Hem.
Nay, good my lord, you o'erpay
My poor desert, and grow my creditor:—
But you forget me—I am most unworthy,—
I am the Moor. Alv.
No,—I remember well,
Thou art hateful to the Christian.—Yesterday
[Page 9]

I did command Florinda, on the pain
Of heaviest imprecation, ne'er to gaze
Upon thy face again. Flor.
Oh, my dear father!
Florinda can be wretched if you please,
But not ungrateful too. Alv.
Give me thy hand:—
You love the Moor? Flor.
My lord! Alv.
Come, you confess it;
Your looks reveal your heart; and Count Pescara
Interpreted the silent tear aright,
When first I bade you wed him. Flor.
[75]                                            Let my grave,
Oh! let a couch of lead, let the cold shroud,
And the earth's grass, be all my place of rest,
Ere Count Pescara, at Heaven's awful shrine,
Claims from these lips the perjur'd oath to love
The man from whom my sinking heart recoils. Hem.
Howe'er you deal with me, let not Florinda
Be wedded to that villain!— Alv.
Hear me, Moor!
Pescara is Grenada's governor,
And bears the sway of Philip;—long he loved
And woo'd Florinda with her father's sanction.
Thou art a Moor—thy nation is a slave—
And, tho' from Moorish kings thou art descended,
The Christian spurns thee—Yet it is to thee
I give Florinda's hand. Flor.
What do I hear?
[Page 10]
Hem.
Am I in heaven?—O speak, speak, Count Alvarez,
Speak it again!—Let me be sure of it,
For I misdoubt my senses. Alv.
She is yours! Hem.
Which of you shall I kneel to? Let me press
Your rev'rend knees within my straining arms—
I shall grow wild with rapture—Men will say
The madd'ning planet smote me with its power.
[100]   Florinda, thou art mine—my wife—my joy!—
Thou exquisite perfection!—Thou fair creature!
Who now shall part us? (As he embraces her, Pescara enters.) Pes.
I! Speak, Count Alvarez,
What is it I behold?—Don't look upon me
As if you never had beheld my face.
I am Pescara—You have not to learn
What Count Pescara is.—Who ever wrong'd me
That did not perish? I had come to greet you,
And, as I pass'd, the rascal rabble talk'd
Of some wild dotard vow, some grey-beard's folly—
I seiz'd a wretch that dar'd to slander you,
And dash'd him to the earth for the vile falsehood. Alv.
If gratitude be crime— Pes.
What do I hear? Hem.
What you shall hear again. Pes.
Moor, not from thee—
I would not let thee speak a Spaniard's shame.
[Page 11]

You, madam, will inform me; you, whose eyes
Are bent upon the ground,—whose yielding form
Doth seem like sculptur'd modesty—Nay, tell me,
For I have tidings for your ear. Flor.
My lord, I do confess, my father's will
Unites me to the Moor. Pes.
And you obey him;
[125]   For here obedience is an easy virtue. Flor.
Yes—where my heart swells with the glowing sense
Of tender thrilling gratitude—my being
Owns in its deep recess the consciousness
That it is all his own—Nay, think, my lord,
Can I behold his face, and not exclaim,
“This is the man who sav'd me!” Can I feel
The pleasures of existence,—can I breathe
The morning air, or see the dying day
Sink in the western sky,—can I inhale
The rose's perfume, or behold the lights
That shine for ever in yon infinite heaven,—
Or can I taste one joy that nature gives
To this, our earthly tarrying place,—nor think
That 'tis to him I owe each little flower
I tread on in life's bleakness?
E'en now I place my hand upon my heart,
And, as it throbs, there is a voice within
That tells this throbbing heart it would be still,
Were not Hemeya brave.—This is my father,—
He gave that life Hemeya did preserve,—
And, when he gives my hand in recompense,
I cannot but obey.
[Page 12]
Pes.
I thank you, madam;—
And, since it seems that gratitude's the fashion,
[150]   Your pains shall be requited.—Know, fair maid,
The daughter of Alvarez never shall
Be wedded to a Moor—Nay, do not start—
Never! Hem.
My lord! Pes.
No!—never! Alv.
Count Pescara!
What is it that you mean? Pes.
I mean, my lord,
That others have more care of your nobility
Than you have ta'en yourself.—Ha! ha! a Moor!
One of that race that we have trodden down
From empire's height, and crush'd—a damn'd Morisco,
Accursed of the church, and by the laws
Proscrib'd and branded.—What, you choose a Moor
To swell the stream of your nobility
With his polluted blood?—In sooth, 'tis pleasant! Hem.
You have forgot me—you forget yourself.—
Thro' centuries of glory, on the heads
Of my great ancestors, the diadem
Shone thro' the world, and from each royal brow
Came down with gath'ring splendor;—and if here
It shines no more—'tis fate—But what art thou?—
The frown of Fortune could not make me base;
The smile of Fortune could not make thee noble.—
[175]   Who knows not that Pescara once, within
[Page 13]

The Inquisition's dungeons, toil'd at torture?—
There Philip found you, and his kindred soul
Own'd the soft sympathy. Pes.
My birth!—confusion—
And must I ever feel the reptile crawl,
And see it pointed at?—What if I rush,
And with a blow strike life from out his heart?—
No—no! my dagger is my last resource. (Draws a roll of parchment from his bosom.)
Here, Moor, within thy grasp I plant a serpent,
And, as it stings, think 'tis Pescara's answer—
This very night it reach'd me from Madrid,
And thou art first to hear it—Look you here—
If Caucasus were heap'd between you both,
With all his snows,—his snows have not the pow'r
To freeze your amorous passion half so soon
As Philip's will.—Farewell—but not for ever!                                          [Exit Pescara. Alv.
As Philip's will!—Rumour went late abroad
Spain's gloomy sovereign had decreed to crush
Your race to deeper servitude.—Florinda,
Be not so terrified. Flor.
Can I behold
The quick convulsive passions o'er his face,
And read his soul's deep agony, nor feel
A terror in my heart?—Tell me, Hemeya,
[200]   What heavy blow relentless Fortune strikes—
What other misery is still in store
To fall upon our heads. Hem.
A Christian!—No!—
[Page 14]
Flor.
Wilt thou not speak to me? wilt thou not chase
The dreadful fears that throng about my soul?—
Wilt thou not speak to me? Hem.
Accursed tyrant!
Florinda, wilt thou leave me?—Can my fate—
Can kings and priests—e'er pluck thee from my soul? Flor.
No! Hem.
Then, Florinda, thus I spurn the tyrant!
They'd make a Christian of me—Philip proscribes
My nation and my creed; and, on the pain
Of instant death, unless he publicly
Abjure his prophet's law, no Moor can wed
A Christian woman. Flor.
Well, dost thou renounce me? Alv.
Hear me, Hemeya!—Will you yield obedience
To Philip's will, and swear yourself a Christian? Hem.
A Christian! Alv.
Ay! it is the law. Hem.
The law!
What law can teach me to renounce my country? Alv.
Then choose between your prophet and Florinda. Hem.
[225]   Wilt thou abandom me? (To Florinda.) Alv.
Let my deep curse
Fall on her head— Flor.
Don't breathe those dreadful words—
Do I deserve that you should doubt me?—No!
[Page 15]

In infancy I gaz'd upon your face
With an instinctive reverence, that grew
To reason's tender dictate—Never yet
Have I offended you; and let me say
My tears may flow from eyes long used to weeping,—
My form may wither in the gripe of grief—
My heart may break indeed—Love can do this—
But never can it teach Florinda's hand
To draw down sorrows on a father's age,
Or to deserve his curse. Hem.
This, this from thee! Flor.
You've found the dreadful secret of my soul—
But hold—what am I doing?—Pride, where art thou?
Am I so fallen in passion?—Oh, my father,
Lead me from hence! Hem.
Florinda, stay one moment—
Don't leave me—don't abandon me. Flor.
My father,
Lead me from hence! Alv. (To Hemeya.)
You have heard Alvarez' will—
[250]   Take one day for decision—If to-morrow
You do not, in the face of Heav'n, renounce
The faith of Mahomet, renounce Florinda! Hem.
Oh misery!—My Florinda, look upon me! Flor.
Yes, I will look upon thee, and perhaps
[Page 16]

Shall never look again—for, from this hour,
You never may behold or hear me more. Hem.
Then let me die! Flor.
Hemeya, listen to me!
My heart has own'd its weakness—yet, thank Heav'n,
With all my sex's folly, still I bear
My sex's dignity—I've not the pow'r
To crush the fatal passion in my breast,
But I can bury it—Yes, yes, Hemeya,
I feel my blood is noble, and Florinda
Shall never stoop before thee—From the world
I'll fly—from thee for ever!—Tears may fall,
But none shall see the blushes where they hang!—
Thou shalt not see me weep—thou shalt not have
The cruel pleasure—In religion's cells
I'll hide my wretchedness—Farewell, Hemeya!
And, Heaven, if I may dare to lift to thee
A pray'r of earthly passion, touch his heart,
Fill it with holy light, and make him thine—
And, howsoe'er thou shalt decide my doom,
[275]   On him pour down thy blessings!— (As she goes out, she looks back for an instant.)
Oh, Hemeya!—                                          [Exit Florinda. Hemeya manet.
She blest me as she parted; yet I feel
A curse fall on my heart!—
[Page 17]

I am doom'd to choose
Between despair and crime—My fate cries out,
Be wretched or be guilty!—But, Florinda,
How could I live without thee?—Can I see
That form, to which I stretch'd my desp'rate arms
In the wild dream of passion and despair,
Brought to my bosom in assur'd reality,
Nor rush to clasp it here?—Would the faint traveller
Who long hath toil'd thro' Afric's sultry sands,
Droop o'er the fount that 'mid the desert gush'd
Even from the burning rock, and die with thirst,
While its clear freshness woo'd him to be blest?—
No! he would drink, tho' there were poison in it.                                          [Exit.

END OF ACT THE FIRST.

[Page 18]
ACT II. SCENE I. The Exterior of the Inquisition. Enter Malec and Haly. Malec.
Renounce his people! Haly, I did not think,
As here I journey'd from yon rugged cliffs,
To hear these fatal tidings.—Oh Hemeya! Haly.
After long struggles of reluctant honor,
He promis'd to abjure his nation's creed.
To-day the public rite of abjuration
Is to be solemnized. Mal.
I have heard enough. Hal.
But when you tell what you had come to teach him—
And he has heard that on his brows shall shine
The crown his fathers wore—When you have told him— Mal.
I will not tell him—Till he has deserv'd,
He shall not wear a crown. A diadem
Shall never call him back to honor's road,
If honor could not do it. But I'll try
My wonted pow'r upon him—From its ashes
'Twill not be hard to wake th'expiring flame
[Page 19]

That once burnt bright within him. Thou, meanwhile,
Call at the Cadi's house the noblest Moors,
That to their secret ears I may unfold
The cause of my return.                                          [Exit Haly. Mal.
Renounce the faith
That suff'ring had endear'd, when twenty thousand
Of his brave countrymen are leagued together,
[25]   To break the bonds of Philip's tyranny!—
When freedom's flame from yonder mountain tops
Will blaze thro' Spain's wide realm, he basely falls
Before the tyrant's edict, and obeys!—
But, hold—he comes!—There was a time, Hemeya,
When I had rush'd to catch thee in my arms.                                          [Enter Hemeya.
I charge thee not to touch my garment's edge. Hem.
Oh, Malec, this from thee! When I behold thee,
After long months of absence, dost thou scorn me? Mal.
Dost thou not scorn thyself?—I know it all;
Fame has not kept thy baseness from mine ears.
What, for a wanton—! Hem.
Wanton! Mal.
Ay, a Spanish wanton!—
Is she not one of those same melting dames,
Unlike the prophet's virgin votaries,
[Page 20]

That let men's eyes blaze on unveiled charms,
And are themselves the wooers?—'Tis for a wanton
You choose to be a villain. Hem.
I permit you
To rail against myself; heap on my head
Your heaviest curse, your blackest reprobation;
Open my heart, and stab; drive in more deep
The arrows of remorse;—but do not dare,
Tho' you're my father's friend— Mal.
[50]   What should I fear?
Away, slight boy! and speak not of thy father.
I'm glad he sleeps in unattesting marble,
Else hadst thou been a parricide. Hem.
I am guilty; I confess that I am guilty.
But if you felt what youth and passion feel,—
If those soft eyes had ever beam'd upon thee,—
If long, like me, thou'dst wither'd in despair,
Till fresh'ning Hope rose in thy desert heart,—
Oh, if, like me, thou'dst borne her in thy bosom,
While ruin flam'd above— Mal.
Forbear, fond youth! my ears are pall'd already.—
Rein in thy wanton fancy—Dost thou think
That I am made to hear a lover's follies?
Go, tell them to the moon, and howl with dogs!—
Did she possess the charms of her who sleeps
Within the prophet's bosom, I would spurn
The man who had renounc'd, for her embrace,
His country and himself. Hem.
We have no country!
[Page 21]
Mal.
Thou hast, indeed, no country. Hem.
Are we not bound to earth? The lording Spaniard
Treads on our heads—We groan beneath the yoke
That, shaken, gores more deeply!—
Resistance will but ope new founts of blood
[75]   To gush in foaming torrents—Dost thou forget
The Spaniard lifts the sword, and almost wishes
That we should give pretence to tyranny?
Look at yon gloomy towers; e'en now we stand
Within the shadows of the Inquisition. Mal.
Art thou afraid? Look at yon gloomy towers!
Has thy fair minion told thee to beware
Of damps and rheums, caught in the dungeon's vapours?
Or has she said those dainty limbs of thine
Were only made for love? Look at yon towers!—
Ay! I will look upon them, not to fear,
But deeply curse them. There ye stand aloft,
Frowning in all your black and dreary pride,
Monastic monuments of human misery,—
Houses of torment, palaces of horror!
Oft have you echoed to the lengthen'd shriek
Of midnight murder; often have you heard
The deep-choaked groan of stifled agony
Burst in its dying whisper—Curses on ye!
Curse on the tyrant that sustains you too!
Oh, may ye one day, from your tow'ring height,
Fall on the wretches that uphold your domes,
[Page 22]

And crush them in your ruins! Oh, Hemeya!
Look there, Hemeya! think how many Moors,
How many of our wretched countrymen,
[100]   Are doom'd to perish there, unless— Hem.
By Heav'ns!
Thy burning front, thy flaming eyes, proclaim it—
Some glorious thought is lab'ring—Speak—what mean'st thou?
I feel thy spirit's mastery—my soul
Fires in the glowing contact—Malec, speak!
Tell me, what can we do? Mal.
What men can do
Who groan beneath the lash of tyranny,
And feel the strength of madness.—Have we not scimitars?
'Twas not in vain I sought those rugged heights,
Nor vainly do I now again return—
Amid the Alpuxerra's cragged cliffs,
Are there not myriads of high-hearted Moors,
That only need a leader to be free?
Thy voice would be a trumpet in the mountains,
That, from their snow-crown'd tops and hollow vales,
Would echo back the blast of liberty.—
Dost thou not understand me? Hem.
Speak!—Can I free my people?—Can I rend
Our shameful bonds asunder, and revenge?— Mal.
Canst thou?— Hem.
Do not command me not to love;
But, if there be a road to liberty,
[Page 23]

Provided Death, with his uplifted dart
[125]   Stand at its entrance—speak—is there a way?— Mal.
And, were there not a way,
We'd hew one in the rock!—There is a way— Hem.
My soul hangs in thy lips— Mal.
I fear thee still—
I fear thy wav'ring nature. Hem.
No, you wrong me—
By Heav'n you wrong me!— Mal.
Fall upon the earth,
And by thy father's sacred memory—
By all thy people's wrongs—by Allah's name—
Swear— Enter Florinda. Flor. (Interrupting him.)
Hold! what is it that I see? Hem.
A wretch! Mal.
Swear! quickly swear, before a woman's art
Turn thee to that a woman's self should spurn. Flor.
What should he swear?— Mal.
For ever to renounce thee! Flor.
Ay! let him, if he will; let him renounce me.
I will not say that I am hardly us'd,
Nor load him with my love!—I can bear all,
Except to see him perish. Mal.
Swear, Hemeya,
Never to be a Christian. Flor.
Hold! for Heaven's mercy!
[Page 24]
Hem.
[150]   Bright angel, art thou come to save, or damn me? Flor.
I'm come to tell the perils that surround thee.—
Cruel, unkind, Hemeya! I perceive
The pow'r that Malec holds upon thy soul.—
But yesterday, e'en at the cloister's gates,
You cried you would renounce the world for me. Mal.
Ay! what is worth much more than all the world,
More than the crescent diadem that shines
On Selim's turban'd brow—more than the heav'n
The prophet's eye beheld—nay, more than thee—
His honour and his truth!—Rightly thou hast said
'Tis I who snatch him from thee. Flor.
Not from me—
It is from life you snatch him. Let him leave me—
Never behold me more! Hem.
Can I do that? Flor.
Do any thing but perish.
I reck not of myself; but I have heard,
Since last we parted, more than first I fear'd:
The king's decree has arm'd Pescara's hand
With pow'r omnipotent against the Moors.
Death hovers o'er thy head! Gomez, Pescara,
Are crouch'd to leap upon thee.
Hemeya, be a Christian, or you perish! Hem.
It is not hard to die—thou, thou alone
[175]   Art all that makes life worth the keeping to me. Mal.
I will not think a well-wrought tear or two
Can make thee base again.
[Page 25]
Hem.
Within thy bosom (to Malec)
I'll bury all my face; for, if I dare
To gaze upon her charms, they will unman me. Flor.
And dost thou scorn to look upon Florinda?
And am I spurn'd so far? Once, once 'twas otherwise:
Now I am fit for scorn! Hem.
Florinda! Mal.
Hold!
Weigh not your country with a woman's tears. Flor.
I am, indeed, a woman; and I feel
My sex's cruel portion, to be woo'd,
And flattered, and ador'd, until at last
We own our nature's folly;—then you spurn,
Who wept and sighed before. You then pull down
The idol that you worshipp'd, and you deem,
Because a woman loves, she should be scorn'd!
I should not weep, and you would not despise me. Hem.
Malec! Mal.
Are you a man?—are you his son
Whose heart ne'er felt a throb but for his country? Hem.
Look here, and pity me!—Behold this face,
Where shines a soul so pure, so sweet a spirit—
[200]   Can I renounce her? tell me if I can—
Look on him, my Florinda! lift those eyes,
So full of light, and purity, and love;
Look on him, and he'll pity me.
[Page 26]
Flor.
Hemeya,
Art thou so kind again, and wilt thou live? Hem.
Stay near my heart, and, as I press thee thus,
I shall no longer feel this agony:
I never can resign thee. Mal.
Worthless Moor!
Why does my poniard tremble in my grasp?
Woman! Flor.
You shall not tear him into death. Mal. (Aside.)
I cannot do it—yet, must I behold
The son of Moorish kings a woman's slave?—
I'll try to rouse him still.—Perfidious traitor! Hem.
Traitor! Mal.
Traitor! and, if there be a name more foul,
Apostate! Flor.
Spare him—spare him!—Dost thou see
How his frame trembles, and what agony
Is stamp'd upon his face?—Oh, pity him! Mal.
I do indeed—I spurn him for his weakness;—
But, woman, have a care,—leave him,—renounce him,
Or else— Flor.
[225]   I can resign Hemeya's heart,
But cannot give his life—nay, tell me, Malec,
You, who have lov'd him, watch'd his tend'rest youth,
And hold him in your heart,—would you consent
To yield him up to burning martyrdom,
[Page 27]

And cast him in the raging furnaces
That persecution lights with blasts of hell? Mal.
Better that he should perish— Flor.
Dost thou say so?
Would'st plunge him in destruction? Would'st thou see him
In all the torments of a ling'ring death,
While Gomez and Pescara stood beside,
To glut themselves upon his agonies? Mal.
Woman, thou hast employ'd thy sex's cunning,
To make my friend a villain;—but beware,—
Else I will break thy spells—I will unloose
The charmed threads thou wind'st around his soul. Flor.
I will renounce him!—You, perchance, desire,
That, from your prophet's vot'ries, he should choose
One fairer and more happy than Florinda—
Let him but speak it, and a cloister's cell
Shall be the refuge of her misery.—
I ask for nothing but Hemeya's safety,
And that's too dear to part with. Hem.
Leave me! never—                                          [Malec draws his dagger. Mal.
[250]   Then it is done—Prophet, behold the deed!
Strengthen my trembling hand—it is for freedom,
It is for Heav'n I strike!                                          (He pauses for an instant, and, after a struggle, exclaims)
[Page 28]

I cannot do it!—
I am myself a coward.                                          (He lets the dagger fall).                                          [Hemeya and Florinda start. Hem.
Abhorr'd, detested villain! Mal.
Call me coward,—
For that I feel I am;—'twas Heav'n itself
That bade me strike—and nature conquer'd me. Hem.
Curs'd be the creed that can make murder holy!—
Thee! thee! Florinda—here within my arms!—
Ha! was it here thou would'st have plunged the poniard!
Fear not, sweet trembler! shelter thee, my love!—
Harm shall ne'er reach thee here.—Avoid my sight!—
Fanatic, hence!—In him I once rever'd
I see the reeking murderer— Mal.
Do not think
The blow was destin'd for her heart alone—
If, in obedience to the prophet's law,
I had been brave enough to do the deed
That Mahomet had sanctioned, from her breast
I would have drawn the steel to plunge it here,
And, as the life flow'd forth, have told thee that
Which thou shalt never hear. I leave thee now;
For thou art sunk so deep, that 'twere in vain
[275]   To pluck thee from thy shame. I go to seek
Grenada's Moors, met for a noble purpose.
Know, thou hast lost a crown—Farewell for ever!
Hemeya! ah! Hemeya!                                          [Exit Malec.
[Page 29]
Hem.
I heed not what he says; I can but think
His cursed steel was aim'd against thy life. Flor.
And that alone could blot thine image here. Hem.
But murder trembled as it gazed upon thee;
He could not strike—thy beauty, like a charm,
Unnerv'd his grasp!—Heav'n sets its seal upon thee,
And consecrates thy form!—Oh! what bright wonders
Are gathered in thy face, when e'en the prophet
Could not compel him to the bloody deed,
And Malec's hand could shudder! Flor.
Thou then wilt ne'er
Renounce Florinda for the cruel faith
That would have pierc'd a heart that beats for thee.
That look! I'm blest,—and see, my father comes,
To be the witness of Florinda's bliss. Enter Alvarez. Alv. (To Hemeya.)
I come to seek you, for the gorgeous temple
Is kindled with the church's brightest pomp,
And thousands wait your presence, to begin
The rite of abjuration. Hem.
Is my fate
So near its hard completion?
[Page 30]
Alv.
[300]   It is well
Thou hast consented, else the fiercest fires
The Inquisition kindles for the Moors
Had been thy portion. Flor.
Then lose not an instant;
Take him, my father, else he will go back. Alv.
To-night a priest shall join your wedded hands. Hem.
And let that thought alone possess my soul:
Upon the verge of ruin I will gaze
On the bright vision that allures me on,
And leads me to the gulf—I'll turn my eyes
Tow'rds the star-studded heav'n, where still it shines
While I am sinking. Yes! when I behold thee,
Conscience is scarce a rebel to thy charms.—
I go, Florinda; but do not forget
That, if I dare be guilty, 'tis for thee!                                          [Exeunt Alvarez and Hemeya. Flor.
I am happy now—
A beam of angel-bliss falls on my heart.
And spreads Heav'n's light about it. The gates of the Inquisition open.—A bell tolls twice.
What do I see? Enter Gomez, Pescara, and Inquisitors from the interior of the edifice.
The Inquisition's servants—Gomez!—Pescara! (She rushes up wildly and exultingly to the Inquisitors.)
[Page 31]

He is a Christian!—he has 'scaped your toils,—
Heav'n watches o'er his safety—You are foil'd.
Stir not another step—Back, back again—
Back to your cells and caverns. Do you not see
[325]   Faith, like an angel, hov'ring o'er his head?—
Back, back, he is a Christian! Gom. (Advancing towards her.)
Who art thou,
That with loud adjuration hast presum'd
To interrupt the servants of the church? Pes.
Forgive her, holy father, for she seems
Touch'd with inspiring power.
(Goes up to her.) The fair Florinda!
I cry your mercy, madam. Flor.
Pardon me,
I know not what I said. Pes.
Ay, but I know it.
Stay, stay, fair maid!—
(To Gomez.) Speed, Gomez—strike the blow,—
Strike it at once.—And, hark ye, as you go,
Think that Pescara will not be ungrateful.                                          [Exeunt Gomez and Inquisitors. Flor.
He sends him forth
Upon some dreadful purpose. Pes.
Do you deign
To look upon the wretch from whom your eyes
Were ever turn'd with loathing?—But 'tis merciful.
This sun-set beam of hope,—
Nay, do not tremble;
You should not fear the man that you despise.
[Page 32]
Flor.
My lord, 'tis not my purpose to offend you:
[350]   One poor request is all that I entreat;—
Tell me, what cause has call'd these men of death
Forth from their dread abodes? Whom do they seek?
What is their dread intent?—Teach me, my lord;
I do conjure you, teach me. Pes.
Ay, 'tis your sex's vice—when curiosity
Once stings a woman's heart, Scorn will turn suppliant,
And Hate itself will almost learn to woo. Flor.
Not against him? Pes.
Who is it that you mean?
I do not understand you. Flor.
His dark eye
Glitters with horrid meaning—“Like the glass,
“Within whose orb the voice of magic calls
“The fiends from hell, within its fiery globe
“The demon passions rise!”
My lord, forgive me
That I have dar'd to ask—I take my leave. Pes. (Stopping her.)
Nay, do not go—Altho' I am forbid
To tell the secrets of the Inquisition,
Yet something can I tell you. Flor.
Well, my lord—? Pes.
'Tis but a dream. Flor.
You mock me. Pes.
Do not think it—
[Page 33]

[375]   You are a pious and believing maid,
And long within a convent's holy cells
Commun'd with Heav'n's pure votaries.—I remember
When you did marvel what young virgins meant
When all their talk was love; for, on your heart,
It fell like moonlight on a frozen fountain.—
That heart has melted since;—but you, perchance,
Have still retain'd enough of true belief
Not to despise a vision! On my couch,
Last night, I long lay sleepless—I revolv'd
The scorns, the contumelies I have suffered,
But will not brook;—at last, sleep closed my eyelids,
And then methought I saw the am'rous Moor
In all the transports of exulting passion;
And I stood by, chained to a fiery pillar,
Condemned to gaze for ever; while two fiends
Did grin and mow upon me.—
Senseless I fell with rage.—As thus I lay,
From forth the yawning earth a figure rose,
Whose stature reach'd to heaven—his robes appear'd
Woven out of solid fire—around his head
A serpent twin'd its huge gigantic folds;
And on his front, in burning characters,
Was written “Vengeance!” Flor.
Vengeance! Oh! my lord!
[Page 34]

[400]   You fright me;—but I ne'er offended you—
What crime have I committed? Pes.
Listen to me:—
He cried “Do not despair!” and bade me follow. Flor.
Let me depart— Pes.
I followed,—
He led me to a bow'r of Paradise,
And held a cup of joy, which, he exclaim'd,
Was mingled by himself—I quaff'd; 'twas nectar,
And thrilled within my heart—Then, then, Florinda!— Flor.
Let me implore you.— (Struggling.) Pes.
Then, within my arms
Methought I press'd thee. Flor.
Hold!—This violence— Pes.
Nay, do not talk of violence;
You seem'd a willing and a tender bride,
And rushed into my bosom.— Flor.
Count Pescara,
I must not hear this mockery—Do not speak
Of what you should not think—This very day
Shall bind me, with an everlasting vow,
To him!—ay, him, I do not fear to tell it,—
To him my heart adores—'Tis not to me
You should unfold your wild and horrid fancies. Pes.
Mark me!—There's oft a prophecy in dreams.                                          [Exit Pescara. Flor. (Alone)
[425]   Ha! this means something. Well I know Pescara:—
His voice doth sound like fate within my soul,
That answers back in faint and trembling echoes.
[Page 35]

This horrid band of death—his fell commands—
The terrors of his eye—his looks of destiny—
All, all affright me!—If I must be wretched,
O Heav'n! don't let me know it—leave me still
The bliss of ignorance! What if Pescara,
Before Hemeya has abjured his creed,
Should treacherously seize him?—
Would that the rite were done!                                          [A distant symphony is heard.
What seraph music floats upon my soul?
Methinks it is the organ's solemn swell,
That from the church's aisles ascends to heaven.
The holy rite proceeds—Sweet sounds, awake;
Awake again upon my raptured soul!                                          [A distant chorus sings. CHORUS.
   The mystic light
   Has dawn'd upon his sight:
He sees, and he believes. Rejoice, rejoice,
With one acclaiming voice!
Strike, seraphs! strike your harps, and, thro' the sky,
Swell the full tide of rapt'rous melody! The Curtain falls, while Florinda kneels.

[Page 36]
ACT III. SCENE I. A magnificent Apartment in the House of the Cadi of Grenada. A number of Moors are assembled together. The Cadi, Haly, Hamet, &c. Cadi.
Haly , the noblest of Grenada's Moors,
Within the sacred walls where we are wont
To celebrate the prophet's holy name,
Meet at your bidding. Hal.
You are call'd together
By the command of Malec; he returns
From the Alpuxerras, fraught with some great tiding,
And bade me summon you. Cadi.
We need his counsel
In this our hour of sorrow—When our prince
Turns recreant from his people, it is well
Malec is left us still—for his great soul,
Firm to the prophet, lifts its stubborn height,
And, by the storms of fate, more deeply still
Is rooted in his country.
[Page 37]
Ham.
See—he comes!—
But with disturbed step.— Enter Malec. Mal.
He is a Christian!
Lend me thy aid, good Hamet!—Ha! I am old—
What! do I weep? Dry—dry my tears in rage—
Do not despise me, Moors!—I am a man—
I am again a man—No more of him!—
Moors, fellow countrymen— Cadi.
Speak, thou brave man!
[25]   We wait the voice of Heav'n— Mal.
The voice of Heav'n
First waked the great design—Amid the mountains
I sought those untam'd Moors, whose fathers fled
To Nature's fortresses, and left their sons
Their freedom and their faith!—The prophet smil'd,
And gave me pow'r to light within their breasts
The fire that glow'd in mine!—Moors! if your souls
Are noble as the rugged mountaineers,
You will not brook to see your sacred rights
Robb'd by the tyrant.—Philip's law proscribes
Our creed, our rites, our sacred usages—
Plucks off our silken garments from our limbs,
And clothes us in our slav'ry. If he could,
He'd blot the burning sunbeam from our faces,
[Page 38]

And wash us into white and pallid Christians!
Would you not rather die? Moors.
We will die before it. Mal.
No, you shall live in freedom!
Know that already twenty thousand Moors
Are leagued by direst oaths—Ha! I am glad
Your hands are laid upon your scimitars—
Draw, draw them forth; and, as they blaze aloft,
Swear that you will be free! Moors.
We swear! Mal.
[50]   Then learn,
Thro' the Morisco towns a wide conspiracy
Has long been form'd to raise again on high
The standard of the prophet—The first blow
Shall be Grenada's capture!—Be prepar'd
To join your countrymen.—This very night,
Their marshall'd numbers, 'neath the auspicious moon,
Shall move upon the glorious enterprise!
And, ere the morn, the crescent shall be fix'd
High on the Alhambra's tow'rs! Moors.
We shall be free!                                          [They brandish their scimitars. Mal.
God and the prophet grant it!
Oh, Mahomet! look down from Paradise,—
Pity thy suffering people,—raise again
Amid the land, where once our fathers rul'd,
Thine empire and thy faith!—Kneel, fellow Moors,
(For 'tis the hour of pray'r); and tow'rds the east,
As low you bend, from mid the sacred shrine,
[Page 39]

Arise the hymn of holy melody,
For 'tis in Heaven we trust! ( The Moors kneel.) Chaunt.
Allah! hear thy people's pray'r,
And lift thy vot'ries from despair!
On empire's mountain-height replace
The children of a noble race!
   And set us free!
[75]   Prophet of God! restore
The conqu'ring days of yore,
   And set us free! (A step is heard without.) Cadi.
Suspend your holy rite—let your hymns cease!
Behold, a Spaniard with profaning step
Comes rushing tow'rds the shrine! Malec.
An infidel
Presumes to break on our solemnity! Enter Hemeya in precipitation, and in Spanish garments. The Moors all rise.
What do I see? Ha! does he come to blast me? Hem.
I know you wonder that I dare approach
This consecrated spot—but when you hear—
Ha! now I feel my guilt. Mal.
Speak, noble Christian!
How are we honour'd with your gracious presence? Hem.
Oh! hear my prayer— Mal.
You mean your high commands—
I am a Moor, a vile ignoble slave—
[Page 40]

You are a Christian!
These costly garments that adorn your body
Proclaim your lordly rule:—What is your pleasure?
If you would buffet me, as many a time
I've seen it done, I'll bear it patiently.
Employ the privilege of your religion,
Right worthy, true, and honourable Christian! Hem.
Your ev'ry word stings like an aspick here!
[100]   But do not think that, with remorseless soul,
I dare to come where ev'ry voiceless thing
Proclaims my guilt aloud—It is your safety
That leads me here before you—Malec, fly!—
The Inquisition— Mal.
What! the Inquisition— Hem.
Prepare to drag thee to their cells of death! Mal.
Are we betray'd? hast thou betray'd us too?
Traitor! accursed traitor! (Seizes him—after a pause.) I had forgot—
'Tis well—I had forgot—I did not tell thee— Hem.
Oh, use me as thou wilt; I will not pause
To search thy meaning—Hear me! 'twas e'en now
I met Pescara—With a face of smile
He came to greet me, and, with outstretch'd arm,
He grasp'd my hand in his; with that exclaim'd,
“Here let our discord end: thou'st gain'd Florinda:
A gen'rous mind tow'rs o'er its enmities!”—
[Page 41]

And then, in pledge of friendship, bade me seek thee.—
He bade me tell thee that the Inquisition
Had mark'd thee for their victim—I had doubted him,
And would have turn'd with scorn, but that I saw
Their bands of death move o'er Grenada's streets.
E'en now they come. Mal.
Why, let them come—I'm glad
They choose me for the torture! Let them come,
[125]   And I will brave them.—Ha! I know you well—
The knock of death is there!                                          (A loud knocking.) Hem.
He is lost for ever!                                          (The Moors draw their scimitars.) Mal.
Let your scimitars
Shrink back within their sheaths.—Put up your weapons. Moor.
They're drawn but to defend you. Mal.
Put them up!
Rumour, perchance, has reach'd their watchful ears,
And, doubtless, they are come, in hope to force
Confession from my lips;—but I will brave them.
Another, in the tort'ring wheel, might speak
What all their engines ne'er shall tear from me.—
Nay, I command you, hence!—Put up your weapons—
Resistance now were vain—they would seize us all—
They'd put a hundred of us to the torture.
Fly hence! Begone!                                          [The Moors retire.
[Page 42]
Manent Hemeya and Malec. Mal.
They burst the gates—I am prepar'd to meet them. Enter Gomez at the head of the Inquisitors. Gom.
You stand the Inquisition's prisoner!
Invet'rate infidel, by thy example
The Moors shall learn— Mal.
That I'm beyond your power. Gom.
Beyond our power? Mal.
These old and palsied limbs indeed are yours,
But my eternal spirit is my own!
Then hear! I spurn as well as curse your power,
[150]   And the vile tyrant that upholds you! Gom.
Bear witness that he utters blasphemy
Against the anointed king. Mal.
Against the king! against the anointed king!
Oh, you profane that name, when thus you call
The villain who has sham'd the diadem
On his perfidious brows—His gloomy throne
Is pall'd with black, and stain'd with martyr blood,
While Superstition, with a torch of hell,
Stands its fierce guardian! “Monks, with holy rage,
“Rule ev'ry council, prompt each barb'rous impulse,
“And light their own ferocity within him!”
[Page 43]

Such is the monarch “of your wretched Spain,”
Abhorr'd in his unhappy realm, and spurn'd
By all the world beside. Gom.
Hold! or yon roof
Will topple on our heads! You have confirm'd
The deadly guilt that you are charg'd withal,
And added heavier crime. You are accus'd
Of foul endeavour to seduce a Moor
Back to your cursed faith. Hem.
A Moor! what Moor? Gom.
Thyself! Hem.
Me! Gom.
And Grenada's governor,
[175]   The Count Pescara, at our dread tribunal
Stands his accuser. Hem.
What? Pescara? Ha!
A light from hell flares o'er my yawning ruin!
My horrors break upon me—What? Pescara! Gom.
And gave in proof that in this place of sacrilege
You would be found. Hem.
Why does the earth not burst?—
Why do I live?—Villain, abhorred villain!—
Caught in thy snares, and wrung within thy grasp:
Ingenious reptile, under friendship's shade
Who spun his toils, and from his poison'd heart
Wrought out the thread to catch me—Here I stand
Abus'd and fool'd to ruin. Mal.
Lead me hence! Hem. (To Gomez.)
'Tis false! 'tis false! there is not in the catalogue
[Page 44]

Of all hell's crimes a name to speak its falsehood!
'Twas he himself who sent me!—What avails it?
I see the mock'ry grin upon thy brow:
Well may'st thou look upon me as a fiend
Glares on the damn'd below. Gom.
With proof before our eyes, one way alone
Remains to prove him guiltless. Hem.
Say, what means?
Shew me one ray of hope. Gom.
[200]   'Tis thy example—
He must renounce his prophet! Mal.
Lead me hence! Hem.
Oh, Malec! Mal.
Well! Hem.
Say, shall the fatal blow
Fall from my innocent hand? Mal.
It will but perfect
What thou hast done already.—Well, speak on!
What wouldst thou ask?—Why dost thou stand aghast? Hem.
From rav'nous fires to save thy reverend head—
To save me from that horror— Mal. (stamps)
What! have I struck thee dumb?—Thou didst not dare,—
By Heavens! thou didst not dare to ask it of me!
Christian was on thy lip, but back again
I frighted the base word within thy heart.—
There let it rankle—there let be an adder
[Page 45]

And breed a thousand other reptiles there—
It was enough to come before my face,
Fresh from the mould of shame, just stamp'd with “Villain!”
Now get thee gone! Hem.
Must I behold thee—
And I the cursed cause? Mal.
May'st thou behold me—
Methinks there will be a joy in all my tortures,
[225]   If they can tear thee too—Ha! have I rooted thee?—
There stand for ever!                                          [Exeunt Malec and Inquisitors. Enter Pescara. Pes.
Now is he fit to gaze on,
And I am half reveng'd!—This is the time
To sink him deeper into desperation.—
Most noble Moor—Christian, I should have said!— Hem.
Ha! villain, art thou here? Pes.
The Count Pescara,
Grenada's governor—your friend—is here. Hem.
We are alone—Thou art come to give me vengeance!
Perfidious fiend!—Nay, do not look astonish'd;
This is no time for mockery. Pes.
Mockery! those alone
Who feel the poignant consciousness of shame
Should fear its chastisement—Who is compell'd
To spurn himself, will, in an idiot's eyes,
Seek the strong flashes of Malignity,
And find Scorn's fingers in an infant's hand!
[Page 46]

You need not fear it—But I cry you mercy—
Moor sounded harshly in converted ears;
But I'll repair the wrong, and call you Christian.
And sure you are one— Hem.
Ay, I am—thank Heav'n,
This sword proclaims it—Once the scimitar
Hung idly at my side, and I was forc'd
[250]   To gnash a chok'd revenge—but now I am
A Spaniard, and your peer!—Thou damned villain,
Whose baseness is but equall'd by thy guilt—
If I did not abhor, I'd pity thee! Pes.
You'd pity me!—It is a kind return
For admiration. Sure those virtues most
Command our wonder that we ne'er can reach;
And I confess I ne'er could win the top
Of wisdom thou hast gain'd!—On Afric's shore,
Were I thy pirate brethren's wretched slave,
I would not be a cursed renegade!
I would not be what thou art! Hem.
I confess
That I am fallen, since e'en a wretch like thee
Can tell it to me too—and yet, Pescara,
One thing at least I've gained—the right of vengeance,
As thou shalt sorely feel! Come on, Pescara! Pes.
I marvel at your wrath—what is my crime?
Indeed you wrong me. Hem.
Did not thy treach'rous falsehood win me here?
Didst thou not bid me fly to save my friend?
And then—
[Page 47]
Pes.
I did—but 'twas in kindness to thee—
This day I mean to celebrate your marriage.
With a most new and curious spectacle—
[275]   There shall be music too. Hem.
What dev'lish purpose
Lurks in thy words, and shews but half the fiend? Pes.
I tell thee, music—thou shalt have the groans
Of grey-hair'd Malec ringing in thine ears!—
The crackling flames in which he perishes
Shall hiss upon thee when thou art softly laid
Within the bosom of the amorous fair!—
Nay, put thy sword within its sheath again;
Grenada's governor will never stoop
Down to thy wretched level! Hem.
Stay, Pescara!
And take the recompense of cowardice! (Strikes him.) Pes.
A blow—from thee! My furious soul breaks loose,
And rushes on thee—I intended vengeance
More desperate and sweet;—but thou hast forc'd me
To shed thy life too soon. (They fight.) (Enter Florinda, who rushes between them.) Flor.
Forbear! forbear! or in Florinda's blood
Let Fury quench her fires. Pes.
Fool that I was!
[Page 48]

The sudden phrensy hurried me away—
I might have slain him, and a single blow
Had burst the complicated toils I weave.
(Aloud) A woman's bosom be thy shield!—He 'scapes
Pescara's arm to goad Pescara's vengeance.                                          [Exit. Hem.
[300]   He goes, and bears life with him—Fall to ashes,
Thou recreant hand, that did not pierce his heart!
Thou too, Florinda, hast conspir'd against me—
See what I am for thy sake! Flor.
Oh, Hemeya!
Speak as thou wilt, thou canst not take away
The tender pleasure of beholding thee.—
E'en now 'twas rumour'd that the Inquisition
Had seiz'd and borne thee to the dread tribunal.—
The sound was terrible; Fear wing'd my steps;
I flew to find thee, and I find thee safe.—
E'en as I pass'd I saw that aged Moor
Dragg'd pitiless along—and oh, Hemeya!
I own a throb of joy—of fearful joy—
Burst here as I beheld it. Hem.
Joy, Florinda! Flor.
On thee they would have cast the clodded earth,—
On thee they would have flung opprobrium's stain,—
On thee they would have trampled;—ev'ry blow
That fell on Malec's face would have been thine.
[Page 49]

And, oh! to see what thou hast scap'd—to feel,
To clasp, the certainty within my heart— Hem.
The earth was cast upon his reverend face? Flor.
It had been cast in thine. Hem.
The populace? Flor.
[325]   They would have scoff'd at thee too. Hem.
Now, perhaps,
From their infernal caverns they bring forth
The glitt'ring engines of ingenious agony—
The fires— Flor.
The fires were thine;—his groans and tortures,—
Their engines and their racks,—all, all were thine,
And I must have beheld it! Hem.
Coward! slave!
Thou traitor to thy people—with a lie
Stuck quiv'ring in thy heart!—Here, here I stand,
Fest'ring in Christian garments, with my shame,
Like an envenom'd robe, to scorch my limbs.
I dare lift up my brow, and mock the man.
Here is the place for me—here, on the earth,
Let ev'ry wretch tread on me as he passes. Flor.
This is too much for any mortal creature!
But, since I'm doom'd to more than human woe,
Give me, just Heav'n, much more than human patience!
Hemeya! dear as thou art cruel to me!
[Page 50]

I can bear all my sorrow—but to see thee
Phrensied in agony—think, ev'ry pang
That breaks within thy heart, must burst in mine. Hem.
Hark thee, Florinda! I am not so vile—
I'm not the very villain that you think me.
[350]   Now, by my natal star in yonder heav'n,
He shall not perish! Flor.
Speak—what would'st thou do? Hem.
Where are you, Moors?—It is Hemeya calls!
Where are you? I would kindle in your souls
The brave and fierce despair that rages here.—
Or, if you dread to follow me—alone
I'll save or die with him. Flor.
You shall not rush on death. Hem.
The voice of Heav'n cries out within my soul—
A pow'r invincible swells in my arm—
Nothing can stay me now!—I'll save my friend;
And—when 'tis done—I've done with living too. Flor.
Why is it that I live then? Oh, Hemeya!
Why did you save me from the kinder flames,
To make me curse the blessed light of heaven,
And call on death?—But I shall call in vain,
When they have dragg'd me shrieking to the altar,
And fell Pescara— Hem.
Ha, the cursed name,
That rakes up hell within me!—'Tis Pescara— Flor.
Yes, 'tis Pescara that will tear me too
To his accurs'd embrace.
[Page 51]
Hem.
Shew not that image
To my distracted thought. Flor.
[375]   When thou art gone,
What will become of me? Who then will hear
My phrensied shrieks for death, for help, for mercy?
Who then will hear me? Who will help me then?
Thou wilt not! No, thou wilt abandon me.—
“Oh! they will ring the marriage-bell for me,
“And, mid their frantic merriment, I'll hear
“The toll of death for thee.” Hem.
What shall I do?
Malec, can I desert thee?—And Florinda—! Flor.
Is he to be my husband? Am I to be
The victim of his execrable love? Hem.
Thy husband! Fall before the face of Heav'n,
And bid it witness, that, whate'er befalls me— Flor.
Behold me then! before the face of Heav'n—
That Heav'n that does not pity me—I swear,
If I must choose between Pescara's love
And death's eternal bed, I will prefer
Death for my horrid bridegroom.
Now then tell me,
Am I to die? for death, if thou forsake me,
Death only can preserve me. Hem.
No! this arm,
When I have done the deed, shall bear thee hence
Far from Grenada's towers. Enter Haly. Hal.
[400]   My lord, my lord!
[Page 52]
Hem.
Speak!— Hal.
Malec— Hem.
Malec! Hal.
Is condemn'd— Hem.
Condemn'd! Hal.
Already has the toll of death peal'd out
Its dreadful notice—Ere the sun descend,
In all the pomp of martyrdom he dies. Hem.
Where are the Moors? Where are my countrymen? Hal.
Before the Inquisition's gates they stand,
And say he should not perish, if their prince— Hem.
Tell them he shall not perish:—from the pile
Of blazing fires I'll tear him. Flor.
Oh, Hemeya!
I see the fate that wings thee to perdition. Hem.
Wilt thou not follow me? Flor.
Throughout the world—
I'll fasten to thy fate—I'll perish with thee—
I stand upon the brink of destiny,
And see the deep descent that gapes beneath:—
Oh! since I cannot save thee from the gulf,
From the steep verge I'll leap with thee along—
Cling to thy heart, and grasp thee with my ruin! (She throws herself into his arms—he bears her off.) The curtain falls.

END OF ACT THE THIRD.

[Page 53]
ACT IV. SCENE I. A Street. Bell tolls. Procession of the Inquisition. Malec—Gomez. Hemeya, Hamet, Haly (in disguise). Gom.
Here pause, and give his feeble frame repose,
Else, ere we gain the place of execution,
His aged limbs will sink upon the earth. Mal. (Very weak.)
Monks, have I reach'd your faggots? Gom.
Scarce ten paces
Divide thee from the bourne of earthly pain.—
If thou hast pow'r, look forth, and hence behold
The Villarambla, where ascends the pile,
Upon whose burning top thou'rt doom'd to die! Mal. (Looking towards the side of the Stage.)
Let me behold! Hem.
O Haly, look upon him! Hal.
Hold, my lord,
Or you create suspicion—All bespeaks
[Page 54]

The prosp'rous issue of our enterprise.—
I have dispos'd the bravest of the Moors
Around the pile of death. Hem.
Be it thy care
To lead him to the eastern gate,—meanwhile
I fly to bear Florinda from the spot
Of safety, where I left her—Then we mount
Our Arab steeds, and speed us to the mountains. Gom. (To Malec.)
Fear shakes your frame—you seem to gaze appall'd
On yonder glitt'ring scene, where all Grenada
Has pour'd her thousands to behold thee die. Mal.
[25]   It is a spectacle that fills my heart
With terror for mankind,—not for myself.
Unhappy country! land of monks and martyrs!
Women, and men, and children,—young and old,—
The beggar and the noble,—all are there,
To view the spectacle of human pain,
In laughing horrid merriment!—The mother
Comes with her little children, to behold—
Nay, some, perhaps, bear life within their bosoms,
Yet gaze without a shudder!—There, young maids,
Who would have shriek'd to see a spider crawl,
Are met to see their fellow-creature burn—
And this you call religion! But your faith,
Spaniards! your faith doth tell you otherwise;
For He, who taught you, taught you mercy too.
But one day Heav'n will vindicate itself.
[Page 55]

The blood of millions, that has drench'd your earth,
In a red cloud doth gather round his throne,
Charg'd with the lightnings of eternal wrath,
To burst, at last, upon your guilty heads.
Peru shall be reveng'd, and Mexico
Shall be reveng'd,—and I shall be reveng'd. Gom.
Perverse and harden'd sinner, I intended,
When here we paus'd, that thou shouldst give the Moors
Example of repentance. Mal.
[50]   Prithee, Monk,
Do not disturb me now—I am not worth it.
Grant me one poor request— Gom.
What wouldst thou ask? Mal.
Tell me, where is my friend? Gom.
I cannot tell thee. Mal.
I thought he would not have abandon'd me
In my last hour. When I am dead, perhaps,— Hem.
O Hamet! Ham.
Hold, or you will ruin all! Mal.
If there's a Spaniard here, to whom his creed
Does not forbid compassion, I entreat
That he approach, and bear a legacy
To one that still I love. Hem. (To Gomez.)
Let me approach him. Gom.
Then speed thee, for the hour of death draws on. Hem.
I cannot speak.
[Page 56]
                                         (He goes up to Malec, whose weakness prevents him from distinctly seeing him.) Mal.
Whoe'er thou art, I thank thee.
I have a friend, sir,—you, perchance, have heard it:—
He left his faith, and he abandon'd me;
E'en now, when you yourself have pity on me,
Hemeya left his friend;—and yet I charge thee
To bear him my forgiveness;—tell him, sir,
Tell him I love him still!—Wilt thou do this? Hem.
I'll tell him to revenge thee. Mal.
[75]   Hold! that voice! Hem.
Malec, no more! You wrong'd me.—Ha! he faints. Gom.
Come, let us on—Support his feebleness. Mal.
You need not lend your aid,—a passing trance
Came sudden on me,—I shall die contented. (Bell tolls—They move slowly out.) SCENE II. A Street. Enter Pescara and an Officer. Pes.
Have you dispos'd the chosen band of troops Where I commanded? Off.
In the narrow street,
That from the Villarambla eastward runs,
The bravest soldiers of the garrison
Await your orders.
[Page 57]
Pes.
It is well.                                          [Exit Officer.
(Alone) O Fortune,
Thy smile still follows me, and each event
Swells the deep rush of Fate, in whose swift tide
I'll plunge the man I loathe.—And did he think,
The Argus Hate would close his hundred eyes,
And that he could deceive me?                                          [A shout is heard, and drums beat.
Ha! that shout
Halloos me on, and seems as if my fortune
Cried “Triumph” from afar. Come forth, my sword!
Be true as fate to me.—Again!                                          [Another shout.
I come!
Rise, Spaniards, rise! like crouched tigers start;
Rush on the slaves, and revel in their blood!                                          [Exit. SCENE III. A Street. Enter Hamet and Haly, supporting Malec, and other Moors. Mal.
Give me a scimitar!—let me go back,—
Let me behold my brave heroic Moor! Hal.
Soon as he pluck'd you from the raging flames
He gave us orders to conduct you here;—
This is the way to safety.
[Page 58]
Mal.
That to glory!
Let me go back, and fight till all my life
Flows from my swelling veins!—Shall I stand here,
While he confronts the fiery face of battle?— Hal.
Your safety is our nation's common weal— Ham.
Behold, he sinks
Beneath the pow'r of torture—It is well!
Or back he would have rush'd—To th'eastern gate
Bear him with swiftest speed, while we return,
And share our prince's perils.—Come, my friends,
And plunge amid the tumult—that afar
Rolls like the mutt'ring thunder. Hal.
Hold!—he comes—
And bears no happy presage. Enter Hemeya. Hem.
All is lost!—
Fly!—all is lost!— Ham.
What means my glorious prince?— Hem.
Pescara had foreseen our enterprise:
With all his veterans he falls upon us—
[25]   And piles up heaps of carnage—Fly! away!—                                          (Drums.)
Hark—there! again!—One moment, and my friend
Is drawn within my fate—Fly—follow him—
Preserve him, Hamet!—and I charge thee, Hamet,
Watch o'er Florinda's safety—even now
To yonder gate a faithful Moor conducts her—
I will endeavour to defend this pass,
And gain some precious instants.
[Page 59]
Ham.
Shall we leave you
To perish here alone?— Hem.
Ay, let me perish—
No matter what befalls me!—Here, alone,
I'll stem the tumbling torrent. Hence—away!
See where it falls upon us—Be it thy care,
Hamet, to save Florinda and my friend!                                          [Exeunt Moors.
Thou evil genius of my natal hour,
Thou dark presiding spirit of my fortunes,
Who mad'st me slave—then traitor—and at last
Hast made me wretch!—here, here I bare my bosom:
Try if in all thy quiver there be left
Another shaft to pierce it. Ha! he comes!—
Well, hast thou gorged thyself with blood enough?
Art satisfied with murder? Enter Pescara. Pes.
Yield thee, slave!
Yield, traitor and apostate! traitor Christian—
[50]   Apostate Moor!—Thy coward countrymen
Are scatter'd and dispers'd—and not a hope
Is left thee now. Hem.
Thou liest! there is hope
To shed thy heart's black venom ere I fall.                                          [They fight. Enter Spanish Soldiers, who rush upon Hemeya. Pes.
Alive!—seize him alive!—
[Page 60]

My foe! the man I hate! and in my grasp!—
I have thee!— Hem.
Ay! thou seest me here before thee,
Surrounded by thy blood-hounds. Yet, Pescara,
E'en here, encompass'd by thy pow'r, Pescara,
I can defy thee still. Pes.
Defy me! dost thou? Enter Spaniard. Span.
My lord, the daughter of the Count Alvarez,
With Malec, borne on steeds of Arab race,
Fly thro' the eastern gate. Pes.
Perdition! Hem.
Destiny,
Art thou not powerless now? and thou, Pescara,
Speak! may I not defy thee? Well mayst thou stand
As if the lightning rived thee. Now, Pescara,
I brave—I tread upon thee. Pes.
Fury! despair!
Love, rage, and madness, seize upon my heart!
Fight for your prey, and rend it.—Now, Revenge!
[75]   Revenge, where art thou? Hast thou held thy cup
High to my burning lip to mock my thirst;
Then, as I clutched, to dash it from my grasp?—
Traitors and slaves! gone, fled! Are all my hopes
Thus wither'd in an instant—tumbled down—
Hurl'd headlong from the height to which I toil'd!
[Page 61]

Do you stand here to gape upon my tortures,
And blast me with his sight?—Away with him!
Hence!—let me not behold him!—to the rack!
That joy is left me still! Hem.
Bind me upon your beds of burning pain
Here on my limbs waste all your arts of agony,
And try some new experiment in torture—
Yet, even then, the pangs that rend my body
Will be heav'n's bliss to torment such as thine—
Guilt's poison'd shaft shall quiver in thy heart!
And in Remorse's fires thy scorpion soul
Shall writhe and sting itself! Pes.
Hence! from my sight!
This instant let him die! Hem.
And may'st thou live,
With thy eternal hell within thee, live,
And, to be fully damned, be immortal!                                          [Exit Hemeya, guarded. Enter Gomez. Gom.
My lord, I give you joy. Pes.
No, give me all the torments
[100]   That teem within thy brain—Am I not foil'd—
Dash'd from my purpose—thrown upon the ground?
When I had hover'd long, and pounc'd upon her,
She 'scapes me—she is gone! Gom.
She is o'ertaken:
The Moor has 'scap'd—but she is your's again. Pes.
Mine!—in my clutch!—within my hate again!
[Page 62]

Mine! Vengeance! all thy joys have burst within me,
And detestation triumphs in my soul—
Mine!—Mine again! My friend, let me embrace thee.
What hoa! who waits there? Ha! methinks I have her
Clasp'd in my arms already!—on the wheel
Methinks I see him heave!—What hoa! who waits there?
My star shall never set—Mine! mine again! Enter Spaniard.
To that fam'd chamber in the Alhambra palace,
Where Moorish kings were wont to be confin'd,
Conduct the traitor. Mine, indeed, again!
Gomez, she shall be mine!—
                                         You shall behold
Pescara's master-piece. Gom.
You would not spare him? Pes.
Spare him!—But hold, she comes to meet my purpose—
Let us retire, and unobserved, I'll tell thee
The thought that labours here— Enter Florinda. Flor.
Will none in pity teach me if he lives,
[125]   And pluck the frantic agonies of hope
From out my tortur'd heart?
                                         Ha! here is one                                          [Gomez approaches her.
That Death has sent to tell me—
[Page 63]
Gomez.
What wouldst thou learn? Flor.
No! I would still hope on—
Don't tell me—Even now I would have given
The world to hear he liv'd—but do not speak,
Lest thou should'st tell me that he breathes no more!
The sound would blast me! Gom.
He has pass'd the bounds
That limit earthly pardon— Flor.
He is dead! Gom.
'Twere too much mercy
That he had perish'd in his impious deed—
Do not deceive yourself—
With its short glimmer hope deludes the heart,
Plays for a moment on the clouds of fate,
And leaves behind a blacker desolation.—
No mortal arm can aid him! Flor.
Then you kill'd him—
You kill'd him in your dungeons—
You plung'd your cruel hands within his breast. Gom.
Let not your fears thus hurry you away—
By Count Pescara's order he was led
[150]   To the Alhambra palace—but I deem
That in the Inquisition's deepest cells
Reserv'd for ev'ry torment— Flor.
Does he live?— Pes. (From a distant part of the Stage.)
He lives, and shall not die! Flor.
Thrice-blessed sound!
[Page 64]

Hope, thou art here!—and never mother yet
Hugg'd her dear child with half the tenderness
I feel thee here, and clasp thee to my heart—
He shall not die! Pes. (Who gradually advances towards her, after dismissing Gomez.)
He shall not! Flor.
Let me see thee—
Let me behold the man who bids me hope—
And, tho' thy words be false, still speak them o'er,
And say he shall not die! (suddenly recognises him.)
Pescara! Pes.
Yes!
Don't gaze upon me with misdoubting fears—
I know you marvel that Pescara's breast
Should own a single touch of pity's weakness;—
But you mistake me—Nature did me wrong,
When on my face she laid her ruder hand,
And seem'd to make me pitiless—My heart
Is rich in tenderness—the Moor shall live—
I pardon him! Flor.
[175]   Heav'ns! is it possible?
Or has grief wrought upon my tortur'd brain
Until it grew to wild delirious joy,
And madness made me blest?—It is indeed!
It is Pescara! Oh, my lord! once more
Tell me that he shall live— Pes.
He shall! Flor.
Let me embrace your feet—here let me fall,
And drop in helpless clinging gratitude!
[Page 65]

Oh! let me look upon you—Gracious heaven!
I now no longer see the man I fear'd—
No! Mercy sheds its light about thy head!
A glory beams around thee—Oh! Pescara—
Art thou so great, so god-like, to forgive? Pes.
Hemeya shall be free! I spare my foe
To win Florinda's gratitude—to win
That look that melts me, and that smile that burns— Flor.
Once—will you not forgive me when I tell it?—
I shudder'd when I look'd upon your face,
And shrunk at your approach—I fear'd your eye—
But now you have compell'd me to esteem you,
And with the gentlest, dearest violence,
Have won my admiration! Pes.
Once you hated me. Flor.
I did not know your virtue. Pes.
[200]   'Tis in you—
'Tis in your heart I seek my recompense. Flor.
Your own heart will reward you.—When you see
The man you spar'd—when you behold his face,
And watch him as he heaves the air of heav'n,
And looks upon the sun, will you not feel
A transport in your bosom? When you wake
At midnight's hour, will you not be at peace,
And sleep again upon that blessed thought?
And, as you kneel to Heaven, may you not ask
That mercy that you gave?— Pes.
These are the gifts
[Page 66]

Of self-rewarding virtue—but, Florinda,
A traitor's life deserves a larger price.
He shall be free,
But such condition as on life I set
Must be perform'd.— Flor.
Speak what I am to do:
Command me something dire; something impossible
To any heart but woman's when she loves;—
Barefoot o'er burning deserts bid me go
On some far pilgrimage; let ev'ry limb
Be wrapp'd within the sackcloth's galling fold—
I will endure it all—and bless misfortune!—
Nay, I will fall in love with wretchedness,
[225]   If 'tis for him I bear it. Pes.
Do not think
That on your tender nature I impose
Such rude conditions.
You shall be the harbinger
Of freedom and of life—Your steps shall seek
The dungeon where he lingers, and your hand
Unbar the pond'rous bolts. Flor.
Oh! let me fly. Pes.
But first the price of freedom must be paid. Flor.
My life, if you command it!—With my life
I'll buy his dearer safety. Pes.
With yourself!—
To-night you must be mine—my wife! Flor.
Your wife!
[Page 67]
Pes.
Ay, madam! Is there thunder in the sound? Flor.
You do not mean it—No! you do not ask it—
You cannot think it. Pes.
I am resolv'd upon it.—
What mean these shudd'ring looks, these trembling hands,
These heav'n-turn'd eyes, and these wild fits of horror?
Where is the desp'rate valour which o'erthrew
Nature herself, and mock'd impossibility?
You would have giv'n your life; I ask your love. Flor.
My life, but not my love! I cannot give
[250]   What I no longer have—My wretched heart
Lies in Hemeya's dungeon. Pardon me,
But, rather than resign to other arms
A cold, reluctant, unconsenting form,
I'd fold a basilisk within my heart,
Bid its cold coil entwine my shudd'ring limbs,
And warm its icy flesh! Pes.
If you detest me as the serpent's coil,
Fear—fear me as its sting!—My lifted hand
Holds death above his head. Flor.
Upon my knees,
I call'd on Heav'n to witness— Pes.
Well? Flor.
I swore I never would be yours. Pes.
Rage, do not choke me! Flor.
I breath'd a deadly oath, that in my tomb
I would lie down for ever—
[Page 68]
Pes.
Do you dare—?
But hold! I must dissemble—Do not weep,
Or if you do, like dew on morning roses
Your tears must dry in the warm light of love. (Attempts to embrace her.) Flor.
Forbear, my lord!—I am a wretch indeed;—
But, while my sorrows cast me at your feet—
Fall'n as I am to be your suppliant—
Learn that you have not yet the rights of insult. Pes.
[275]   Curse on her pride!—Forgive me, fair Florinda,
If, thro' the blushing fence of modesty,
With hasty hand I dar'd to pluck its flowers.
The husband— Flor.
Husband! Pes.
Speak! will you be mine?— Flor.
Never! Pes.
Damnation! when the bow is bent,
And to the head the winged arrow's drawn,
The string slips off—Florinda! Flor.
Well, my lord! Pes.
Will you be mine? Flor.
You fright me—you appal my ev'ry sense! Pes.
I have too long endur'd it. Gomez, hoa! Enter Gomez. Gom.
My lord, I wait your pleasure. Pes.
You shall feel (to Florinda)
What 'tis to wake the furies in my heart—
Hoa! Gomez, art thou there?—Drag, drag him forth!
[Page 69]

Begone, I'll follow thee! Flor.
Oh! monstrous! horrible! Pes.
I say, begone! Flor. (Rushing up to Gomez.)
Stay! in the name of Heav'n, whose priest you are,
Do not profane your office—do not stain
Your sacred robe with blood. Stay, holy father!
Go not on hell's curs'd errand. Pes.
[300]   Thou shalt see him
In madd'ning agony—thou shalt behold him,
And vainly think thou couldst have sav'd him too— Flor.
How?—Save him!—Can I save him?                                          (Wildly.) Pes.
Be my wife. Flor.
Your wife! Oh! no! it is too horrible! Pes.
I'll hunt for life in every trembling limb,
And chase it down. The diving steel shall plunge—
Nay, do not stop your ears—for his shrill screams
Shall pierce the solid deafness of the tomb! Flor.
They're in my brain already!—Oh, Hemeya!
Let me not hear thy cries. Let, let me fly,
And 'scape from it.—Oh, for some depth of earth,
Where I may plunge to hear that scream no more! (Pescara seizes her as she attempts to fly.)
Unhand me! let me fly!—'Tis in my heart,
My eyes, my brain— Pes.
Look there—look there!—He dies!—see where he dies!—
The wheel goes round—See, the red froth of blood!—
[Page 70]

His hair stands up, and drips with agony!
On thee—on thee he calls—and bids thee save him!—
Look there!— Flor.
Spare, spare him! Villains! murderers!
Oh! spare him!—
Hemeya!—Lo, they wrench his heart away!
They drink his gushing blood!—Oh, God! Oh, God! (She falls into Pescara's arms.)

END OF ACT THE FOURTH.

[Page 71]
ACT V. SCENE I. Grenada stands in moonlight at some distance. Mosques and Palaces are seen in the perspective. Enter Malec and Haly, at the head of the Moors. (The moon appears in a crescent.) Mal.
Behold Grenada, Moors! Hal.
When the sun sunk
From yon high cliffs we scarce beheld its tow'rs
Set in the bright horizon's golden round.
Now, ere the auspicious night has pass'd its noon,
We stand before the city of our fathers. Mal.
Hemeya's life has wing'd your rapid march,
And, tho' the drops of labour dew'd your brows,
You triumph in the toil.—Behold Grenada!
There stand the tow'rs our fathers rais'd to heav'n,
To be the residence of Moorish kings.
Those silver spires, those magic palaces,—
The work of Arab art, the Alhambra's dome,
Are now the tenements of infidels;
And 'tis not fitting, Moors—
[Page 72]
Enter Hamet.
Well, faithful Hamet,
Have you secur'd the sentinels? Ham.
We have—
And from their lips have learnt
That in the Alhambra's prison lies our prince. Mal.
There then we speed, to burst its pond'rous gates,
And lead him forth to glory!—Not in vain
Pescara chose that dungeon, for its walls
Hold hidden murder in their hollow womb! Ham.
[25]   They tell, besides, that thro' Grenada's streets
There hath been joyaunce and wild revelry.
The garrison lie slumb'ring in debauch,
And will but wake to perish. Mal.
Let the scimitar
Be undefil'd by blood of innocence.
Come on!—'tis Heav'n conducts us—See, my friends,
In the pure azure, where the crescent shines,
And seems our glorious standard!—Let us on;
And, as we go, let ev'ry patriot breast
Be fill'd with trust, to see the diadem
Shine on your prince's brow!—I long to clasp him,
To rush into his prison, burst his chains,
And from a dungeon lead him to a throne!                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 73]
SCENE II. A Dungeon, of Saracenic Architecture. Hemeya discovered. Hem.
'Tis hush'd!—a deep repose succeeds the murmur
Of their loud exultation, and my dungeon
Is still again:—it imitates the grave.
They triumph o'er my fate—and have, perchance,
Reserv'd me for to-morrow's spectacle.
It is for this I still am let to live!
Yet, they may be deceiv'd—for now, I deem,
The hour is almost come which Malec mark'd
To fall upon Grenada. Hope, thou flatterer,
I cannot trust the voice that whispers me
She still may be mine own! What sound was there?
Or death or safety comes!—What heav'nly form
Glides like a beauteous spirit on the night?
Still, still it comes upon me! Enter Florinda, in bridal garments, and with a wreath of flowers on her head.
It is herself!
It is!—it is Florinda! Flor.
Oh! Hemeya!                                          [Falls fainting into his arms.
[Page 74]
Hem.
My eyes behold thee, and my arms embrace thee!
I have thee here—here on this throbbing breast,
The resting-place of love! Droop not, sweet flow'r!—
Oh, smile upon me!—tell me—ev'ry sense
Be charm'd at once. Say, by what wondrous ways
Thou'rt here before me—Yet, I know it all—
Malec victorious comes. The Moors arise—
[25]   They burst their bonds!—and thou art mine for ever! Flor.
I pr'ythee do not speak!—thy words disturb me. Hem.
Thy looks but ill befit an hour so blest. Flor.
Thou'rt sav'd! 'tis all that's left of happiness—
I am not quite accurs'd. Hem.
Accurs'd! Florinda? Flor.
One moment, as I gaz'd upon thy face,
I felt a throb of joy within my bosom,
Such as I us'd to feel when I beheld thee.
The slumb'ring serpent wakes, it winds around,
And here it stings!—Ah! how it stings me here Hem.
Why, how is this? joy has no tears like these. Flor.
The gate stands stretch'd upon its hinge—I will—
Yes, I will look my last— (after a long pause) Now, go for ever! Hem.
Thy words are full of madness or despair. Flor.
Oh, question me no further, but begone!
[Page 75]
Hem.
By heav'n and earth, no pow'r shall tear me hence,
Till thou hast satisfied the fearful thought
That rushes on my soul! Thou'rt here alone—
Why art thou here alone?—Where, where is Malec? Flor. (Wildly)
Malec! Hem.
Distract me not—I saw thee turn away
Far from Grenada's gates. Shrink not, but hear me!
This night—this very hour, the Moors decreed
To seize Grenada! Flor.
[50]   Moors! Grenada! Hem.
Yes!—
This very night the Moors had form'd a project
To fall upon Grenada. Flor.
Gracious Heav'n!
Oh God! what have I done? Was it this night?
This cursed night of death, despair, and horror!
Was there another way to save thee from him?—
O God! what have I done? Hem.
Ah! frantic thought!
It grapples at my heart!—thy sight doth blast me!
This bridal robe!—these flow'rs—they're full or adders! Flor.
And are they here—to mock my wretchedness?—
Off! Off, I say! you should not blow for me!
Did not a blight fall on you as you grew
Around this cursed front? Off! Off, I say!
And in your place let hemlock blacken here!
[Page 76]

And from the yawning church-yard let them weave
A ranc'rous garland—Let the roots of death
Bloom on this blasted front!
Ah! ah! Hemeya!
Hadst thou but told me, ere this wretched moment,
That Malec could have saved thee—thou wouldst ne'er
Behold a victim clad for sacrifice
Shudd'ring before thy sight, and thinking death
[75]   The only mercy left.—Then I had been—
I had been still thine own—But now, oh God!
I do not dare to tell thee what I am. Hem.
Let me embrace thee once ere thou hast said
What will call down my curse, and make me fling thee
Like a detested creature from my heart! Flor.
Hold! for thy touch is guilt—Unloose me!—spare me!—
I am— Hem.
What art thou? Flor.
I am Pescara's wife! Hem.
Thou art a woman!—that's another name
For falsehood, treason, perjury, and hell! Flor.
If I have wrongs to Heaven, I've none to thee. Hem.
Where is thy oath to die?—thine oath, Florinda!
[Page 77]

Where is thy oath that an eternal grave
Should be thy bed? Flor.
I have kept it—'twas thy life
That dragg'd me to the shrine—to save that life—
To pluck thee from the rack. Hem.
No—'twas to bind me
Down on a bed of fire!—Ten thousand deaths
Were better than to see thee what thou art!
E'en from Pescara's arms— Flor.
No—at the shrine
I claim'd aloud his promise—I was desperate;
[100]   And tho' he stamp'd, and in his mouth a curse
Froth'd in its gnashing fury, from the altar
I rush'd into thy dungeon. Oh, Hemeya!
I came to give thee freedom.—Go, Hemeya,
And leave me here to die! Oh! prize that life,—
I charge thee, prize it well,—for which I paid
So large a price.—Keep! keep it as a pledge
Of broken-hearted love! and, ere thou goest,
Hear my last words—for, wedded as I am,
Death will excuse the passion of my soul.—
Since first I saw, I loved thee;—ev'ry day
But added to the fire thine eyes had kindled:—
And now, e'en now, thou art more dear than ever!
There may be those as wretched as myself,
But none e'er lov'd so tenderly—Pescara! (Pescara, who has gradually advanced during the last speech, rushes between them.) Pes.
Have I no other name?
It is your husband!
[Page 78]
Hem.
Villain! Flor.
Do not speak to him—
Thou art still within his power. Pes.
I sent thee here
To liberate a traitor—Opportunity
Should not have been abus'd.—Why is he here? Flor.
He shall depart—Oh, hold! (To Hemeya.) He shall depart. Pes.
He shall—and never shall return. Hem.
[125]   Pescara,
This blackest plot of hell was worthy thee!
Worthy the Inquisition, where thy soul
Was early fram'd to guilt. Pes. (Stamping.)
Behold my answer! A Cell opens in the wall, and Executioners appear in it.
Now let me look upon you!—This is well—
Thou art the man I hate—I woo'd this woman,
And I was scorn'd for thee—If without love
I lov'd, I didn't hate without revenge!—
Thou'st told me I was tutor'd in the cells
Of the Inquisition—Thou'rt in the right,
And I will prove that I have studied well
The science of infliction! Hem.
Dost thou think
Thy tortures fright me, then? Pes.
I do not think it—
Here is my victim! Flor.
Do you hear this, ye heavens? Pes.
And do you hear me—
E'en now the priest scarce breath'd the marriage vow,
[Page 79]

And passion fiercely burn'd—yet, even then,
You dar'd me with his name—You call'd aloud,
And bade me free him—Love then died at once,
And hate reign'd here alone!—I sent thee here—
I follow'd thee—I saw thee in his bosom—
[150]   Now hear—he dies! Flor.
Oh Heav'n! Pes.
He dies before thy face. Flor.
No, 'tis impossible—
'Tis but to try, 'tis but to terrify me;
You do not mean the horrid deed you speak—
You are a man—you are a human creature—
O no! thou wilt not—Have I not perform'd
Each dread condition? Did I not appear
Shudd'ring before the altar?—didst thou not promise,
Didst thou not swear? Am—am I not your wife. Pes.
You are, and love my foe—Come forth, and seize him! (The Executioners advance.) Hem.
And send me quickly from this cursed world,
Where guilt, like his, can triumph. Flor.
Mercy! Pes.
Mercy! Flor.
Then, Heav'n, where are thy lightnings? Pes.
In my grasp.
Drag, drag him to your tortures! Flor.
Hold, tormentors!
And kill, oh, kill me first—here, in my heart,
Quench your fell thirst for blood.
[Page 80]
(Pescara drags her from them.) Flor.
Oh! let me not behold it—Death, do thy work—
Thou art too slow within my raging breast!
Fall, mountains, down, and hide me from this horror!
[175]   Burst, earth, and swallow me! Almighty Heav'n,
Stretch forth thy arm, and save him! Ha! they drag him,
They bear him to their torments!—Why, O Heav'n!
Why am I thus abandon'd? Voices. (Without.)
“The Moors!”                                          [Florinda listens for a moment, and a shout is heard. She shrieks, and rushes towards the front of the Stage, and falls on her knees—Pescara stands appalled—The Alarm-Bell rings. Hem.
That sound has rais'd me to the sun; my soul
Mounts into triumph! Well, infernal villain,
Well, may'st thou stand amaz'd—thy hour is come!
Thou art enclos'd in thy own den of blood. Pes.
Traitors and slaves!—Ha! that thought.                                          [He clenches his dagger. (Hemeya struggles with the Executioners.)
This,—this is left me still!—Within my grasp
I clutch it like a fierce and desp'rate joy,
Look here! look here, vile Moor!—Despite of fate
I still shall triumph o'er thee.
[Page 81]
[Pescara advances to stab Florinda. As he lifts the dagger, Hemeya, who has broken from his Executioners, rushes up, tears it from his hand, and stabs him.—The Moors rush in with Malec at their head, while Florinda sinks into the arms of Hemeya. Pescara, after a vain attempt to speak, falls dead.] Mal.
Hail, glorious Moor! Hem.
My friend! my brave deliverer! Mal.
The Moors are up in arms—The Alpuxerras
Have pour'd their marshall'd thousands to the field:
The crescent floats upon Grenada's tower,
And morning shall behold thee on the throne.
Kneel, Moors! behold your king! Hem.
Arise, my friends! Florinda, fate has pour'd
A thousand blessings in one rapt'rous hour—
But, in the thick'ning splendours of my stars,
Thou art my loveliest light. Flor.
[200]   If it be possible,
Thou, who dost weigh our mis'ries with our crimes,
Oh, take from death this agony! Hemeya,
While 'twas for thee I trembled, pain grew dull,
And lost its pow'r upon me—Now, 'tis here! Hem.
Florinda! Flor.
Yes, I have kept my promise to thee:
This is its dread fulfilment!—You were wrong
To chide me for my falsehood—Ere my marriage,
I pour'd a deadly draught within my veins,
[Page 82]

That first was ice; but now in streams of fire
Comes rushing thro' my bosom! Hem.
Give me a sword!
Give me some means of death!—Bring, bring me poison!
Or tear me to the rack from which I 'scaped!
Here, here, in mercy plunge your steels together!
Ha! what is't I see? I thank thee, Fortune!
Thou hast struck the wound, but thou canst heal it too. [He perceives Pescara's dagger on the ground, and stabs himself. Florinda shrieks, and falls on her knees beside him.] Mal.
Thou shouldst have liv'd!—thy life was still thy country's!
And, but for that, I'd follow thee. Hem.
Florinda,
Fate cannot take the joy to look upon thee,
To die beholding thee!— (Dies.)                                          [Florinda continues insensible. Mal.
In the next battle
I'll find the way to join thee. Ha! Hemeya!
[225]   Is this the palace of thy monarchy?
Is this thy throne? And is this silent corse
All that remains of him that once I lov'd? [While Malec is speaking, Florinda staunches the blood of Hemeya with her hair.] Flor.
It still will flow—But I'll stay here for ever!
[Page 83]

I'll look on these cold lips—My shiv'ring hand
Shall press this dewy forehead!—and I'll staunch
This blood, that still flows on. Mal.
Remove the body—Poor distracted wretch,
I pity thee!—Uplift that bleeding corse,
And bear it from the dungeon. Flor.
No, you shall not—
You shall not tear me hence—No!—never! never!
He is my lord!—my husband!—Death!—'twas death!—
Death married us together!—Here I will dig
A bridal bed, and we'll lie there for ever!
I will not go!—Ha! you may pluck my heart out,
But I will never go.—Help!—help!—Hemeya!
They drag me to Pescara's cursed bed,—
They rend the chains of fire that bind me to thee!
Help!—help!— (She dies.) Back matter

Main text ACT I. SCENE I. The wildest Alpine scenery of ice-mountains and precipices covered with snow, in the environs of the Great St. Bernard. The travellers are seen on different heights amid the windings of the rock, slowly descending the pass leading to the Vallais. First, Francis with two Guides exploring the way, and sounding the hollows with long poles: then Agnes by herself, preceding a litter borne by the mountain-peasants: on either side of the litter a female Attendant, followed by a Page. Agnes. Agnes.
Oh glorious Sun! illumin'd by thy beams
These wastes of snow, these Alpine solitudes
Have pow'r to sooth me. [advancing, and looking on different parts.]
                                         How distinct each rock,
Smooth-brow'd, or spiring high its tapering peak!
Yon range of wavy sweep, and this that breaks
Eastward in varied forms like floating clouds!
Their hues, how changeful! these, of roseate glow,
[Page 230]

Those, azure-dy'd: and some that climb the sky
Fling to the light their summits cop'd with gold!
Oh thou, who spak'st creation into birth,
How glorious, Lord of Nature, these thy works:
How awfully sublime! Fran.
                                         Each step we tread
Leads to new dangers. Guide.
                                         Sound that snow-heap'd cave. Fran.
How fearfully yon tumbling rock o'erhangs                                          [Turning back to Agnes.
The narrow pass. Beware! Agnes.
                                         Proceed, good Francis. Fran.
Here yawns a chasm, down whose depth, the sight
Wanders without repose. I'll gaze no more:
Its very horror, while it shocks the sense,
Most strangely fascinates.                                          [He advances.
                                         These slippery fragments,
[25]   Hurl'd by the tempest from the crags above,
Roll loose beneath me.—Lady, let me aid you:
Lean on this faithful arm. Agnes.
                                         My foot treads firm.
To those who know not grief such ways are painful.
I have within my soul what mocks at toil. Fran.
You were in luxury nurs'd, nor have been us'd
To scenes like these: I, in my childhood, rock'd
In want's stern cradle feel these aged sinews,
That never shrunk in war, ache with each step
As slow I labour on. Oh, honour'd lady!
The holy brothers of St. Bernard warn'd you
[Page 231]

Not to attempt the pass. Return, I pray.
Yet, yet amid the rocks a lingering echo
Heaves back the slow clang of the convent bell.
It is for you I fear. Agnes.
                                         My will is fix'd.
Go with the guides, and timely warning give
If aught impede the way. The topmost snow
Stirr'd by the zephyr's breath, may swell before it
To size impassable. Fran.
                                         I must obey. Agnes. [to those who bear the litter.]
Be careful, I beseech you; this steep path
Betrays th'unsteady foot: guard well the litter:
You shall not lack reward. Kind, gentle maids,
[50]   Be watchful of your charge. I first, myself,
Will this sharp ridge explore. So may'st thou, Ellen,
Securely pass, and ere death end thy woe
Find peace once more! Fran. [to the guides.]
Heard you that sound? Guide.
                                         Most plainly—
The voice of men advancing. Fran.
                                         List! again
Up as the gale comes slowly from beneath,
I hear distinct the noise of echo'd steps. Guide.
'Tis strange in this new season; so far well, Claude enters.
The rocks below are open.—Welcome, Claude:
It is the provost's guide. Thrice welcome Claude:
How fares the reverend Albert?
[Page 232]
Claude.
                                         Heav'n has heard
The convent pray'rs: he looks restor'd to youth:
Another man! 'Twill cheer your heart to see him.
He will be here in th'instant.—Hark, they come.
I haste to warn the convent. Fare you well. Guide.
Oh happy hour! Heav'n guard his sacred life. Claude. [going, speaks to Agnes.]
Lady! I pray you let the litter rest:
And in this cave, that fronts the mid-day sun,
Wait till the train pass by. This narrow ridge
Will else your lives endanger.                                          [Claude goes. Agnes. [to her train.]
Repose awhile, my friends! and in this cave
[75]   Set down the litter. Your good Provost comes—
Not these bleak rocks alone, and the Alpine swains
Echo his praises: far and wide his virtues
Call forth the general blessing on his head. The Provost and his train enter: as the Provost passes, Agnes speaks.
Your benediction, father! Pro.
                                         Peace be with you!
Those widow's weeds, this melancholy train:—
Daughter, you seem in woe, and pale your cheek
Thro' sorrow more than years: what urgent cause
Compells you to these mountains? Agnes.
                                         Holy father!
I pray you pardon me, nor deem me one
Rude or untouch'd by kindness, that I leave you,
[Page 233]

My tale of grief untold.—These sable weeds
But ill express the anguish of my soul.
But seek not out the cause. The pow'r who tries
The mourner, smites in mercy. Thou hast blest me:
Farewell— Pro.
                                         Yet, mark me, daughter, no vain wish
To hear what may in utterance grieve thy spirit,
And ill may suit my years: but sacred duties
By heav'n enjoin'd, and sympathy of nature
That bids an old man, vers'd himself in woe,
Feel for the grief of others, prompt my speech.— Agnes.
When thou dost pray for those who grieve on earth,
[100]   Remember me. Pro.
                                         Yet there are lenient words,
Balm of the soul. Daughter, my way of life
Has been where sinners wept, where sorrow sigh'd,
And anguish groan'd around me: and I know
How willingly the mourner, bow'd with woe,
Broods o'er the secret pang that life consumes.
This must not be: heav'n link'd us heart to heart
To heighten every pleasure, and by sharing
Lessen the load of misery.—Silent still?
Turn not away regardless. Agnes.
                                         No, good father;
Each word thou speak'st is treasur'd in my soul.
Would I might freely at thy feet pour forth
What weighs upon my heart. I am not one
Infirm of mind who fondly broods o'er woe.
These tears, that will not be supprest, gush out
Not for myself alone. One farewell pray'r.
[Page 234]

Trust me, the burden of my grief is lighten'd:
For thou hast pitied me. Pro.
                                         In silence mourn,
I will not urge thee more. Heav'n sooth thy soul!
But I conjure thee, if thou value life
Turn to our hospitable roof again:
There wait till fitter season may ensure
[125]   Thy safe departure. Duty forc'd my step
Now in this hazardous time: not far the roof
That shelters me: but long thy way, and perils
No arm of man can ward, surround the path
Where-ere thou goest. And these lone rocks at times
Are crost by ruthless robbers. Agnes.
                                         I must on. Pro.
No roof, no shelter near, nor safe return,
If the dim night-fall steal on thee unwares.
And oft the sun in these unsteady skies
Sinks, ere its close, in tempest. Agnes.
                                         I must on.
[Pointing to the litter.] Here lies a hapless woman, one who wastes
Hourly away, worn out with ceaseless woe:
An uncomplaining sufferer, nigh to death:
A native of yon vale; her only wish
Is yet once more to view the peaceful spot
To childhood dear, and there to find her grave
Amid her kin. Farewell. Pro.
May heav'n protect thee! [Exeunt omnes.
[Page 235]
Scene the second the Convent Cloisters. Prior and Confessor . Prior.
Say, hast thou found Alfonso? Con.
                                         No, good Prior.
He mus'd not in his cell, nor duely came
To join th'assembled monks,
Ere the fixt duties of the convent call'd
Each to his separate office. Prior.
                                         'Tis most strange. Con.
I have made careful search, and closely question'd
The brethren, one by one. Prior.
Who last beheld him? Con.
Juan. At dawn while he unbarr'd the gates,
Alfonso darted forth
Striking his breast in anguish. Prior.
                                         Heav'n protect him!
Sooth, all ye sainted host, his woe-worn soul! Con.
Alas! my mind misgives me. Prior.
                     How? Con.
                                         I fear
We ne'er shall see him more. Unhappy man!
Our holy Provost to these walls returns
To fix anew our duties. Much methinks
He dreads the issue of that solemn inquest,
Which here confirms him in his perilous charge,
His only solace: or for ever drives him
[25]   From this lone roof. To him he must reveal
[Page 236]

The anguish of his spirit. Hapless man!
Fain had he died unknown! Prior.
                                         Hear, holy Saint!
Thou, who didst found 'mid everlasting snows
These walls, thy earthly residence, look down!
Look down on him whose unremitted zeal
At life's dread risk, has highly minister'd
To thy most blest intent!—Hear, holy Bernard,
Nor to the storm and conflict of dark passion,
Abandon poor Alfonso! Con.
                                         Yes, my brother,
Service like his, nor wealth, nor worldly honours
Gain or repay: its source is in the heart;
And in the spirit that there prompts to act,
Finds its sole recompense. Prior.
                                         If fervent pray'rs,
If tears of gratitude by others shed,
The pilgrim and lone stranger, at life's hazard,
By brave Alfonso rescu'd from destruction,
Could heal the wound that bleeds with inward pangs
Peace on his soul had shed her lenient balm:
But 'tis not so with him. Con.
                                         No—many a time
When the lost travellers, whom his arm from far
[50]   Bore 'mid the howling night-storm, whom his hand
Long chaf'd before the hearth, with grateful look
First turn'd th'awaken'd eye on poor Alfonso,
Who hung all pity o'er the seeming corse:
How have I seen him from his dark cheek dash
The tear away, and fly the open'd lip
That pour'd its blessing on him.
[Page 237]
Steward enters with Laymen bearing logs, &c. Stew.
                                         Haste, my friends,
Rake up the embers, pile the glowing hearth
With unctuous pine,
The sight shall cheer him, and the crackling blaze
Breathe grateful fragrance round. Then, deck the board,
And freely cull what best may furnish out
Our frugal banquet.                                          [Exeunt Laymen. Con.
                                         Whence this sudden haste? Stew.
Ring out the convent bell, that the loud peal
Recal each absent brother. None must fail
Of their accustom'd duty. Prior.
                                         Stay, good Steward. Stew.
The Provost is expected, and each moment
We look to greet him. Prior.
                                         All good angels guide him!
But say who brought
The welcome news? for scarce the lower rocks
Peep thro' the snow: and, save some pilgrim bound
[75]   On fearful penance, and that mournful train
Who left at morn the convent, none have dar'd
The dangerous pass. Stew.
                                         You know the southern guide. Prior.
What, faithful Claude? He, who for many a season
Has claim'd the convent prize, his custom'd due
Who from the pass first clears the drifted snows? Stew.
The same. He left our long-expected Provost
[Page 238]

Now as he slowly up the mountain toil'd.
Farewell; my charge awaits me.                                          [Exit. Prior.
                                         Peace be with you!
Alas, no common call, in this rude season,
Has forc'd good Albert, bow'd with weight of years,
To leave the shelter of the peaceful vale.
'Tis not alone to fix our separate charge;
Mandates from Rome, strictly to scrutinize
Each layman and poor hind that serves the convent,
(For rumour dwells on bad men harbour'd here)
Now urge his step. Con.
                                         Full well we know his mission
That shames this sacred roof. Alas! that slander
Should feign, that here the ruffian and fell murderer
Unquestion'd guests, have found familiar shelter.
Such haunt not here. Sad years of ceaseless wars
That long have wasted fair Italia's plain,
[100]   Turning to barrenness her fruitful soil,
Have steel'd men's hearts; and, haply, from the camp,
Outcasts, who prowl when late the battle bled,
And pluck'd, 'tis said, while the warm blood yet flows
The covering from the wound, at times have sought
Night shelter from the storm. Else, never here
Have lawless men found refuge. Prior.
                                         Go, my brother,
Ere Albert yet arrives, search out once more
Alfonso's lonely haunt. Heav'n guide thy steps!                                          [Exeunt.

END OF ACT THE FIRST.

[Page 239]
ACT II. SCENE I. The Convent Hall. Provost, Prior, Confessor , other Brethren, and Laymen. Pro. [to the Laymen.]
Brothers! no charge of murder rests on them.
Depart in peace, my friends! Heav'n's blessing on you!
Would that the princes of the world, and those
That sigh on golden beds, could lay, like you,
Hands innocent of ill, on guiltless hearts,
And taste such sleep as yours! depart in peace! Sacristan enters. Sac.
Alfonso is return'd—yet—hapless man! Pro.
Why stands he not, as duty bids, before us? Sac.
Oh he is loth to come. Pro.
                                         This is most strange. Sac.
I found him, in the cemetery, lone,
'Mid many a stranger corse, unsepulchred,
Still-gazing on that pilgrim, lately found
When slipt the snow-heap from the southern ridge.
His face was yet unchang'd, and calm each feature
As when he rested on the snow, while death
[Page 240]

Stole on his sleep. So calm, Alfonso look't,
Such too his smile: each seem'd the other's image:
Scarce could I tell who of the twain had life,
Or who had ceas'd to breathe. Pardon me, father,
Long-time I fear'd to break that solemn trance,
And when at last I rous'd him. Con. [interrupting him.]
'Twas not kind
To rouse him, brother. Well I know his nature,
[25]   You should have spar'd him yet a little while,
'Tis long since holy peace has still'd his spirit:
That time his soul had converse with its maker. Pro.
But when at last you urg'd him— Sac.
                                         At the word
At once the trance dissolv'd—he started up,
And frowning darkly on me, bad me say
That never earthly ear should hear his grief,
If thou reject his pray'r, to wear out life
Here, amid perilous labours—thus he left me,
And onward 'mid the mountains swiftly rush'd,
Regardless of my answer. Prior.
                                         Holy father!
Send forth the Confessor: with him alone
He communes willingly: but shuns us ever,
Save when a sufferer common aid demands. Con.
Yes, I have sooth'd his melancholy soul,
And won at times to half-form'd confidence,
By tales of woe which breath'd to tranquil minds
Had rack'd the soul with horror: still to these
He gives most heedful ear. Pro.
                                         Go, sooth, persuade him.                                          [To the Confessor, who departs.
[Page 241]

It must be strange unexpiated guilt
Harrows his soul: and was it right, good Prior,
To give him charge among you? Prior.
[50]                                            He deserv'd it.
Such thoughts as trouble you, at first came o'er us,
When with wan look distraught, and wild attire,
He call'd at midnight, when no foot beside
Long time had scal'd the snows. Our wary eye
Watch'd o'er him. Stern his brow, and strange his mood,
Yet at our call most zealous: so months past,
He still the same. When patient Anselm died,
(Heav'n rest his soul! he fell in manhood's prime,
Worn out with toil) Alfonso, now long-tried,
Here vow'd to pass his dedicated days
A cloister'd menial, and with earnest pray'r
Besought his perilous office. Look on us:
Age and infirmity here bow before you.
Point out the man whose limbs could stand that charge. Pro.
None—none; I blame you not. But say, good Prior,
How doth he exercise his charge? Prior.
                                         With zeal
Passing belief. His labour shames our service:
For still in boist'rous months, when all within
Shake at the tempest's roar, and icy blast,
Singly he ventures forth, his dog sole guide,
At starless midnight, or when drifted heaps
Have hid the pass: nor seeks again the roof,
(Tho' numbness steal on his o'erwearied limbs)
[Page 242]

[75]   Till he has sounded each snow-cover'd cave,
And long and loudly call'd, if heard from far
Shrieks of the lost night-wanderer strike his ear.
So pass his days away. Claude enters.
Oh holy fathers! Pro.
                                         Claude, what brings thee hither? Claude.
Help, speedy help! or she for whom I beg
Will not long need your succour. [to the Infirmier.] Good, good father,
This is thy office. Yes, we know thee well,
We who frequent these mountains. Pro.
                                         Take thy cordials:
Rare medicines: and this strongly scented oil.
Its essence once inhaled, thro' closed lips
Will call the spirit back! Inf.
                                         Where are the sufferers?
And what their numbers? Claude.
                                         'Tis but one poor soul,—
A delicate tender creature: one of those
That left at noon your roof. She would away:
Though at that time, methought, a deadly paleness
Was settled in her face.—Oh how it griev'd me! Inf.
But where, where are they? Claude.
                                         They had past the storm-house
Where, every day, at noon, and fall of night,
Ye kindly leave, for those who chance may need,
[100]   A dole of bread and wine: this, they had past
[Page 243]

A little space, when they who bore the litter
In which she lay, slipp'd on the melted ice:
And much I fear the fall has quite o'erpow'r'd her.
I never thought that thing of such slight frame
Could heave so deep a groan. And so I help'd them
To bear her to the shed, then hurried hither
To claim your aid. Inf.
                                         Come, honest Claude.—Farewell! [to the Monks.] Pro.
Heav'n guide, and prosperous issue crown your labour!
Say, was she of that train whom late I greeted
Where rushing from the mountain snows, the flood
Ceaselessly roars? Prior.
                                         No other foot but theirs
Has dared the pass. Pro.
                                         In vain I urg'd them back.
Know you their names? Pri.
                                         They wish'd to be conceal'd.
Some secret cause of grief ('twas whisper'd so)
Unmeet to be divulg'd to common ears,
Silenc'd enquiry. Yet a prattling page
Who loiter'd o'er the hearth, said that his lady,
The dark-stol'd dame, was Countess of Tortona:
And he did hint of a poor peasant girl
Tales of strange import—but we sought not out
[125]   What misery wish'd conceal'd. Pro.
The noon-bell strikes.
Come, holy duties call our thoughts to heav'n—
Here meet again. Alfonso must be question'd.                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 244]
Scene changes to the Storm-house, on one side of the rocky pass, amid the Mountains Agnes, Ellen in a litter sleeping, Attendants, Blanche and Laura. Agnes.
So—gently bring her to the open air.
A soothing sleep steals o'er her: soft she breathes.
How sweet her tranquil look! and lo, that smile:
As if an angel touch'd with earthly woe
Look'd down upon her slumber. Blan.
                                         Such art thou
In mortal semblance. Agnes. [looking on her.]
Sleep, poor hapless Ellen!
Three painful years are pass'd, since I have watch'd thee,
And laid thy stranger brow upon my breast.
I have assuag'd thy bitterness of grief,
Sooth'd the wild dreams of a distracted mind,
And led thee to the view of opening heav'n,
Where tears are turn'd to gladness: but such sleep
Till now has ne'er been thine. Francis enters.
                                         Francis! Oh say,
Will they proceed? Fran.
                                         No golden bribe will tempt.
I have explor'd the further tract. Agnes.
                                         Well, Francis!
[Page 245]
Fran.
It is impassable. Agnes.
[150]                                            Oh say not so.
I will myself explore it. Fran.
                                         None can pass.
The rock more rugged far: and that bright sun
Which cheer'd at dawn of day, its noon now past,
Has turn'd to foaming streams the melted snow. Agnes.
Yet, if the convent send sufficient aid,
Still, still we may proceed. Fran.
                                         E're I turn'd back
Reluctantly, (I know thy stedfast mind,)
Prone from a crag that overhung the road
A snow mount thunder'd down, and barr'd all progress.
Some from the convent soon will join our guides,
And warrant safe return; and, pardon lady!
I have long serv'd you. Agnes.
                                         Say whate'er thou wilt.
Thy lord esteem'd thee highly. Fran.
                                         Aye, these arms
Oft fondled him in childhood. Agnes.
                                         By his side
Thou hast in battle stood, when many a warrior
Fled from the field. The man whom Julian honor'd
I hold my friend. Say on, nor fear offence. Fran.
Would I had died in battle at his feet,
E're liv'd till now: e're seen what now I see,
[175]   The Countess of Tortona like a slave,
Tending a peasant girl: one too, who lur'd,
Aye, and by witching wiles;— Agnes. [interrupting him.]
                                         No, not thy virtues,
[Page 246]

Nor privilege of years, nor length of service,
Zeal for my house and honour shall avail,
If ere thy rash unhallow'd breath shall whisper
Disgrace on her. Rather aloud revile
The memory of him whom most I honour;
The man, who but for this, had proudly stood
'Mid men unrivall'd: if thou deem it base
To serve my will because I sooth her woe,
Such service I disclaim—gold thou shalt have,
But never look to see my face again.
Thou art in tears: nay, rise. Fran.
                                         Not look on me!
And give me gold! I am indeed most vile.
I never felt what service was till now.
If you do wish my death, bid me begone.
I rashly spoke what zeal for you inspir'd.
She was not the seducer. Agnes.
                                         Peace, good Francis!
You touch a string that vibrates on my heart.
Still calm her sleep?                                          [To the Attendants. Blan.
                     Most tranquil. Agnes.
[200]                                            Such repose
I fear bodes nought but evil. From the convent
None yet arrive. 'Tis vain without their aid
To move her hence. Fran.
                                         They will be here, ere long.
The guide, whose ready zeal so won our hearts,
Was fresh, and nimble footed. Agnes.
                                         Go, my friend!
Yon height commands afar the winding path:
Look, if you see aught hastening.                                          [He goes.
[Page 247]

                                         Julian! Julian!
Thy word enjoin'd not this: but not till death
Has still'd that woe-worn frame, will I forsake her.
But thou!
Oh art thou with the living! or with those
That grieve no more? what earthly voice can speak!
Since that dread hour (oh! let me not recal it!)
My search how vain! and save that fatal scroll
Which bad me raise thy tomb, and deem thee dead,
Gave me thy worldly wealth, and loos'd the tie
That binds eternally my soul to thine,
Of thee I nought have heard. Wert thou on earth,
This now had been thy office. No. I wrong thee.
He who sustains my soul, and bids me, here,
Shelter in life's last agonies the orphan,
[225]   And her that has no helper, had once more
Made one our wedded hearts. Francis , the Infirmier, Claude , Guide, Laymen, enter. Fran. [to the Infirmier.]
                                         Haste! holy father. Inf.
Where is the sufferer? Agnes.
                                         Here, in still repose. Inf.
Has she long slumber'd thus? Agnes.
                                         An hour, or more. Inf.
Rouse, rouse her quickly. Chafe her temples, lady!
Here, hold this pungent spirit.                                          [Ellen sighs. Agnes.
                                         Oh that sigh! Inf.
You of the southern climes, you haply know not,
[Page 248]

Amid these chilling snows when sleep steals on,
How fatally it ends! the blood too rests,
And every vital part forgets its function.
Sleep here is but the harbinger of death. Agnes.
The harbinger of death! oh rouse her not:
Sir, she is broken-hearted. Inf.
                                         I must do
What duty bids, and with unwearied zeal
Apply all earthly means to bring back life.
The rest is Heav'n's. Agnes. [to the Servants.]
She wakes—stand, stand apart!
How is it with you, Ellen? Ellen.
                                         Well—quite well—
Free from all pain. Agnes.
[250]                                            Your cheek, methinks, is ting'd
With a faint flush like renovated health,
But weak, most weak your voice. Why do you gaze
So earnestly around? these are your friends,
Those of my household whom you ever lov'd,
Blanche, and kind-hearted Laura: this good man,
One of the convent brethren. Ellen.
                                         I scarce knew
Whether I liv'd or not. I've been in heav'n:
You too were there: indeed I ever thought you
Too good for this vile world. Agnes.
                                         Compose thyself. Ellen.
I am most calm. Agnes.
                     Oh hush. Ellen.
                                         I am not wandering.
But most distinctly as I now behold you,
[Page 249]

I saw you there. [pointing up.] And I, poor Ellen, help'd
To place a crown of glory on your brow.
And there came one—I dare not, Saint on earth!
Before your honour'd presence breathe his name.
He, in this world, has had his doom of woe.
Oh say that you forgive me—ne'er, till now,
While my poor mind was mine— Inf.
                                         This must not be.
Daughter! be still! speak to her, tender lady!
[275]   Speak, if thy gushing tears permit the utterance. Agnes.
Sweet Ellen! clasp my hand. Ellen.
                                         Thou more than parent!
Had not thine eye met mine, when first I woke,
I had not thank'd this charitable man
For forcing life upon me. Oh! I faint. Agnes.
Here, on my bosom rest. Ellen.
                                         Thou art most kind.
Yes, I shall soon have rest: eternal rest,
And thou thy heavenly crown.                                          [Swoons. Inf.
                                         Here—bear her up. Agnes.
Oh gently with her. Inf.
                                         Good St. Bernard, aid us!                                          [Exeunt.

Scene, a Lake on the South side of the Convent surrounded with Mountains covered with snow. Alfonso pacing restlessly to and fro. Alfonso. Alf.
Ye mountains! on whose heights when first ye tow'r'd,
Coeval winter stood! hoar cliffs! where Time
From the first stretch and waving of his wing,
Shed everlasting snows! oh hear my voice,
Fall on my brow! and thou, on which I tread,
Immoveable rock! rive thy deep base beneath me,
Nor give me back, till at th'appointed hour
I, and each secret sinner upon earth
Stand up, and hear the doom that shall not change.
It will not be conceal'd! they shall hear all:
Or I once more on that loath'd world beneath,
Must stand all lonely 'mid the moving press
[300]   Like one, on whom the blue plague, as it past,
Shed visible taint. Confessor without.
                     Alfonso! Alf.
                     Ha! Confessor enters. Con.
                                         Alfonso—
'Tis he. I long have sought thee—louldly call'd—
And thrice the convent bell has warn'd thee back. Alf.
It 'scap'd me not unheard. Conf.
                                         The Provost sent me—
[Page 251]
Alf.
Consents he to my wishes? Con.
                                         Trust his kindness. Alf.
He comes to search my soul. Con.
                                         Not your's alone.
Each layman, every hind that serves the convent,
Have render'd strict account. Alf.
                                         Pure sinless souls!
Why wound their spirit with unfounded questions?
They have not shed man's blood. Con.
'Tis true, they urg'd th'enquiry. Alf.
                                         And ere now
Each to his day-task hies with lighten'd heart,
Merrily trolling forth his mountain song:
Each with the good man's blessing on his head. Con.
So shall thy soul find peace. Alf.
                                         Oh never—never. Con.
[325]   Thou dost not know his kindness, but thy deeds
Are known to him— Alf. [troubled.]
What deeds? Con.
                                         All, all, whate'er
Zeal and unwearied toil, and dauntless courage
Have wrought at life's dread risque. Alf.
                                         Would I had perish'd
In rescuing others! Con.
                                         Why thus dread the Provost?
To him reveal thy grief:
He is not, as some are who wear our garb,
Of soul austere. Virtue in him beams forth
With seraph mercy: and his way of life
'Mid scenes of misery, but in closer bonds
[Page 252]

Links him with those that suffer. And hoar age,
That draws his spirit nearer to his God,
Looks kindly back on those who toil below.
If thou hast sinn'd, in him the penitent sinner
Beholds a father— Alf.
                                         But I have not shed
The tear of penitence. Who probes my soul,
Must loath the thing I am. I shall pour forth
To his astonish'd and incredulous ear,
Guilt that shall shock his soul, while tears gush forth
In pity of man's weakness. Con.
[350]                                            Calm thy spirit— Alf. [highly agitated.]
These rocks have heard it; and the night-storm borne
On his dark wing, 'mid cliffs, and hollow caves
My echoed groans; and I have quak'd to hear,
Sounds as of men, accomplices in guilt,
Muttering their tales of murder. Con.
                                         Sooth him, Heav'n!
Be calm, Alfonso; these wild burst of passion
Will but arouse suspicion.—Why thus grasp me? Alf.
Suspicion! Who beheld me? Where th'accuser?
Come to the Provost. Con.
                                         Not till thou art calm.
None shall behold thee thus, so strangely mov'd.
I oft have still'd thy grief. Alf.
                                         Thou art most kind. Con.
Look round; this scene shall sooth thee:
Long years may pass, ere in these storm tost heights,
[Page 253]

A sky so clear, air of such temperate breath,
And sun with scarce a cloud to veil his glory
May visit us again. Alf.
                                         Oh holy comforter!
Scenes such as these have rais'd my voice in pray'r,
'Mid solitudes where none on earth could hear.
Oh that the innocent joys of days long past
Might steal me from myself, like lenient dreams
[375]   Of friends that are no more. Con.
                                         Nay, inly brood not.
Look on yon azure sky, and call on Heav'n.—
Oh hang not o'er that lake which stilly sleeps:
Its hue is dark and dreary: tho' it spread
A polished mirror to the rocks around.
Why dost thou gaze so fixedly upon it? Alf.
Look where the shape of yon o'erhanging crag
That thwarts the sun, lies shadow'd on the lake,
How suddenly th'gathering ice shoots on,
Chilling the wave beneath.
E'en so it fares with me—the winter, here,                                          [Striking his breast.
Turns every object that the eye doth glance on,
To its own cheerless nature. [Starts back from the lake in the utmost agitation.]
                                         Heav'n and earth!
Saw, saw you it? Con.
                                         Whence that wild look of horror?
Why start away? Alf. [looking round.]
Where did the spectre vanish? Con.
What spectre? I beheld none.
[Page 254]
Alf.
                                         That—that form
Which scowl'd upon me, there— [pointing to the lake.] not earthly, sure?
Oh never yet did flesh and blood assume
Such ghastly semblance: never living eye
So look'd. Con.
[400]   Oh merciful Heav'n! Alf.
                                         I do conjure you,
Oh tell me—am I then that ghastly form?
Was it myself? was there none other here? Con.
It was thy shadow'd form. Alf. [vehemently.]
                                         Come to the Provost.
What need of vain confession? guilt is on me:
Deep graven by the visible hand of heav'n,
Like his that bore upon his brow the blood
Of the first slain. Come to the Provost, haste!                                          [Exeunt.

END OF ACT THE SECOND.

[Page 255]
ACT III. SCENE I. The Hall of the Convent. Monks in Council. Provost, Prior, Infirmier, Steward. Prior.
I hear their steps. Alf. [without.]
                                         That, that, or nought on earth
Shall force it force me— Prior.
                                         Hark! it is his voice.
We pray thee, kindly question him. Alfonso and Confessor enter. Pro.
                                         Alfonso,
I come not arm'd with harsh authority
To wound th'afflicted soul: not mine the office
From the reluctant bosom, ere the time,
To pluck th'unripe confession: rather mine
To praise thy deeds, and here, before the brethren
Proclaim thy high desert. Alf.
                                         It is the motive
Alone that sanctions all. I claim no praise. Pro.
Bow not beneath despair. Whate'er thy crime,
Know that, unceasing at the gates of mercy,
A beckoning spirit calls aloud to earth,
“Thou, who hast sinn'd, repent, and sin no more:
“Kneel here, and enter in.”
[Page 256]
Alf.
                                         Yes, I have sinn'd— Pro.
So have we all. Alf.
                                         But mine are deadly sins. Pro.
Great is heaven's mercy; and our holy church
Has pray'rs and pennances of pow'r to cleanse
[25]   The soul from all pollution. Alf.
                                         Not from mine.
Penance to me! who, watchful of the sound,
Heard the night tempest call, and walk'd abroad
When nought but heaven's avenging ministers
The lightning and wing'd whirlwind mov'd on earth!
Talk not to me of pennance. Pro.
                                         Art thou one
Who once knew better days: one, whom fair fortune
Allur'd to summer seas, then left at once
A lonely wreck? Alf.
                                         I have known better days.
No other terms shall force the secret from me.                                          [to himself. Pro.
Discourse not with thyself; to me give answer.
Hast thou by stern necessity compell'd,
To deeds against thy nature, link'd with men
Of lawless life, and stain'd thy soul with blood,
To silence the accuser? Prior.
                                         Holy Provost!
We, we will answer this: no stain of blood
Rests on Alfonso. Alf.
                                         Answer'st thou for me?
[Page 257]

Ye know me not, nor e'er shall hear my crime,
Till thou hast promis'd, nay by oath confirm'd,
That whatsoe'er the guilt which I reveal,
[50]   Thou will't not drive me hence. Thus far be known:
That of such deeds as now you question me,
Wealth gain'd by force, and cool deliberate murder
To silence the accuser, I am guiltless.
Grant this, or I am mute. Pro.
                                         Hear, man of guilt!
And when I speak with Heav'n's authority:
Bow to the dust. Alf.
                                         Deep guilt doth weigh me down.
But I'll not speak: nor shall ye force me hence.
Look here: behold this scar; no battle wound,
Tho' I have bled in war. This impious hand
Struck at my life: and, if ye force me hence,
Think on his guilt, the slayer of himself!—
Beware! beware! ye know not what it is:—
But I have fought the demon of despair,
And sunk beneath the strife. Pro.
                                         Sinner, I come
Such as thyself, the heir of frailty,
Shackled and gall'd with man's infirmities,
To weep with thee, to bend my knee with thine,
Teach thee, like me, to raise thy hands in pray'r,
And meekly shed the penitential tear
That drops down healing. Speak to me, my son!
He, who conjures thee, spreads a father's arms
[75]   To fold thee to his bosom. Alf.
                                         Kind, kind man!
Thou shalt hear all: I will obey thy voice,
[Page 258]

But—oh—in pity—force me not, I pray thee,
To that strange world below: here let me labour
What yet remains of life: not long the term.
Vigils and painful service soon must end me:
Look on this wasted frame. Pro.
                                         Here rest in peace!
If peace here visit thee. Alf. [kneels to him.]
                                         Thanks, gracious father! Pro.
Disclose thy name, thy rank, what urg'd thee hither,
And what mysterious motive here enchains thee
To such dread hazards, that the oath-bound monk
Shrinks from the toil. Alf.
                                         All shall be fully told.
Julian my name. Wealth and fair heritage
Of lands and castled towns, amid the Peers
Of ducal Milan, rank'd me first in pow'r:
My palace tow'r'd on proud Tortona's brow,
And I—its lord. Prior.
                                         Thou—thou, Tortona's Count!
'Twas but this morn— Alf. [interrupting him.]
Nay—if you disbelieve,
You'll hear strange things. Pro. [to the Prior.]
[100]                                            Be silent—one rash word
May all confuse. Alf.
                                         About my twentieth year,
Ten years now past; [gradually becomes more and more confused.] nay—wonder not. These locks
Once dark as jet, on sudden chang'd to grey,
That night I stabb'd myself: and, whence this cheek
[Page 259]

With more than time's deep traces sadly furrow'd,
Your haunts can witness. At my twentieth year—
Till then, each wish indulg'd, that Fancy form'd.
Oh had I, ere that time, by Heav'n's kind chast'ning,
But tasted at the brim, but sipp'd one drop
Of that sad cup whose bitter dregs I drain,
Haply I had not been the man I am!
Virtue had charms for me. No—no. It sprung not
From Heav'n's eternal root: 'twas the frail flow'r
That gaily blossoms in life's sunshine day.
I pray your pardon.—
Where left I off? Pro.
                                         You said your twentieth year. Alf.
That was the time, when brave Novara's lord,
Stricken by age, but still in heart a warrior,
Proclaim'd a tournament: his daughter's hand
The envied prize: if he who gain'd the field
Made oath, when wedded, at his own free charge
To arm five hundred knights, all cas'd in steel,
[125]   In right of Sforza's heir, from Milan's throne
Driven by ambitious France. Pro.
                                         We know those wars. Alf.
I went, I won the prize; a beauteous bride,
One whose rare mind, high-character'd, o'erpast
All that the eye-presag'd of inward worth.
Ill fated Agnes! breath'd a man on earth
Who slightingly had nam'd thee, on his head
My sword had thy pre-eminence maintain'd,
Peerless above thy sex. Yet—her I left—
Not then—not then. Five years first glided on,
Five peaceful years—and—happiness was—her's.
[Page 260]

Then came the wars, and all the accidents
Of doubtful conflict. With our forces march'd
The Banneret that led the hardy Swiss:
One for his skill in arms call'd from his flock:
A swain, but proud of soul.
What needs his name? that time I sav'd his life,
And he too rescued mine—him—him—I murder'd. Pro.
Oh heav'n!
Him who had sav'd thy life! what demon urg'd thee? Alf. [highly agitated.]
Here, here the peasant smote me. The wide world
Has rung with my disgrace—a soldier's blood
Boils in these veins: but seek not out the cause.
He should have plung'd his dagger in my heart,
[150]   As mine was sheath'd in his: deep in the heart.
That had been noble vengeance—but—a blow! Pro.
Vengeance! for what? Alf.
                                         His sister—oh! his sister!
Oh, miserable Ellen!—
Her, her I wedded. Pro.
You said Novara's daughter was your wife. Alf. [much agitated.]
Yet, yet I wedded Ellen—didst thou think
One of such purity, not angels purer,
Had deign'd to meet my love, save that she deem'd
A husband's rightful arms were linkt in hers. Pro.
But where is Ellen? Alf.
                     Ha! Pro.
                                         Tortona's Countess
Erewhile— Alf. [half frantic]
Where, where is Ellen?
[Page 261]

Would that I saw that angel stretch'd before me
In any form of death: her pale cheek cold;
And the mild languor of her azure eye
Fixt as I gaz'd upon it! would to heav'n
That on your barbarous rocks I found her corse,
Transfixt with light'ning! so she were but dead.
Then, ere th'avenger call'd, I should once more
Know what it is to weep. Oh! Ellen, Ellen!                                          [He weeps. Pro.
His tears gush forth. May it relieve his anguish! Prior.
[175]   Oh! cease to torture him. Pro.
                                         He looks more calm.
Each tear, that trickles down his cheek, allays
His troubled spirit. Alf.
                                         Yet—a little while,
Kind men! I will be brief—ye must not leave me,
It weighs less heavy here. Pro.
                                         Another time! Alf.
Heav'n may not grant again an hour like this.
In the last battle at Novara's siege,
When Tremouille and Trevulci led the foe,
And, from their steeds dismounted, Gaul's brave knights
Stood with portended spears, in firm array
Immoveable. When fear had seiz'd our host,
The Banneret and I, in arms sworn brothers,
Rush'd emulous on, and in our breasts receiv'd
Th'opposing points. Our men, the opening made,
Follow'd and conquer'd. As we bleeding lay,
“Be thou, (he said) a brother to an orphan,
[Page 262]

“Who has but me.” I vow'd, and swoon'd upon him.
When next I woke, 'twas in Novara's walls:
Of him no more was known. Pro.
                                         You said you slew him. Alf.
You shall hear all.
The Duke restor'd, when war had ceas'd to rage,
[200]   My name and rank disguis'd, I went as one
Dear to her brother: and within a dell,
Lock'd in by heights which scarce the neighb'ring swain
Cross'd with his flock at summer, found the orphan.
Oh! at the sight of her, the peasant girl,
My soul at once discover'd why I sigh'd,
Clasp'd in Novara's arms. Spare the recital.
I wooed, I won, and wedded her. Pro.
                                         How! wedded! Alf.
I wedded Ellen, aye, and time flew by
In bliss not earthly, while remembrance slept:
But when the fiend was rous'd, fang'd scorpions stung me.
At times, false cause pretended, I withdrew,
Short absence, to Tortona: there the smile
That ever met me,
Arm'd with new sting the viper at my heart.
I had less keenly suffer'd, had reproof
Scowl'd at my entrance: it was never so.
But oh! the curse! while Agnes clasp'd my neck
My thought was of another! on a day,
When annual feast and revels rous'd Tortona,
In honour of our nuptials: as the pomp
Mov'd on, the Countess radiant at my side,
[Page 263]

Forth rush'd the Banneret; yet, yet, I hear him.
“Traitor! receive from him who sav'd thy life
[225]   “Fit meed for guilt like thine:” he spoke and struck me,
Struck me, Novara's daughter by my side.
Then my swift steel— Pro.
                                         I thought— Alf. [interrupting him.]
                                         'Twas there he fell,
But died in Ellen's arms: and his last breath
Bound her to break the tie that link'd her soul
To perjury and murder. I return'd:
At sight of me, for still our hearts were one,
Her woe to frenzy rose. That time this hand
Aim'd at my life: heav'n will'd not so my death:
Tho' rumour widely spread it. Pro.
                                         At our hearth
We too have heard, confusedly told, thy death:
And the hous'd pilgrim still describes the tomb
Rais'd by thy Countess; where each day and night,
All hours, unwearied orisons call down
Heav'n's mercy on thy soul. Alf.
                                         The loud report
Had struck on Ellen's ear: for now she knew
Her base seducer. Pro.
                     How! Alf.
                                         The Banneret
(Escap'd from chains,) returning to his home,
Found on her neck my picture; but no voice
[250]   Ere told, till now, that I, Tortona's lord,
Garb'd like a peasant of the northern Alps,
Watch'd at craz'd Ellen's side, where'er she stray'd,
[Page 264]

Begg'd from poor hinds, and forc'd, where pray'rs avail'd not,
The scanty meal that fed her. None e'er told
That oft, to sooth her woe, o'er unknown rocks
I toil'd, and smooth'd her way to Milan's vale:
And clasp'd her in these arms when on my tomb
She sunk in tearless swoon. 'Twas never known
When months had thus gone by, and lenient time
Had still'd her groans: that while with heav'n-rais'd eye,
She breath'd my name, and kiss'd my pictur'd semblance,
That I forgetful, gaz'd too fondly on her,
And all the truth flash'd forth. Pro.
                                         I dread th'event. Alf.
She started from my arms, while tears, methought,
Gush'd down her glowing cheek.
Then turning suddenly to one I saw not,
“Be thou obey'd! (she cried) and, thus address'd me.
“Kneel on this tomb, and swear by him in heav'n,
“Thou ne'er wilt trace my wanderings, ne'er enquire
“If weal or woe betide: ne'er look on Ellen
“Till dead, or dying—swear, that so my blessing
“May rest on thee hereafter.” I obey'd,
Nor ever saw her more. Where is she now?
[275]   Is the deep slumber of the dead upon her? [frantic.]
Weeps she, or raves, lone, reft of every friend?
Hark! hark! on me she calls—I come.
[Page 265]
Pro.
                                         Restrain him.
Oh hold his struggling limbs. Soothe, soothe him heav'n! Alf. [after violently struggling, breaks from them.]
Ye shall not hold me here, unseen of men:
No, I will stalk commission'd o'er the world
Like Heav'n's enquiring spirit. Guilt shall shake
At my approach, and youth turn grey before me.
Look, when I view the boy in lustihood
Of health and beauty, as he reels along
To the deluded virgin, in his grasp
I will infix this dagger. At my bidding
The breast, that glow'd beneath his touch, shall bleed.
She too, shall deem the blow. Oh! Ellen! answer.—
Far kinder than the kiss that fir'd her soul.
There end her woes: and while she rests in peace
His eye may look on heav'n: mine never more.                                          [bursts away. Pro.
Haste, haste! restrain him! bring him back, my brothers!

ACT IV. SCENE I. A Cave amidst the Mountains. Two Assassins disguised like the native Mountaineers. 1 Assas.
The time is past: they promis'd quick return.
This steel lacks blood. 2 Assas.
Our booty shall not fail. Be patient, brother. 1 Assas.
Why did you lure us from the southern plains?
There still, if plunder fail'd, earth's grassy bed
Refresh'd our weary limbs, and the blue sky
Look'd kindly on our slumber. Here— 2 Assas.
                                         Be patient—
Our long expected prize, Tortona's wealth,
Ere long shall far o'erpay these transient toils. 1 Assas.
Aye, if we seize the Countess. 2 Assas.
                                         If we seize her!
How can she 'scape? 1 Assas.
                                         The pass below is open,
Secure from danger, by the Provost's guides
Clear'd from the snows. 2 Assas.
                                         No, not if trusty Gualter
Has faithfully obey'd me.
[Page 267]
Gualter and a Third Assassin enter. 1 Assas.
                                         See, he comes. 2 Assas.
Well, Gualter! Gual.
                                         All is done: prepare your poniards.
Yet—'tis an easy prey. One man in arms
Alone attends the dame. When I had track'd
The Provost to the convent, I return'd
[25]   O'er pathless crags, and from the mountain peak
That beetled o'er the pass, with this good pole
Loosen'd the snow-mass. None can pass. 1 Assas.
                                         Away.
Stab those that dare resist: but spare the Countess:
Her ransom shall enrich us. Gual.
                                         Lead us forth!                                          [Exeunt. Scene, Mountains cover'd with Snow, overhanging the Pass, on the North Side of the Convent. Alfonso climbing over the Rocks. Alfonso. Alf.
What! force me back!
Roof me in cloyster'd cells, where never sun
Glanc'd on the face of man! must they explore
Which way I tread: and track me to my haunts,
Like some ferocious beast that makes his lair
In the unfrequented wilderness! what am I?
A wretch, moon-stricken, to be watch'd and bound:
Unfit to bide where man makes residence?
[Page 268]

Would that I were not, what indeed I am!
Or being what I am, in form a man,
That heav'n had cast me in the ideot mould,
Of those that in the valley gasp in the sun,
With disproportion'd throats: and uncouth limbs,
That know not their own use. Con. [behind the scenes.]
                                         Alfonso! ho! Alf.
Shout on! shout on! here none will look to find me:
Or if they chance to spy me, who will dare
Climb up this giddy edge? they nigh had seiz'd me,
[50]   But for that jutting point on which I sprung,
While they past on beneath. Sacristan and Confessor enter. Sac.
                                         See you the track
Of his uncertain step amid the snow? Con.
It ceas'd on sudden. Sac.
                                         Long my eye pursu'd it,
In mazy shiftings all irregular. Con.
Aye, purposely confus'd to mock pursuit.
He's fled, I fear, for ever. Alf. [wildly laughing.]
Ha! ha! ha! Sac.
Heard you that noise? Con.
                                         Sure from the air it burst:
For never foot of man
E'er scal'd these mountains. Sac.
                                         Let us once more hail him.
Alfonso! ho—Alfonso!                                          [Clashing of swords heard behind the scenes.
[Page 269]
Agnes. [behind the scenes.]
Murder—Help—Murder. Fran. [behind the scenes.]
This good sword shall free you. Agnes. [behind the scenes.]
Help from the convent, help. Sac.
What cry was that? Con.
                                         I heard the cry of murder.
Hark! 'tis the clash of swords. Francis and the Infirmier enter.
                                         [to Francis. Speak—wherefore thus.
Thy looks stare wildly—there is blood upon thee. Fran. [to the Infirmier.]
Your limbs are fresh, back to the convent, haste.
[75]   Ring out th'alarum bell. [Infirmier goes.] Three men, assassins,
Disguis'd like those that on the mountains urge
The chamois chase, have seiz'd the hapless ladies.
I battled, long as these sore-mangled limbs
Could stand their poniards. Alf. [leaping from the rock, and snatching his sword.]
                                         See! th'avenger here!
Wash off, kind heav'n! the murder on this blade,
By the assassin's blood. Come, lead the way.
I have in battle cop'd with mighty men,
And foil'd proud warriors. Fran.
                                         Give me, Sir, your arm.
My wounds bleed fast                                          [Exeunt.

Scene, another part of the Mountains. Agnes , Countess of Tortona, Ellen , Assassins. Agnes.
If 'tis my wealth you seek, I gave you all. Assas.
Dame, if your strength had match'd your fearless mind,
Your wealth had ne'er enrich'd us. Agnes. [to the other Assassins going to bind Ellen.]
                                         Bind her not:
She scarce has pow'r to lift her hands in pray'r. Assas.
To her, to her she points. Ellen.
                                         Oh wound her not.
Here, here, good men, these stones, they say, are diamonds:
This had escap'd you—take it—spare her life.
'Twas once a nuptial present—so—farewell.                                          [Kissing the picture, which she gives the Assassin.
I fondly thought to have worn thee in the grave.
Spare but her life, and I shall die content.                                          [Swoons away. Agnes.
Hear me, unhappy men! and mark my words.
[100]   I am Tortona's Countess, and I come
To bear this sufferer, more than daughter to me,
To the lone vale below that gave her birth.
Let me pass on, and this last duty pay,
And, by yon heav'n! I vow,                                          [Gives a ring to one of the Assassins.
Whene'er you show this ring, I will redeem it
[Page 271]

With riches, that shall free your future days
From deeds of guilt. Assas. [looking upon Ellen.]
Her pulse is still—it beats not. Assas.
Let not this corse betray us. Plunge it, there,
Within yon snow-pit. Assas.
                                         Aye. I'll safely tomb her.
Give me the corse.                                          [One of the Assassins bears Ellen off. Agnes.
                                         Oh stay! she is not dead.
Restore her to my arms, I will repay you
With wealth, a monarch's ransom. Assas.
                                         Those will free
Thyself, or thou shalt join her. Agnes.
                                         Ye shall banquet
In golden halls, and o'er your tombs I'll raise
Convents, where holy men by force of pray'r,
Shall save your souls from fiends. Assas.
                                         You promise rarely, Alfonso [behind the scenes.]
Die wretch. Go—bear her to the convent. Agnes.
                                         Heav'n!
[125]   I hear the voice of succour. Man! unhand me.                                          [Struggling with them. Assas. [going to stab her.]
Nay—if you struggle, lady! you are dead.
[Page 272]
Alfonso rushes in, stabs one of the Assassins, in struggling with the other, who flies, he is himself wounded. Alf.
This to thy heart—fly, murderer—thou art free.                                          [to Agnes. Agnes.
Oh what words
Can rightly praise, what earthly gifts reward thee?
Thus, on thy hand, the Countess of Tortona
Prints the warm kiss of gratitude. Alf. [falls prostrate.]
                                         Oh—oh. Agnes.
Whence that deep groan? the assassin's steel has pierc'd him. Alf. [looking up.]
Not that—I felt it not. Strike—strike me dead. Agnes.
What—for this deed? Let it not grieve thy soul—
Long ages past, a voice from heav'n decreed,
“Who spills man's blood, by man his blood be spilt.”
Why art thou silent? Speak. Alf.
                                         But—but forgive me. Agnes.
In what hast thou offended? Alf. [to himself.]
                                         I must speak.
The threaten'd torments of the world to come,
Where sinners meet their doom, are center'd here. Agnes.
In what hast thou offended? Alf.
                                         I have left
The path where Virtue led me: I have strown
In the smooth vale of innocence and peace,
Rank baleful seed: and I have pluck'd its fruit
[Page 273]

That leaves a scar and blister on the soul,
[150]   When all of earth sinks to its native dust.
You know me now. Away— Agnes.
                                         I know none such. Alf.
But you do know my voice. Agnes.
                                         Lift up thy cowl:
Thy features may instruct me. Alf.
                                         Ask not that.
You'll turn away in horror. Agnes.
                                         If thy guilt
Aught touches me, this act of rescu'd life
Obliterates all trace of past offence.
Lift up thy cowl.                                          [He lifts it up reluctantly.
                                         Oh Heav'ns!—I know thee not.
Nay—go not hence. Alf.
                                         I would not shock thy soul—
[To himself.] I will not see her more. But—oh—her pardon!
I am (but do not gaze on me) I was,
In happier years, when Virtue led my steps,
Thy husband— Agnes. [she recollects him, and screams.]
Thou—my husband! Julian! Julian!
And yet—I knew thee not. Thou shalt not leave me.
My arms shall hold thee. Thou art more than pardon'd,
Husband! Alf.
                                         Oh sound once grateful to my soul.
But do not stain thy unpolluted lip.
[175]   Look, look not so.
[Page 274]
Agnes.
                                         I cannot view on earth
One so belov'd. Alf.
                                         Not with that eye of kindness.
I cannot look on thee: oh, if thine eye
Flash'd vengeful light'ning, I'd not turn away.
Thou shalt not hold me more. Agnes.
                                         Am I so hateful? Alf.
Next Heav'n, I honour thee, but ne'er shall saints
Stoop to a fiend's embrace. Why should'st thou weep?
I cannot shed a tear. Agnes. [embracing him.]
Weep in these arms:
And as I clasp thee to my heart, recall
Past years of bliss, and pray'rs once heard in Heav'n,
That in each other's arms, blessing and blest,
Our life at once might close, and one the tomb
Rais'd o'er us, join'd in death. Husband! sore woe
Has chas'd away the vision of delight,
That o'er the innocence of untried youth
Diffus'd th'enchanted day-dream: it hath pleas'd
The searcher of the heart, by misery's test,
To prove my soul, and, here, 'mid lonely wilds
Where none but Heav'n can witness, I invoke
His ministering host, again to grave the vow
That links my lot to thine. Come, on this bosom
[200]   Rest, and find peace once more. Alf.
                                         Peace! never, never.
'Tis Virtue's heritage. Agnes.
                                         It shall be thine.
[Page 275]
Alf.
The past—the past. Agnes.
                                         Oh be it with these tears
Eternally forgotten! Alf.
                                         I have born
Unmov'd the shock of horror, but thy kindness
Unmans me.
Agnes, I thought not to have known once more,
The blessing of such tears.                                          [He weeps. Agnes.
                                         Oh thou hast groan'd
In bitterness of spirit to the storm,
That smote thee, sweeping by on icy wings,
And none has listen'd to thy woe, no voice
Spake consolation. Where, alas! was Agnes?
Ah! haply whilst thou call'd'st in anguish on me,
I, far away, unconscious of thy woe,
Pour'd unavailing sorrow on the tomb,
That clos'd not o'er thy sufferings. Now behold me
Thus at thy side, more blest to stand the storm,
And sooth thy misery, than in thoughtless years,
When the gay partner of vain joy, alone
I glitter'd in thy sunshine. Alf.
[225]                                            Heav'n reward thee! Agnes.
Heav'n hath rewarded me: once more we meet.
Oh give me all thy grief, and I will steal
Each pang away, and lull thee to repose.
These arms, amid the wilderness, shall stretch
Soft shelter o'er thee, here thy brow be pillow'd:
And ever as thou wak'st, the eye of Agnes
Shall gladden thine: till in the gradual peace
[Page 276]

That gains upon thee, I shall taste, once more,
All bliss that earth can give. Alf. [falling on her neck.]
Thus let me thank thee—
No—no. [Starts back in horror.] Guilt, guilt is on me. Agnes.
                                         None o'er earth,
Pass without stain. Alf.
                                         No common guilt is mine. Agnes.
Bow not beneath despair! I woo thee not
To luxury, and light pleasures, and the dream
Of joy departed. No. But, hand in hand,
Now let us, in affliction doubly dear,
Right onward journeying thro' the vale of woe,
Soothe and support each other. Once again
Here have we met, and never, never more,
If virtue yet have force to sway the heart,
Shall earthly pow'r divide us. Alf.
                                         Oh thou know'st not—
[250]   I cannot tell it thee. Agnes.
                                         I know it all.
Oh thou art deeply wounded: drops of blood
Stream on the snow. Come—let thy wife support thee—
Lean on me, Julian. Let us to the convent.
Oh no—not there—not there. Alf.
                                         Support me not.
There was a time—let me depart, I pray thee,
While reason yet is mine. [more and more confused.] 'Tis not this wound.
'Tis in my head—my heart—the fiend that tends
[Page 277]

On evil deeds, is busy with my soul.
Angel of light! (thou art not of this earth)
Who, from the mansions of the blest, descend'st
On gracious errand to repentant sinners,
Canst thou not quell this demon? drive him hence!
I cannot long sustain this terrible coil? Agnes.
Father of mercy! calm his troubled spirit! Alf. [frantic.]
Woman! thou know'st me not. I know thee well—
Thou art Novara's daughter: the fair prize.
Gaily they came, brave gallants in their trim,
High-plum'd, and banners floating—the proud steeds
Caparison'd, career'd beneath thy throne.
Thou knew'st me then, when from the vanquish'd field
I bore the blushing bride—but—when he struck me—
Thou looking on, upon my nuptial day,
[275]   When the proud peasant struck me, at thy side,
Thou did'st forget me—hie thee to thy palace:
But there is one: and well I warn thee, lady!
One of low birth—look, if she flash before thee,
She claims me for her own. We meet no more. Agnes.
We part not, till death parts us. Alf.
                                         Am I thine?
I know not what I speak—if I have utter'd
Sounds grievous to thy soul, thy pardon, Agnes.
It will not be controll'd. Agnes.
                                         Oh be the past
Eternally forgotten! mark me, Julian—
Thy wounds require relief—recall thy mind.
[Page 278]

Is there amid these wilds a sheltering roof,
Save yonder convent? Alf.
                                         None—for miles around. Agnes.
Oh go not to the convent—yet thou diest
Here without succour—but there is a cause. Alf.
Oh! might I perish here! thus at thy feet,
Thy tears fast falling o'er me. Infirmier enters with other Monks. Inf.
                                         Haste! oh haste.
The hapless Ellen! Agnes.
                                         Name her not—I charge thee. Inf.
Thou must attend. For thee alone she grieves.
Her wilder'd fancy views thee pierc'd with wounds
[300]   Beneath the murderer's blade, speak comfort to her,
Ere her last breath in frantic horror pass. Alf.
Ellen! and raving—oh! it cannot be.
It is—it is—said'st thou not now? I heard thee.
I must not to the convent? by the love
Thou did'st profess, I do conjure thee, speak:
Is it that hapless one? I may once more
Gaze on her as she dies; and her pale lip
May breathe forgiveness o'er me. Agnes.
                                         Yes—'tis Ellen.
I found her, lone, and raving on thy tomb.
Gaze not above so wildly. Alf.
                                         'Tis complete.
The measure is complete. The wife has sooth'd her.
What brought thee hither? Agnes.
                                         Pity for her woe.
[Page 279]

Nay, more—
The word of Heav'n, that bids me not desert
The orphan and the helpless, nor abandon
To bitter scorn, one innocent of ill.
Alone my presence calms her troubled spirit:
It awes at once, and soothes her. I have hung
O'er her distemper'd dreams, and thro' the night
Bath'd with cool drop her lip of fire, and watch'd her,
As one who tends a daughter—but for me,
[325]   Dark brooding grief again had rous'd her soul
To frantic horror: but my voice has wean'd her
From earthly thoughts, and smooth'd her way to Heav'n,
And now ere life quite ceas'd— Alf.
                                         How! was she dying?
Thanks, gracious Heav'n! receive her to thy rest!
Soon will her misery cease—but thine, [to himself] poor wretch!
Was she so near her end? then I will see her.
Oh, say, say what brought thee to these wilds? Agnes.
                                         Be calm!
She wish'd once more to view her native vale,
And there to die in peace, and nameless lie
With those from whom she sprung. Alf.
                                         Alas! poor Ellen!
No other wish but that! [with fervor.] there shalt thou rest,
Where from the cradle to the grave, thy life
One blameless day, each tranquil as the last,
Had glided on unknown in lowly peace:
But I drew near, and like the tempter, stole
[Page 280]

On thy lone paradise—there shalt thou rest.                                          [rushing off.
Restrain me not— Agnes.
                     Hear—Julian— Inf.
                                         Stay, rash man!
Thy wound bleeds fast. Alas! you scarce have strength
To reach the convent walls. Alf. [in wrath.]
[350]                                            Oppose me not—
Ellen! no murderer's blade shall scare thee more.
Who shall delay thy passage? low he lies                                          [pointing to the Assassin.
Who turn'd thee from thy course. I, I will place thee
Beneath the sod, and in thy grave, find mine.                                          [rushes out.

END OF ACT THE FOURTH.

[Page 281]
ACT V. SCENE I. Convent Hall. Provost. Pro.
Thou saint in Heav'n!
Thou, who did'st lead Alfonso to these rocks,
Self-doom'd in just atonement for past guilt,
Look down on his affliction. Confessor enters. Con.
                                         Holy father!
These unexampled miseries o'erpow'r me:
Forgive these gushing tears. The hapless Julian! Pro.
Alas! how fares it with him? Con.
                                         As with one
Not long to live: deep was th'assassin's blow.
Faint with the loss of blood, long-time he lay
In death-like swoon: here human art avail'd:
But who can heal the anguish of the soul,
Save Heav'n that smites in mercy! Pro.
                                         Say, my brother,
Is he restor'd to reason,
Fitly prepar'd for that eternal state
That knows no change? Con.
                                         Yes, Heav'n has visited
The contrite man. In Agnes' arms he woke,
[Page 282]

Calm as from sleep: in fitter hour I'll tell
Their farewell interview: 'tis graven here. Pro.
Then grant, all-gracious Heav'n! his sole request!
Oh may poor Ellen's last forgiveness breathe
[25]   Peace to his parting spirit. Con.
                                         Who shall say
What may ensue, if ere they meet again?
Hence flow my tears. At Julian's earnest pray'r,
The virtuous Agnes hangs o'er Ellen's couch,
Watching the moment of returning reason,
That, haply, ere he breathes his last, the voice
Of pardon yet may sooth him. Pro.
                                         Grant it, Heav'n. Con.
I left him still'd in meek and holy sadness,
To bear that parting scene: but much I fear
For hapless Ellen.
Her mind may ne'er regain its peaceful mood.
Say, holy father! may they meet again?
Or will not anguish rouse their souls once more
To frantic agony? Pro.
                                         What Ellen's state? Con.
I cannot call it frenzy,
And yet she is not in her perfect mind.
'Tis no delirium, where the fever's rage
Boils in the blood, and on the throbbing brain,
Shapes images and scenes of spectred horror:
'Tis the mild error of the sense confus'd,
That plays on cheated fancy: for she seems,
All memory of later woe effac'd,
[Page 283]

[50]   Blissful as once ere bleak adversity
Had ruffled youth's smooth current. Pro.
                                         Such things pass
Man's narrow ken: Heav'n wills it. Con.
                                         Round her couch
She fashions those, who sadly minister,
To the gay partners of her innocent sports,
Poor peasant girls, who cull in spring fresh flow'rs
To wreath their brow, and mix the mirthful dance:
And oft she calls Tortona's dame, who prays
In silence o'er her, her own happy mother,
List'ning with fond attention to the tune
That late she taught her. Me, my mournful duties
Have long familiar made with death-bed woe:
And I have look'd on sinners when despair
Scowl'd, as their eye glar'd fixedly upon me:
But never have I witness'd such a scene;
It quite o'ercomes me: life and death in one
So strangely link'd, and all that's sweet and sad.
Yet—haply as we commune, holy father,
All may be chang'd, and horrid images
Usurp the mastery. Pro.
                                         Let us haste: our pray'rs
May chase the fiend that haunts the bed of death.                                          [Exeunt.

Scene the Second an Apartment in the Convent. Agnes, Ellen on a Couch, attendant Monks, &c. Agnes.
Hush! rouse her not. Ellen. [in a delirium.]
So—enter in, I pray you,
Strangers and all: it is but once a year
We thus make holiday. Not so—not so—
You trip it awkardly, and mar the measure.
The pipe's not out of tune, your step lacks ear.
Oh—I have scarcely breath at once to dance
And teach the motion.                                          [Ellen sinks exhausted. Provost and Confessor enter. Pro. [to Agnes.]
Is all quiet with her? Agnes.
No—but exhausted with the play of fancy,
She peaceful sleeps. Pro. [considering her.]
Quite breathless, or I err. Agnes.
She but reposes: pray you, rouse her not.
I dread what may ensue: a shock too sudden
In painful horrors may unlodge her spirit.
I have been us'd to these fantastic moods,
Long have I watch'd her, and by tender cares
Had smooth'd her passage to eternity:
But this sad day hath all undone. Oh peace!
Her eyes unclose, and bright their eager glare. Ellen.
Hark! 'twas the shepherd's pipe!
Away! away! haste—to the green hills fly.
I will no longer, while the dog-star flames,
[Page 285]

Doze in your sultry plains. The flat air lies
[25]   Here, here, like lead upon me: it weighs down
The soul's free wing. Haste, to the green hills, fly.
How daintily the cool breeze fans my brow,
Tangling my locks in many a mazy twine!
Climb o'er yon mountain's peak, that props up Heav'n:
Mind not that mass of snow: so—heave it off. Agnes.
Compose thyself: here, on my bosom rest. Ellen.
Speak low—speak very low—only in whispers—
You know not what it is. Stranger! that mass
Which rock-like beetles o'er you, is loose snow.
The mule-bell must not tinkle while it passes:
Its very echo bursts it.
                                         Hail, once more,
My native land! hail sweetest interchange
Of all that chiefly gladdens eye and ear,
Bright lakes, the pine-clad mount, and hill and dale!
Hark! 'twas the Alpine lark that upward trill'd:
Angels may hear it now: 'tis mute to earth:
And oh that sound, most sweet at distance heard,
The hidden waterfall, that in still moon-light
Makes pleasant music to light-tripping elves.
Thou peaceful hut! thou vine, that I have taught
To clasp the rock: and thou my summer bow'r,
Where underneath the green bough's canopy
I sat, nor wish'd for the eagle's stretch of wing,
[50]   That swept the upper world: oh never more
Will I away. On you my eye first glanc'd,
On you my dying look shall close in peace:
[Page 286]

And there the sod shall rise that hides poor Ellen.
Pray for me—oh, I die. Agnes.
                                         A cold dew stands
On her pale brow. I ne'er saw this before. Pro.
'Tis the fore-runner of approaching death. Sacristan enters. Sac. [to Agnes.]
Lady! Alfonso now at life's last close,
Thus speaks thro' me, that he doth feel assur'd
Of Heav'nly mercy, if the death-bed blessing
Of Ellen rest upon him. Canst thou ask it?
Ellen will not deny thee. Pro. [bending over Ellen.]
'Tis, I fear,
In vain—I trace—alas! no sign of life. Agnes. [kneels.]
Oh Heav'n! in mercy yet awhile keep back
The stroke of death, and to herself restore her:
That one last word may breathe o'er dying Julian,
Peace and forgiveness. Pro.
                                         Heav'n has heard thy voice:
The recompence of virtue shall not fail,
While God is judge above. Her pulse faint flutters.
Hark! that low sigh, Ellen. [recovering.]
I pray you, call me not
From Heav'n's eternal rest! where have I been?
[75]   Most lov'd, most honour'd lady! art thou near me?
Then I shall die in peace. But—where—where am I? Agnes.
Beneath the convent roof with holy men.
[Page 287]
Ellen. [gazing around her.]
Thanks, holy father: a poor peasant's child
Can give no more. For thee, thou Saint on earth!
I have a gift: it is the pictur'd form
Of him, who never for one base as I am,
Should have left thee, whom only angels equal.
Where is it? Agnes.
                                         You resign'd it, gentle Ellen,
To rescue me from death. Ellen.
                                         Then, take this kiss:
And—give me thine.                                          [They embrace. Agnes.
                                         Ellen—I have a wish,
A pray'r to thee. Ellen.
                                         Oh may my spirit pass
In granting it! Agnes.
                                         We soon shall part for ever. Ellen.
Not so. We meet in Heav'n. Agnes.
                                         But—there is one—
Poor Julian. Ellen.
                     What of him? Agnes.
                                         Will he be there?
How shall he stand at the appointed day
Before the judgment seat, if thy forgiveness
[100]   Rest not upon him? Ellen.
                                         Oh that now he heard me.
'Twere now no sin to gaze upon this face,
And hear the voice that pardons him. Agnes.
                                         And canst thou
Endure the meeting? will it not o'erpow'r thee?
He is beneath this roof. Will it not shock thee
Once more to view him? not, as once, alas,
[Page 288]

In pride of manhood, but a contrite sinner
Chastis'd by woe: and, such as now I view thee,
Nigh unto death? yet peace at last would sooth him,
Blest by thy pardon. Ellen.
                                         Heav'n has giv'n me strength.
If he can look on Ellen, hither lead him.
Say, Heav'n is merciful. I pray, delay not:
My breath begins to fail. Be not long absent.
Oh let me, on thy breast, in blessing thee
Breathe out my spirit! Agnes.
                                         Grant me strength, ye saints!                                          [Agnes goes out. Prior. [looking on Ellen.]
Her head reclines again. Sure, life has left her. Alfonso led in by Agnes , and supported by the Monks. Alf.
I pray you, mock me not. Is she not dead?
Lift me, and let me gaze upon her face.                                          [After long gazing on her.
How calm! e'en so as when I first beheld thee.
It speaks a soul that past in peace with all:
And if thy placid lip has utterance lost,
[125]   That look is like a blessing. Ellen.
                                         Agnes? Julian?
Where are you? Alf.
                     Prostrate at thy feet. Ellen.
                                         Oh, Julian,
In secret oft I pray'd
That thou might'st hear my blessing: Heav'n is gracious.
[Page 289]

Give me thy hand: I cannot see thy face,
My eyes grow dim: thy honour'd hand, thou saint!
Thus I unite you. [joining their hands.] Heav'n has heard my pray'r.
Now—Julian, thou art blest. We meet in heav'n.                                          [Ellen dies. Julian.
Father of Mercy! thanks. Support me, Agnes!
Oh that I ne'er had wrong'd thee!                                          [Julian dies. Agnes.
                                         Julian—hear me—
His hand now quits my grasp. Farewell! farewell.                                          [She kneels over them. Prior.
Rise, virtuous mourner, rise! celestial peace
Be thine! oh thou, who in severest trial,
Firm in thyself, and faultless, shed'st the tear
Lenient o'er human frailty! peace be thine!                                          [To the Monks bending over the dead bodies.
Brethren! o'er these the solemn requiem breathe!
Then, duly in our cemetery place
Till other burial claims: thou, [to Julian.] with thy sires,
In sculptur'd tombs: and thou, [to Ellen.] poor child, with thine,
Nameless beneath the grass-sod.
                                         Soon will pass
[150]   Your mortal frames from sight: but long your fate
Shall call down tears from many a stranger guest.
Oft shall they sigh o'er thee, poor peasant girl!
Whose earthly woes, unmerited, await
Heav'n's blissful recompense. For thee, Alfonso!
[Page 290]

By thy example, warn the man of guilt,
That Heav'n, who purified thy soul by woe,
And chasten'd with sore wounds, may summon him,
Flush'd from the banquet where sin ranks the guests,
At once before the presence of his God. Back matter

[Page ]
Main text ACT I. SCENE I. The exterior of the Fort, on the margin of the Neva, Behind, the Castle and Towers of Schlusselburgh. Mirovitz enters. Miro.
'Tis now the morning-watch—from tow'r to tow'r
Hark! round yon fort's wide circuit, loudly rings
The voice of challeng'd sentinels. The time,
Th'appointed hour is past. Methinks, I hear
Advancing steps.—'Twas but the Neva's flood
That round this isle, the abode of woe and horror,
Whirls its swift eddies. Feodor enters.
                                         Feodor—my brother.
Speak—Feodor? Feo.
                     The same. Miro.
                                         Why this delay?
[Page 82]
Feo.
'Tis ever thus—thy fervent spirit outruns
Th'appointed time. Miro.
                                         Speed! speed, ye hours of vengeance!
Oh that night's thickest clouds were gather'd round me!
Till then where hide my deep disgrace? Feo.
                                         Be patient. Miro.
Say, was it slight th'offence, that here, so long,
In these drear haunts, doom'd for my sire's misdeeds,
I still have serv'd inglorious? wrong on wrong—
Insult on insult! nay—'tis known to all,
That when the ruthless minion, proud Rimuni,
Had of his honour'd charge depriv'd Naritzin,
On me by right and ordinance of service,
[25]   Devolved the care of Ivan. Vain my claims.
Galinovitz, it seems, has won their favour;
A stripling, in his boy-hood, o'er my brow
Rais'd as in mockery. Be swift vengeance mine!
Deep, deadly as their outrage. Feo.
                                         Mirovitz,
'Tis in thy power. The guard who serve the night-watch,
Now, at my word assembled, wait thy bidding,
In secret, in the cavern, delv'd beneath
The western bastion, whose huge bulk drives back
The wint'ry floods. But not on them alone
Our hope is fix'd: all whom this isle contains,
At thy first summons will arise in arms
To free Naritzin. Such his kindly rule,
That when the herald's voice aloud proclaim'd
[Page 83]

That here the Empress and Rimuni meet
This day to seal his doom, the cry of wrath,
Of vengeance, and revolt, rang round the isle.
Go forth—and head the tumult. Miro.
                                         Feodor,
The rage and uproar of the populace
Burst like the tide, whose refluent waves, ere long,
Die off unheard: not such my course of vengeance.
Its progress like the Neva's ceaseless stream,
That gathering up its strength from thousand rills
[50]   Sweeps onward, without ebb, and undermines
The tower whose shadow slumbers on its bosom
In proud security. My art shall gain
To serve my deep revenge, all who this night
Hold watch and ward o'er Ivan. Feo.
                                         Speed, and prosper.                                          [Exeunt. Scene the Second. A Cavern outside the Ramparts. Conspirators. Con.
He comes not. Hence. Con.
                                         Stay, comrades! wherefore dread
In Mirovitz, delay? you, who so oft
Witness'd his valour, first to mount the breach,
Or singly scale the fortress? Con.
                                         Hark, some step
Approaches. Comrades! on your guard: be watchful!
Nearer it hastens: on your guard, I say—
Now boldly challenge.                                          [They draw their swords.
[Page 84]
Mirovitz and Feodor enter. Con.
                                         Friend or foe? advance not. Feo.
'Tis Mirovitz. Miro.
                                         Put up your swords, brave comrades!
Say, are all present? Theodore, I see,
Norkots, and Ostralof, and brave Nagotzin.
I greet thee, bold Truwarotz, Sulskoi, too,
And Voronetz, who never fled from man. Feo.
Behold them, brave, determin'd; speak thy will. Miro.
My will! not so: 'tis loyalty, 'tis honour
Points out their path. Comrades, the prisoner, Ivan,
Is Russia's rightful Emperor. 'Tis your king
Claims vengeance. By his wrongs, his woes, I urge you:
Recall to mind, the day which hail'd him monarch,
Saw him a helpless prisoner; call to mind,
How, on from fort to fort, they dragg'd their victim,
[25]   Ere to this spot accurst, this last abode
Of horror and despair, Rimuni doom'd him
As one entomb'd alive, in yon drear cell
To moulder limb by limb. No beam of day
Ere glimmers on the cell that hears his groan:
And, till renown'd Naritzin here held charge,
'Tis known to all—the fierce barbarians tortur'd
His tender limbs. The sentinels on watch,
Tho' us'd to blood and groans of horrid death,
Have quak'd to hear his night-shriek. Con.
                                         We will free him.
Fix thou the hour.
[Page 85]
Miro.
                                         First, yield me patient hearing.
You all revere Naritzin. Con.
                                         Yes—as children
Honour a father. Miro.
                                         You would shed your blood
To rescue him from wrong. Con.
                                         Most willingly. Miro.
Naritzin cannot brook such deep disgrace.
Thus wrong'd by her. Her—on whose brow his hand
Once fix'd the crown! if fam'd Naritzin join us,
The realm would rise in arms. Con.
                                         Lead to Naritzin— Miro. [stopping him.]
Yet stay.
[50]   Say, brave associates, if the lord Naritzin
Decline our proffer'd aid, are all resolv'd
To free their sov'reign? Con.
                                         We will rescue Ivan,
Or bravely perish. On— Miro.
                                         Yet—ere we speed,
Pledge we a soldier's faith, a soldier's honour,
That in this cave, ere night-fall, once again
We meet, to fix the hour, and give to each
Fit charge and separate station. Cons.
                                         Yes—ere night-fall,
Here we will meet. To thee we freely pledge
A soldier's honour. Lead us forth. Miro.
                                         Brave comrades,
I lead where glory summons: fearless follow.                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 86]
Scene the Third. A rocky shore on the margin of the Lake, overlooked by a Bastion of the Fort. Narshkoff and his two Sons enter, and spread a Net on the Rocks. Son. [to his brother.]
Cheer you, my brother: here awhile take rest:
You are o'er-tir'd: here in the sun repose. Narsh.
Give me the net, and I will spread it out,
And on the smooth rock dry its dripping meshes:
So, if perchance some soldier cross our way,
We shall not breed suspicion, but may seem
Intent on our day labour.                                          [He looks round earnestly. Son.
                                         Tell me, father,
Why do you seem disturb'd? what care comes o'er you?
Why point to yon dark nook? Narsh.
                                         We have o'er-shot it.
Look, my brave boys, our tough oars have o'er-shot
The little creek—'Tis there, beneath that rock,
Where yon huge birch bow'd down by weight of years
Hangs o'er the Neva. Son.
                                         'Tis a cheerless spot,
Gloomy as night— Narsh.
                                         That was th'appointed place;
There we must anchor our light skiff, and wait
[Page 87]

The signal—When, at night, the torch thrice waves
On yon tall eastern turret—look— Son.
                                         I note it— Narsh.
At the third signal, at a moment's warning
All must be ready: we must hoist the sail
[25]   If fair the breeze: if foul, brave boys, your sinews
Must not refuse to labour at the oar,
Till our good vessel o'er Ladoga's lake
Has safely wafted the entrusted charge—
It was no trifling bribe— Son.
                                         Our life's at hazard— Narsh.
So is it, every day, when we do tempt
The wave, and cast our meshes in the flood.
Look you, so we but reach yon shore in safety
The rest of life we may carouse at will.
Take up the net—push off the boat—away— Son.
My brother is o'er-tir'd; a little moment,
A moment rest. And, tell us, I entreat you,
Whom we must land in safety on yon shore? Narsh.
I know not: but, no doubt, some high-born prisoner
Who has escap'd from chains. Son.
                                         Oh! were it Ivan,
This hand should from my arm first drop in the wave
Ere it let loose the oar. That hapless youth!
I know not why it is, whene'er I hear
His story, tho' it sorely grieve my heart,
Yet doth it chain mine ear. Narsh.
                                         'Tis ever so
When miseries unprovok'd command our pity.
[Page 88]

In sooth his woe would melt a heart of stone.
[50]   Ivan is rightful emperor: he was crown'd
King in his cradle— Son.
                                         Out—alas the day!
It had been better, father, had poor Ivan
Our brother been, and born like us to labour.
Then—he had scap'd those torturers. Narsh.
                                         Would that Ivan
Had perish'd with the monk who lur'd him forth,
Ere to yon hideous cave the ruffians dragg'd him!
'Tis now, eight years gone by, and Ivan then
Scarce ten years old—'Twas a bleak eve, and loudly
The Neva roar'd: I never shall forget it.
Just as I moor'd my boat yon side the flood,
A band of soldiers hail'd me: loud their voice,
And fiercely, as in wrath, their swords unsheath'd
Wav'd o'er their prisoners. 'Twas a piteous sight,
And all was strife and tumult. I full fain
Had fled the spot, when one, with whose stern voice
I dar'd not parley, bad me to this isle
Ferry the prisoners, Ivan, and the monk,
Each bound in chains— Son.
                                         The boy, their king, in chains! Narsh.
Sore manacled. The child sunk down oe'rpower'd,
Mute, motionless, save ever and anon
A big tear trickled, and a deep sigh burst
[75]   As it would break his heart. Not so the monk:
I heard his thrilling outcry, as he writh'd
And struggled with his chains, and with clench'd fist
In frantic rage oft struck his hoary temples.
[Page 89]

And as I reach'd the fort, just as my oar
Spent its last stroke, the monk, uprising, dash'd
From either side the guard that closely grasp'd him,
Then plung'd into the flood with all his weight
Of fetters.—Never man beheld him more:
Save, yearly, on that day, that very hour
He perish'd, some have seen— Son.
                                         Seen what? Say, father— Narsh.
His very self, that monk, so manacled,
Rise from the flood, and point with threat'ning hand
To Ivan's tow'r. But, hush! the air has ears,
And the whole isle is vex'd with vigilant spies.                                          [Ortosk, a Sentinel, appears on the bastion.
Come, let us hence— Ort.
                     Speak— Son.
                                         'Tis the sentinel! Ort.
I charge you, on your lives, say, wherefore here?
Why, on this spot? Narsh.
                                         We are poor fishermen
Who in these waters seek by daily labour
Our hard-earn'd food. We were o'er-tir'd, good soldier,
And came to dry our nets, and rest awhile
[100]   On this smooth beach. Ort.
                                         Away, nor loiter here.
If, when I challenge next, you here are found,
You are for life imprison'd.                                          [Sentinel goes. Narsh.
                                         Come, my boys!
'Tis dangerous tarrying here.
[Page 90]
Son.
                                         Oh grant, kind heav'n,
That this stout oar may bear poor Ivan hence,
And I will prize it as a monarch's sceptre.                                          [Exeunt. Scene the Fourth. Naritzin's Castle. Naritzin. Narit.
Wrong'd by Elizabeth! thy offspring! thine,
Thou father of thy country!
Her, on whose brow this hand the diadem fix'd
Reft from the hapless Ivan! Judge of earth!
And must Naritzin's conscious lip confess
'Tis righteous retribution? Must I own
In bitterness of self-accusing misery
Th'eternal truth, “One deed unhallow'd teems
With woe engend'ring woe?” What now awaits me?
Death, or drear exile, where Siberia's snows
Shall sepulchre my bones. Oh! were it mine
Alone to suffer! But, thou ill-starr'd Ivan!
To leave thee thus expos'd! And thou, most lov'd
Petrowna, whose pure spirit did prefer
To pomp and courts, this residence of horror,
To share my doom; ah! 'tis thy secret grief
That festers in this bosom. Righteous heav'n
Heap on this head thy fury! Spare Petrowna!
Oh shield the innnocent Ivan!
[Page 91]
Galvez enters.
                                         Galvez here!
Why thus uncall'd?                                          [A shout heard. Gal.
                                         My lord, and honour'd master,
Hark to the voice that loudly calls on you,
None, none shall injure you. Voices without.
[25]   No pow'r on earth
Shall wrong the good Naritzin. Petrowna enters. Narit.
                                         Ha! Petrowna!
I pray thee, love, retire.
                                         [to Galvez.] Say, whence this tumult? Gal.
All whom this isle contains, th'indignant soldiers
Are risen to rescue you. Pet.
                                         'Tis known to all,
That here, the woman thy pow'r exalted,
She who has basely wrong'd thee, and her minion,
The insolent Rimuni, meet this day
To seal thy condemnation.
                                         [Voices without.] Comrades! on—
Our swords shall guard Naritzin. Narit. [to Galvez.]
                                         Go, control
Their fury. Gal.
                                         'Tis in vain. Their rage enflam'd,
If you deny them audience, will burst forth
In maddening insurrection. Pet.
                                         Good, my lord,
Admit them to thy presence. Thou hast ever
[Page 92]

Heard, and redrest their grievance. I beseech thee,
Vouchsafe them gracious hearing. Narit. [to Galvez.]
                                         Give them entrance.                                          [Galvez goes.
Yes, I will curb this tumult. Aid me, heav'n!
[50]   Make firm my mind, that I may yet withstand
This dread temptation! Mirovitz and Soldiers enter.
                                         Wherefore here? Why, soldiers,
This tumult? Who has injur'd you? Miro.
                                         My lord,
You they have injur'd, basely wrong'd you.—Hear us:
Your rule has ever been most merciful:
Your kindness and humanity have sooth'd
Th'abode of horror: and while yet our hands
Hold strength to wield a soldier's weapon, none
Shall force you from this isle. Narit.
                                         Say, what thy purpose? Miro.
To rescue you from violence and wrong. Narit.
Thou, rescue me! Whence thy authority? Miro.
High heav'n, who wills not that the guiltless suffer:
The soul's resistless impulse to abase
Tyrannic pow'r. Narit.
                                         Proud words but ill conceal
Disloyal deeds. Soldiers, obey: depart
Ere death repress your daring. Hence—
[Page 93]
Sol.
                                         Speak, Mirovitz:
This is a righteous cause. Miro.
                                         You see these veterans,
Men like myself, grey-headed, worn with service.
You know their gallant deeds. Narit.
[75]                                            Yes, oft have witness'd.
There's not a breast of those who now surround me
Undinted by brave wounds. Miro.
                                         Shall then the chief
Who marshall'd us to conquest, fall a victim
To base suspicion? No: their brave right hands
Each on his sword, are pledg'd. Speak but the word,
The cannon levell'd to announce the arrival
Of those weak tyrants, 'neath Ladoga's water
Shall plunge in all its bravery their galley
Ere it insult the fort. Narit.
                                         I'll hear no more.
I am unarm'd, or I had plung'd my sword,
Bold rebel! in thy heart. Hence— Pet.
                                         Thy disgrace,
Thy wrongs inflame their souls. Miro.
                                         At will command us:
Naritzin's word needs not a sovereign's sanction. Narit.
If then Naritzin's word has pow'r, obey it.
Soldiers, your zeal betrays you. What your purpose?
To shield Naritzin from the iron grasp
Of merciless oppression? How? By deeds
Whose guilt and dire enormities outswell
[Page 94]

The vile traducer's malice: deeds that cast
Round spotless loyalty the blood-stain'd garb
[100]   Of treason and rebellion. Here, first plunge
Your weapons, ere a mutinous arm be rais'd
To strike th'anointed brow. Revere your sov'reign!
Each to his home, in peace, and from Naritzin
Learn to submit.                                          [Soldiers depart. Miro. [in going.]
My lord, in time of peril
Here claim redress. [Laying his hand on his sword.                                          [Exit. Pet. [advancing solemnly.]
And did I rightly hear thee?
Submit! And didst thou speak it? Thine, that word! Narit.
None but myself shall vindicate my honour. Pet.
What thy resolve? Narit.
                                         I will confront the accuser,
And shame the slanderous tongue. Pet.
                                         Why rush on death?
Hear me pour forth my inmost soul, and plead
For one in hopeless anguish, one by all
Abandon'd: one, on whom no sun by day,
Nor moon nor star by night, has sent its beam:
Who for the freshness of the vital air,
Drinks foul contagion, and for human utterance,
Hears but the echo rendering back his groan,
Or pestential damps, that drop by drop
Burst on his flinty bed. I plead for Ivan.
Thou did'st permit it, in the cell unseen
Of human eye, I still'd his frantic shriek,
[125]   The while he knew not whose the voice that sooth'd him.
[Page 95]

I taught him to adore the awful pow'r
Whose chastisement is love: and, year by year
Matur'd his virtues, and beheld the flow'r
That cruel hands once crush'd, expanding fair
Beneath my tendance. Who shall tend him now?
The ruthless torturers? Narit.
                                         You wound my soul. Pet.
Is mine at peace? Oh grant my pray'r. Free Ivan:
And fix him—for thou can'st—thy word has pow'r,
King on his father's throne. Narit.
                                         I crown'd Elizabeth,
The offspring of my lord and much-lov'd master,
The father of his country. I enthron'd her,
Urge me no more. Pet.
                                         Be witness, earth and heav'n!
Witness thyself! while on thy sacred word
Her throne in proud security repos'd,
Tho' my heart inly glow'd, my lip was silent.
Forbearance now is base servility,
Dishonouring our nature. Thou did'st crown her:
What thy reward? Rimuni's word shall answer.
Hear, and avenge! To thee, an injur'd nation
Lifts up her voice: not this abode of horror
That calls down light'ning from indignant heav'n,
[150]   But, at thy word, a realm would rise in arms,
And crush the usurper. Narit.
                                         Oh that heav'n's wing'd fires
Had pierc'd my brow, or ere I had dethron'd
The unoffending child!
[Page 96]
Pet.
                                         Restore him. Free
From anguish and remorse thy troubled spirit. Narit.
Hence—lest I do a deed whose mere suggestion
Rives me with horror.                                          [Cannon and shouts heard.]
                                         Heard you not that sound,
Those shouts—that roar of cannon? 'Tis— Pet. [interrupting him.]
                                         Th'usurper. Narit. [shouts and cannon repeated.]
Again— Pet.
                                         That sound announces her arrival
This side the Neva. Narit.
                                         Now awhile, Petrowna,
Farewell. I must prepare and arm my spirit, Pet. [interrupting him.]
For insult, for oppression, for dire injuries
That mock the utterance. Hear my farewell word:
We may not meet again. Thou art the temple
Where honour dwelt enshrin'd, and shall thy knee
Bend at Rimuni's beck? and must Petrowna,
(Spare, spare me that disgrace!) look tamely on
And see her lord lift vainly up the hand
That crown'd and uncrown'd kings, to that base minion
[175]   A suppliant for pity? Narit.
                                         Never—never.
Bend to Rimuni? Lift to him this hand!
Rather its strength shall o'er yon rampart wave
War's crimson standard and array the realm
In Ivan's cause. My pow'r shall yet prevail:
Thro' me the voice of truth shall reach the throne,
And silence the oppressor. I this day
[Page 97]

Will lighten Ivan's doom: yon sun, this day
Shall see Naritzin or Rimuni perish.
Awhile farewell. Pet.
                                         Whate'er thy doom, is mine:
Bonds, exile, death. Go thou where honour calls:
Th'oppressor shall not triumph. Ivan! reign!

[Page 98]
ACT II. SCENE I. The outward Fort. Galinovitz, Mirovitz, Feodor , Soldiers under arms to receive the Empress. Galin. [to Mirovitz.]
The herald is arrived. Here will the Empress
A few fleet hours remain. Ere day-light dies
All speed away, and in new pomps and pleasures
Blot out the memory of these scenes of horror. Miro. [aside]
Oh that the Neva in its roaring waters
Would their proud bark ingulph!                                          [Sound of trumpets. Galin. [looking out.]
Behold, they come—
Gay as in festal pomp. The sun-beams gild
Their streamers, now bright-waving in the wind,
Now, as the light breeze falls, kissing in sport
The Neva's dimpled wave. Miro. [aside.]
                                         Insulting pomp!
That flares portentous on these drear abodes,
Like some strange meteor that with transient glare,
Appalls mankind. [Flourish of trumpets.] Yon trumpets' ceaseless clamour
Proclaims their entry. [Looking out.] Ha! Rimuni leads her:
[Page 99]

Look, how she leans on his proud arm, and smiles
Delighted with his flattery. The Empress, Rimuni, Senators, Guards, Heralds , enter in state. Sold. [kneeling.]
                                         Hail! long live
Elizabeth, our gracious sov'reign! Emp.
                                         Rise—
I thank your love, and will reward your zeal. Rim. [presenting Galinovitz.]
Galinovitz, now warden of yon fortress,
More faithful than Naritzin, kneels before you.
[25]   Deign to vouchsafe him audience! Galin. [laying at her feet various keys.]
Gracious Empress!
These at your feet I lay. This guards the gate
That bars the outward fortress: this secures
All that the inward moat encircles: this
The citadel: these close the prisoner's cells:
This, from the eye of man and light of heav'n,
Hides Ivan. Rim.
                     Lives he yet? Galin.
                                         Yet Ivan breathes. Rim. [aside.]
Would he were dead! Emp. [to Galinovitz.]
Sir, till our further will
Resume thy charge. Miro. [aside to Feodor.]
We must avoid suspicion.
With seeming reverence we will kneel before her.                                          [They kneel to the Empress. Emp.
Your suit—your names.
[Page 100]
Rim. [advancing, interrupts them.]
Ungrateful to your ear.
This, Mirovitz, that, Feodor, his brother,
Their ancestors of old were fam'd for pow'r
And loyalty: but their rebellious father
Serv'd with Mazeppa, when that faithless chief
Leagu'd with our foes against your godlike sire.
The weight of his rebellion crush'd himself
And all his race. Miro.
                                         We long in arms have serv'd you,
[50]   And shed our youthful blood in tented fields,
Following your standard. Rim.
                                         Vaunt not thus your duty. Emp.
Merit by loyal deeds our further favour. Miro.
We are your slaves                                          [Shouts heard at Naritzin's approach. Rim. [aside.]
The proud Naritzin comes. Naritzin enters, followed by Petrowna closely veiled. Sold. [kneeling to the Empress.]
Look down with eye of favour on Naritzin. Rim.
Peace! nor insult the royal presence. Narit. [kneeling respectfully to the Empress.]
                                         Justice. Rim.
It shall not be delay'd. Narit.
                                         My lord Rimuni,
Not unto you, Naritzin deigns appeal.
Justice, my gracious mistress! Emp.
                                         Sir, it grieves me
[Page 101]

To see thee thus, here in the face of day
A man accus'd, before the public eye
Disgrac'd. I leant on thee, my lord Naritzin,
As on the prop and column of my empire. Narit.
If ere my zeal; I may not add my actions,
Your favour won, now in the public presence
Declare my crime. Rim.
                                         Before the senate answer:
There hear thy condemnation. Pet. [aside to Naritzin.]
Condemnation!
Be firm—farewell.                                          [Petrowna goes. Narit.
[75]                                            Hear, Empress! on his death-bed
Your sire, my much-lov'd master, charg'd Naritzin
By many a wound, when, side by side, our swords
Bore conquest on their edge, that long as life
Yet linger'd in these veins, I should uphold
The glory of his empire, nor desert
His royal offspring. Have I disobey'd
My sov'reign's charge? Let this distinguish'd proof,
Your gift, make answer. [A diamond cross.] With this high reward,
When on your brow I fix'd the diadem,
You deign'd to honour me. Suspicion's breath
Must not with venemous taint pollute the breast
Grac'd by a monarch's favour. At your word
This hand resign'd my sword: a monarch's present.
Take back your gift, and grant Naritzin's pray'r,
Vouchsafe me one request, the plain demand
Of justice. Emp.
Speak. Narit.
                                         That you, my gracious mistress,
[Page 102]

Would deign your presence when Naritzin pleads
Before th'assembled senate. Rim.
                                         Proud Naritzin!
Mine is the grateful task to free the sov'reign
From toils and cares of state: and I am charg'd
To search out your misdeeds. Narit.
[100]                                            I shall divulge
Truths bitter to thy soul, thou man of guilt. Emp.
Proclaim them—freely speak: thy sov'reign bids thee. Narit.
The image of my lord, and gracious master,
The father of his country, lives in you.
I may not here proclaim them. In your presence,
Before the senate, at their secret council,
All shall be fully told. Emp.
                                         There, we will hear thee.
On to the council. There, my lord Naritzin,
If guiltless, at my throne, before my presence
Stand unappall'd. Thy sov'reign is thy judge.                                          [Exeunt omnes. Scene changes to Ivan's Prison, faintly illumed with one central lamp. Petrowna enters with a lamp, and basket of provisions. Ivan asleep. Pet.
Forgive my long delay!
Ivan—oh answer me. He hears me not,
Or, at the breath, the whisper of my word,
His voice had giv'n kind welcome— [looking on him.] Deep his slumber:
[Page 103]

Yet, at this hour, such sleep is no repose
That gently recreates nature.
                                         Gracious heav'n!
How will his misery end? will once again
Thy beam, oh blessed sun, illume his brow?
Will he, in kindly fellowship with man,
Feel what the god of kindness has infus'd
In human hearts, responsive to the voice
Of sympathy: or must this cell for ever
[125]   Close on his unavenged wrongs? Ivan. [asleep.]
                                         Petrowna!
Delay not. Pet.
                                         I am with thee—at thy side—
A deep and heavy slumber weighs him down.
Hark! in a vision, in some troublous dream
His voice did call on me. Again: 'tis hush'd
In silence and forgetfulness of woe.
Not so with me. Can voice of mortal utter
What this day may bring forth? 'Tis horror, all,
And dread suspense. Sleep on, and wake no more!
Thou, whose harsh doom of unexampled woe,
Whose very weakness and infirmity
Have link'd thee to my soul. Oh hapless Ivan!
How shall I arm my tongue, how frame my words,
How tell thee, that, this day th'usurper comes
Haply to question thee, and doom to exile
My honour'd lord, Naritzin? How prepare thee
(If but Naritzin aid the general voice)
For freedom, sov'reign'ty, or—torturing death?
[Page 104]

Thou! whose high will man's errant thought o'errules,
Guide me aright! Ivan. [asleep.]
No: they will trace our foot-steps.
Avoid me. Look, how slow yon monk steals on.
Fie on thee! Shame! A lye on holy lips!
[150]   Ha! gone. The swoln wave circles o'er his head:
They cannot torture him. Pet.
                                         His frame, methinks,
High-labours, and his features, e'en in slumber,
Have lost their winning mildness. Ivan, wake. Ivan. [asleep.]
I cannot bear those instruments of torture.
All, I confess it all. The monk seduc'd me.
Oh mercy, mercy, heav'n? Pet.
                                         Ivan! wake. Ivan. [confused.]
Ha! Is it thou, Petrowna: none but thou? Pet.
There is none else. Ivan.
                                         I pray you, turn your lamp
There, steadily. No ray of light there gleams.
It may be lurking there. Pet.
                                         'Twas but a dream:
I heard thee, in thy sleep; forget it all.
Here is thy food, and I may yet remain
Some little time. Ivan.
                                         Oh, ever kind, most welcome!
The visionary shapes that vex'd my slumber,
Have in thy presence vanish'd all: not so
This horror at my heart: unwonted gloom
[Page 105]

Here presses like reality. Petrowna,
May I disclose it to thee? It would sooth,
Methinks, my woe, yet—it will pain thy bosom.
[175]   The sufferings I endure weigh heavy on thee.
How shall I thank thee? Pet.
                                         Give me all thy woe,
So thank Petrowna. Ivan. [alarmed.]
Does not that lamp pass wavering by thee? Pet.
                                         Ivan! Ivan. [motioning with his hand.]
So it past wavering by me. Oh, Petrowna,
It was no shadow, no unreal phantom,
Such as oft haunt my troubled sleep—I saw it
Distinctly, as now flaming there—last night,
(The day and night to me, alas, are one,
One ceaseless misery:) at the stroke of midnight,
As on my couch I laid me down, that lamp
Past on before me, wavering, as borne
By some invisible arm. Behind it stalk'd
With pond'rous tread, a form of giant stature.
I could not trace its features. In its hand
A poniard gleam'd: and, ever and anon,
A shroud that reek'd with blood-drops, floated round it.
On me, the murderer sprung: yet, yet I hear
His hideous yell: I feel his iron grasp.
But—ere the blade descended, while I writh'd
Beneath th'o'erpow'ring fiend, thou camest— Pet. [interrupting.]
                                         I! Ivan.
Such as I see thee now, with seraph brightness
[Page 106]

[200]   Illumining the gloom, and beaming on me
Rays of celestial pity. Say, Petrowna,
Wert thou thyself then near me? Pet.
                                         No—my son:
Heed not these shadowy dreams. Ivan.
                                         Not so, Petrowna,
For thrice I laid me down, and thrice the lamp
Past on, and ever more that form gigantic
Thro' all that long, long night, before me tow'r'd.
And, when worn out with misery, at late hour
I sank in slumber on my flinty couch,
Strange visions of past sufferings in my dreams
Confus'dly mingled. Pet.
                     Then I woke thee. Ivan.
                                         Yes,
Most kindly: and all vanish'd at thy presence,
Save this strange gloom, this horror at my heart—
Give me thy hand. Pet.
                                         Thy fever'd hand is fire:
And now the chill fit shakes thee. Ivan.
                                         Raise me up—
My limbs sink under me.
Support me. [Looking earnestly on her.] Ha! Petrowna! on thy eye-lid
The tear-drop trembles: why, why turn away?
Sure more than wonted gloom fills all the cell,
[225]   Or, if I rightly see, unwonted paleness
Has blanch'd thy cheek. Do not conceal aught from me.
All I can bear, all suffer, save the pang
That preys on thee in secret.
[Page 107]
Pet.
                                         'Tis for thee
Alone I feel, feel all a mother's woe.
Oh, Ivan! calm thy soul: call heav'n to aid thee.
The tongue of slander has traduc'd Naritzin:
Rimuni has accus'd him: and Galinovitz
O'er thee holds charge; my urgent pray'r has mov'd him.
I know his secret soul, it honours thee—
Ivan, be calm. This day, to these sad haunts,
The minion—base Rimuni, and—the Empress— Ivan. [interrupting her.]
Th'usurper! the fell fiend, who wears my crown? Pet.
Awhile forego these thoughts: no pow'r can save thee,
If such rash words reach other ear than mine.
This day, the Empress comes to doom—I fear—
My lord to exile—and—it may be—Ivan—
We ne'er shall meet again. Ivan.
                                         Ye light'nings, strike her! Pet.
Oh give me patient hearing! It may please
The sov'reign in her pride to look on thee— Ivan. [interrupting.]
Oh never will her stern eye look again
On Ivan living. Pet.
                                         Yet—if such her will,
[250]   Be mild, be gentle, then the menacing storm
May pass away unfelt. Ivan.
                                         I will obey thee.
Would that I ne'er again might see that fiend!
No—let me but behold her, but in day-light
Stand up, and front to front, pour in her heart
[Page 108]

The gather'd fire that inwardly consumes me:
Then—die. Her gaze of insult shall not rest
Triumphantly on Ivan. Pet.
                                         I implore thee,
I urge thee, Ivan, by Petrowna's love,
By years of unremitted tenderness,
I do entreat thee by these tears that gush
Like life-drops from my heart— Ivan. [interrupting.]
                                         Say, what thy wish? Pet.
That thou in presence of Elizabeth,
Suppress thy indignation. Ivan.
                                         In her presence
Conceal my just abhorrence! urge it not:
I would not disobey thee. Pet.
                                         Else, at once
Must perish all Petrowna's high-rais'd hopes. Ivan.
Oh! I will kneel before her: sue for pity.
Say, what thy hopes? Pet.
                                         To 'stablish thee once more,
[275]   King on thy father's throne. Ivan.
                                         Can'st thou deceive me? Pet.
Revolt rings round the isle. Where'er I past
Before me burst the shout that bad Naritzin
Raise thee to empire. While the weak usurper
Leant on Naritzin's sacred word, my soul
Supprest its ardour—but—Naritzin wrong'd,
Hope, that long slumber'd, like a giant springs
Fresh from repose, and urges on to action.
The glorious vision fires me: ne'er till now
Has bold imagination dar'd to shape
The righteous enterprize, that still deferr'd,
[Page 109]

Transfixt my heart with agony, and bath'd
In secret tears my pillow. On Naritzin
All now depends: and if my voice—my pray'r—
If ere Petrowna's tears had pow'r to move him,
Thy hand shall wield the sceptre. Ivan. [with dignity.]
                                         'Tis my birthright. Pet.
Rule thou the empire, in thy might extend
A hallow'd sceptre o'er a willing realm,
And fix the column of a nation's strength,
A nation's glory, on the immoveable base
Of private virtue: be, in blessing, blest:
So rightly execute the awful trust
Of heav'n's anointed. Ivan.
[300]                                            And—oh bliss of bliss!
To be the minister of grace and mercy,
To lighten the sad load of human woe,
To rescue the oppressed, to search out
The world-abandon'd orphan, and the mourner
Who sighs in secret—and, then say, “Come forth!
“View, in your king, a father”—This, Petrowna,
Is to be God on earth. Pet.
                                         Oh King of Kings,
Who in the soul of Ivan hast infus'd
A portion of thy spirit, guard from wrong
His sacred life!
                                         [To Ivan.] Have confidence in Heaven.
I may not longer here remain unblam'd.
Farewell! forget me not: before th'usurper,
Remember thou thy promise: in her presence
Be gentle, be submissive.
[Page 110]
Ivan.
                                         'Tis thy bidding,
I will bow down before her. Pet.
                                         Now—farewell— Ivan.
My mother— Pet.
                                         My beloved son, farewell!                                          [Exit.

END OF ACT THE SECOND.

[Page 111]
ACT III. SCENE I. Hall of Council. The Empress on her throne. Rimuni, Senators, Guards, &c. Rimuni. Rim.
Hear me, my royal mistress! I entreat you:
Add, I beseech you, lords! your voice to mine,
Let not Naritzin dare profane your presence,
Let not the traitor wound his sovereign's ear
With insolent speech! Emp.
                                         No more; my word is pledg'd:
A monarch's word is sacred. 'Tis the grace
Of sovereignty, its attribute, its blessing,
That Mercy's angel-hand should still incline
The scales by Justice pois'd— Rim.
                                         Naritzin never
Will sue for mercy.—I entreat you, hear us:
Recall your word— Emp.
                                         No; be his speech most harsh,
'Twill be less poignant far than self-reproach.
And, sir, his former services still live
Warm in my memory.—Be my will obey'd—
Summon Naritzin—                                          [Herald introduces Naritzin.
                                         You, my lord Rimuni,
[Page 112]

Search out his guilt.—Yet, first, Naritzin, hear me;
Deem not thy sovereign, one who in the hour
Of injur'd majesty, no more retains
The sense and memory of deeds long past
Of loyalty and love.—Say, “I have wrong'd you:
[25]   “Your mercy I implore, forgive th'offence:”
And thou shalt find that in this injur'd bosom
Mercy doth temper justice. Narit.
                                         Gracious sovereign,
For those whose conscience inwardly condemns them,
For guilt which dreads its doom, reserve thy mercy:
Justice alone I claim.—My lord Rimuni,
Of what am I accus'd? Rim.
                                         Thou didst project
Ivan's escape. Day after day, fresh rumours
Disturb the court with tales of Ivan's flight,
And Ivan's friends. For, never yet were wanting,
How light soe'er the scepter'd hand that rules,
Men prone to discontent, and prompt to fill
The realm with kindred slaughter. Such the charge:
To this make answer— Narit.
                                         What reports unvouch'd,
What slander's breath may circulate round courts,
I scorn to answer. Yet— [to the Empress.] I pray your patience!
May I proceed? Emp.
                     At pleasure— Narit.
                                         I must date
From years long past: and, if my speech, perforce,
Tracing time's course, and manifold events,
[Page 113]

Should lightly touch on trivial services
[50]   Heav'n pleas'd that I should render to the state:
Pardon the mention— Emp.
                                         It shall aid thy cause— Narit.
My ancestry is known unto you all;
My fathers, in their day, for pow'r, for valour,
For loyalty renown'd.—Scarce had I gain'd
My sixteenth year, when first, at glory's voice,
Fir'd by the Emperor's fame, I drew my sword.
There are, amid this senate, who beheld
What battles then I fought, what sieges serv'd,
Ere Nystadt seal'd our conquests. Emp.
                                         Your brave deeds
Enrich our country's annals. Narit.
                                         In those wars
I gain'd, not lightly won, the Emperor's love:
And his fam'd guards,—tho' then the manly down
Had scarce my cheek embrown'd—obey'd my word.
The Emperor, whose course was like yon sun
Illumining the world beneath its sway,
Died in his glory. I pass o'er untold
The sovereigns, each in turn, who held the sceptre,
Till Anne bore rule. Anne nam'd her successor
Her elder sister's grandson, then an infant,
The prisoner—Ivan—May it please your highness
To state what follow'd; what Naritzin's service?
[75]   My guilt, if such disloyalty be guilt,
I freely will disclose— Emp. [rising.]
                                         No trivial service—
My glowing heart shall gratefully proclaim it—
[Page 114]

When Ivan lay an infant in his cradle,
And the whole realm was tumult, Lord Naritzin
Felt all a patriot's zeal, a patriot's dread,
Lest this our glorious empire, by the toil
Of Peter rais'd, and by his blood cemented,
Should under foreign faction, and weak sway
Of those misguided rulers, Ivan's parents,
Be wreck'd, and crumbled to a petty state.
The public voice call'd Peter's offspring forth,
Call'd me to wield the sceptre: I obey'd:
And boldly to the throne my claim advanc'd.
At dead of night when I address'd the guard
To vindicate my rights, when round me clamor'd
Tumult and madd'ning fury, when in vain
I lifted up, to awe th'infuriate throng,
That consecrated cross, then, lord Naritzin
Dwelt on my father's fame, and crown'd my brow—
Why hast thou forc'd on me th'ungrateful office
To hear thy guilt? Does then thy heart no more
Glow at the name of my immortal sire,
Nor honour in the sovereign of thy choice
[100]   His living image? Narit.
                                         Still my soul adores
The memory of your sire, and thus [kneels] in you,
Reveres his hallow'd image. Emp. [with warmth.]
                                         On thy faith
I firmly rest. They falsely have accus'd thee;
Break up the senate.—Reassume thy honours:
Resume thy government— Narit.
                                         First, yield me hearing—
[Page 115]
Rim.
It may import your throne, my royal mistress! Emp.
Do not detain me. Narit.
                                         I must pour before you
The anguish of my soul, and speak of Ivan,
That hapless prince— Rim.
                     Prince!—Rebel! Narit.
                                         On thy head
That word, base traitor!—Thou, who hast misus'd
Thy sovereign's favour, else, Naritzin's claims,
And Ivan's piercing cry had reach'd the throne.
Oh miserable realm! whose ruler yields
Th'entrusted rights and duties of the sceptre
To smooth-voic'd sycophants! [addressing Rimuni.] Behold our realm,
That once by Peter's god-like soul exalted
Towr'd proudly eminent, as stateliest pine,
That rooted on the ice-cleft rock, out-braves
[125]   The war of winds, and from its brow majestic
Show'rs into dust impalpable, the weight
Of winter's snows: now droops beneath the gloom
Of luxury and sloth!—Voluptuousness
Has mildew'd its fair growth, stern tyranny
Lopt each brave shoot, and foul corruption chang'd
Its sap and vital nutriment to poison
Circling thro' all its viens.—Rimuni, dread
An injur'd nation's vengeance— Rim. [to the Empress.]
                                         If my zeal
Ere won thy favour, let my word confound
The traitor— Emp.
                                         No— [aside.] His just rebuke—I feel it—
[Page 116]

Plants daggers in my heart. You spake of Ivan;
Proceed— Narit.
                                         At this Rimuni's stern command,
When savage hands had rack'd the hapless Ivan,
When his dire wrongs rang loud on every tongue,
And the deep woe that fill'd each heart, in mine
Was guilt and condemnation, then, before me,
Like a tormenting spirit, day and night
The image of the unoffending victim,
The heir of empire, by my pow'r dethron'd,
Lone, in the unsunn'd dungeon, chain'd, in tortures,
Before me rose: nor ever ceas'd the sting
[150]   Of conscience here to lodge its gather'd venom,
Till the sharp goading of remorse compell'd me,
In expiation of th'offence, to claim
This dreadful charge, and here to dedicate
To solitude and sad obscurity,
The closing of a day whose dawn was glory—
Yet, wholly not unblest, so Heav'n vouchsaf'd me
To shield the helpless from the oppressor's wrong,
And, haply, soothe, if aught on earth might soothe,
The suff'rings of the wrong'd, the outrag'd Ivan. Rim.
Wrong'd, outrag'd Ivan! Lords.
                     Treason— Emp.
                                         Peace, be silent—
I too have human feelings, human pity. Narit.
Outrag'd! I spake the word. Look at this charge,                                          [takes a paper from his bosom.
I would not, for thy sake, my gracious mistress,
Before the public eye produce this deed—
[Page 117]

Once, when I claim'd the charge of Ivan, once
I by constraint perus'd it— Emp.
                                         Lord Rimuni:
Read it— Rim.
Compel me not, my gracious Empress!
Bid me not speak what wisdom would conceal,
Nor deeds recal that after lapse of years
By seeming harshness, may too rudely wound
[175]   Thy gentle nature. Emp.
                                         Thou dost wrong thy sov'reign—
My lord Naritzin! this imports thy honour:
Proclaim aloud the charge, that all may judge,
Blame or applaud thy conduct. Narit. [reads the charge.]
“Guard this Ivan—
“Close fetter'd in a dungeon's cell immure him,
“Far from the light of day, and every eye,
“Save thine. Such food as nature craves, be his.
“His mind is brutalis'd: by means that tame
“The stubborn brute, subdue his savage mood.” Emp.
It bears thy signature, thy name, Rimuni. Narit.
Would that no other name that deed subscrib'd! Emp.
My name! oh heav'n—
I will'd that Ivan should be close immur'd,
Not harshly tortur'd. Narit. [kneels.]
Hear me! Emp.
                                         Wherefore kneel?
Arise. Narit.
Vouchsafe me audience. If this hand
First crown'd your brow, if first I hail'd you, Empress,
[Page 118]

Have pity upon Ivan. From this scroll
Blot out the stain and character of blood.
Not of that fiend, of thy own heart take counsel:
Then, in the splendour of your sire's renown
[200]   His sceptre wield. And oh permit that Ivan—
The wrong'd—the outrag'd—unoffending Ivan,
May in some cloister's sanctuary pass
Life's tranquil day: the peace, the public weal,
The throne's stability, your sacred life,
Claim justly such restraint: but all beyond—
Ruthless oppression. Rim.
                                         Dar'st thou thus proclaim it
Before thy sov'reign's presence? Narit.
                                         Sir, I speak
Under the terror of no earthly pow'r:
[pointing up.] There reigns my judge. Emp.
                                         My lord Rimuni, silence. Narit.
If, haply to have sooth'd by tenderest cares
Him whom my pow'r dethron'd, be deem'd a crime,
Be on my head that guilt! the blest offence
Will whisper peace to my departing soul.
The cell, 'tis true, has Ivan's dwelling been,
Nor other eye than mine, save one on earth,
Has ever glanc'd upon him. Rim.
                                         Ha! another—
Mark'd you his word, dread sov'reign? Emp. [to Naritzin.]
                                         Who? declare it. Narit.
Petrowna. From her lip, day after day,
E'en in the tomb that sepulchres the living,
[225]   Ivan has learnt the words of wisdom, learnt
How best to temper passion, and imbib'd
[Page 119]

The balm of heav'nly solace which religion
Mingles in misery's chalice— Rim. [interrupting him. Aside to the Empress.]
                                         The brute Ivan,
Of cultured reason! 'Tis most perilous.
Not vain the warning. Were this widely rumour'd,
Were it but whisper'd in the public ear,
The realm would rise in arms. My gracious Sov'reign!
Bid hence the senate. I beseech you, hear me. Emp.
My spirit is sore troubled. Rim.
                                         I entreat you,
Let me dismiss them. Loyal tho' they seem,
They must not share this counsel. Emp.
                                         Bid them hence. Rim.
My lords! awhile retire.                                          [The Senate and Naritzin depart. Emp.
                                         What now thy counsel? Rim.
It was no idle rumour reach'd your throne
Of Ivan's followers, and projected rescue—
All is confirm'd. And—but you do not heed me— Emp.
Be brief. Rim.
Your throne, your sacred life's at hazard.
Be judge yourself: before you, face to face,
Bid forth the boy, and witness what his nature.
His nature! Who can doubt it? Aptly tutor'd:
[250]   All mildness! All submission! But beware!
Sudden, in full-grown strength, mature for vengeance
The lion from his secret lair will spring,
And crush you in his fury— Emp.
                                         Yes—I dread him.
[Page 120]
Rim.
Were the boy dead, then would your soul know peace!
There are—I know the man, whose loyal zeal
Would rid you of that fear. Emp.
                                         By murder? Never— Rim.
You—or the boy. Emp.
                                         Oh heap not on my soul
That added guilt. Rim.
                                         Think not Rimuni's nature
Inclines to deeds of blood. The sacred duty
To guard your life compels me. Emp.
                                         Spare me—spare me. Rim.
I wish not Ivan's death: but say, where breathes
On earth—I do not know that living man—
On whom my soul in fearless confidence
Can rest such perilous charge. Emp.
                                         Yes. One I know
In whom I firmly trust. Rim.
                                         Then I conjure you,
Bind on his soul by heav'n-attested vows,
This solemn charge, to stab without remorse
[275]   The boy, if fraud or force attempt his rescue.
Till then, as wont, within th'imprisoning cell
Closely immure him. Emp.
                                         'Tis most wisely counsell'd.
Bid lord Naritzin in yon cloister's cell
Attend my summons. Rim.
                     Lord Naritzin! Emp.
                                         Speed.
Bid him there wait my presence. And, I charge you,
[Page 121]

At hazard of my deep displeasure charge you,
Let none approach the spot. My will is fix'd:
Reply not: be thy sov'reign's word obey'd.                                          [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Cave of the Conspirators. Conspirators. Mirovitz. Feodor . Con. [to Mirovitz.]
Detain us not. Most dangerous this delay.
Now fix the hour: give each his separate charge.
But—if you doubt our word— Miro. [interrupting him.]
                                         I doubt you not. Con.
On—to the altar lead us:
There pledge our souls to Ivan's cause, there bind us
To slay whoe'er withstands his sov'reign's rescue.
Behold us fix'd. Miro.
                                         Hear then my last resolve.
You know the tyrannous custom of this fort,
Month after month, fresh troops the isle surround,
And night by night, new guards keep watch and ward
Round Ivan's cell. This night that charge is ours.
[300]   I, when the hour strikes twelve, relieve the watch.
Now, one by one, pledge your brave hands with mine.
You, [selecting two in turn.] guard the outward draw-bridge: you, the gates
Of the first tow'r: the iron draw-bridge, yours:
Your charge, the inner fort: you, guard the vaults
That wind thro' ways obscure to Ivan's cell:
[Page 122]

You, bold Truwarotz, and brave Voronetz,
You, at his cell take station: thine, my brother,
The eastern turret: o'er its crested brow—
Be watchful—If all favour our design,
At stroke of one, a lighted beacon raise;
Wave it distinctly thrice:—at the third signal
We rush to Ivan's cave, and force our entrance
If aught our way oppose. A sail now waits
My summons, o'er Ladoga's lake, to waft us
To liberty, to wealth, to fame, to honour.                                          [Exeunt.

END OF ACT THE THIRD.

[Page 123]
ACT IV. SCENE I. The Cloisters. Empress and Naritzin . Emp.
My lord Naritzin, on thy faith I rest:
I shall pour forth, as truth and nature urge,
My secret soul before thee. Oh! I would
That I had never wielded in this hand
The sceptre reft from Ivan! Since that hour,
However outwardly I bear my pomp,
And arm my brow with confidence, within
Fear and suspicion that nor day nor night
Have rest, possess me. I, by violence
The empire seiz'd: declare what voice has pow'r
To say in accents that may win assent,
“Go, be at peace, repose thou in thy strength,
“Nor dread the avenger.” Narit.
                                         Whom have you to fear? Emp.
My successor. I gave the dire example.
Yet more, I dread thy charge, the prisoner Ivan.
But yesterday I did despise the boy,
I rank'd him with the very herd that crop
The grassy clod—Thy voice—the senate heard it—
Profusely blazon'd forth his praise—The realm
Once hail'd him king, and I before him bow'd,
First of his titled slaves. Narit.
                                         You are his sovereign,
[Page 124]

And on your word his weal or woe depends.
[25]   Give him to breathe the air that breathes on all,
And gaze upon the blessed light of heav'n.
Mistake me not, it is not my request
That you should rashly free him to the gaze
And shout of the capricious people. No:
Let him have commerce with religious men,
Where he may safely harbour: bind his soul
By rigid vows all dedicate to heav'n:
And to the general voice that shouts thy name,
Ivan will add his blessing. Emp.
                                         No, I dare not:
Young as he is, and beautiful, and mild,
Compassion for his fate would gather strength
That must o'erturn my throne. I dare not free him:
Yet I would fain that Ivan breath'd in peace.
Thou can'st secure it— Narit.
                     How? Emp.
                                         'Tis in thy power
That he shall breathe the air that breathes on all,
And gaze upon the blessed light of heav'n;
And that his limbs bow not beneath their weight,
Wanting free space to move in. I dare trust
But thee alone. E'en in thy crime confest,
Thy treason, disobedience, I remark'd
A sense of duty that did shame the vaunt
[50]   Of smooth court flatterers—Is it thy desire
To lighten Ivan's misery? Narit.
                                         By my own— Emp.
Naritzin, reassume the charge of Ivan:
Assuage his misery: where'er thou art,
[Page 125]

Throughout the day, long as thou hold'st the rule
Of this dread fort, be at thy side the youth
E'en as a son most lov'd: yet, still at night-fall
Closely immure him in th'imprisoning cell.
This be his lot, so thou yon heav'n attest
That thy firm hand shall in his bosom plunge
This weapon, [presenting a dagger.] if or fraud or force again
Attempt his rescue. Narit.
                                         I refuse the charge. Emp.
This sacred dagger at Pultowa sav'd
My sire, thy lord, from death: this now shall save
His daughter, by thy patriot zeal enthron'd. Narit.
Recall thy pardon, reassume thy honours,
Forget the vow that never blood should stain
Thy sceptre, be Naritzin's bold disloyalty
By death aveng'd—I will not touch that dagger. Emp.
Reflect, a thousand arms, a thousand daggers
Will vindicate thy sovereign: force me not
On deeds of blood: fain would my soul avoid them.
Thy sovereign sues, commands thee. Take it, [the dagger.] Ivan
[75]   Lives but to bless Naritzin: thy refusal
Is Ivan's instant death. Narit.
                                         Not on my head
Be innocent blood! Emp. [to a guard without.]
Bid Lord Rimuni hither. Narit.
A moment's pause. I know his ruthless nature.
[Page 126]
Emp.
Bid Lord Rimuni hither! Speed— Narit.
                                         Yet, stay—
Rimuni or Naritzin now shall perish.
Pledge but your word, and I accept the charge. Emp.
What thy intent? Narit.
                                         Your fame, a nation's weal—
Swear, ere another sun shall light the world,
For ever from th'indignant realm to banish
Rimuni. Are you silent? Plunge the dagger,
Murd'ress, in Ivan's heart: so to your grave
Go down with charge of blood upon your brow:
So, in your sin, at heav'n's dread call, arise
Before the King of kings. Emp.
                                         Ere yonder sun
Resumes his course, Rimuni flies the realm.
Take thou this weapon. [he takes it.] Narit.
                                         Ivan shall not reign. Emp.
Receive thy sovereign's thanks—o'er populous Ingria
Thy government extends. Narit.
[100]                                            I seek no honours.
As yet thou art unstain'd [drawing the dagger.] with innocent blood.
Let me depart. Emp.
                                         Yet hear me—Stay—Thy sovereign
Ere sun-set quits the isle: but, ere I leave
These scenes for ever,
My lord, I must hold conference with Ivan— Nar.
Not, I implore you, ere you have made known
Your purpose to Petrowna.
[Page 127]
Emp.
                     Why? Narit.
                                         Her voice
Tempers at will his spirit: her fix'd glance
Holds magic influence o'er him. Emp.
                                         Say, her sov'reign
Commands her to her presence. Narit.
                                         I beseech you,
With tenderness, with pity, question Ivan.
And, I implore you, spare Petrowna's ear
The charge of murder: hide from her the vow
That past my lip. From Ivan's doom'd assassin,
Her eye would turn abhorrent. Emp.
                                         Trust my caution—
Haste! bid her hither. [Naritzin goes.] —Ha! her voice, her glance
Hold magic influence o'er him! 'tis most palpable!
Tutor'd by her! and who but this Petrowna
[125]   Has Ivan's misery sooth'd? his weal, his woe,
Not mine, her spirit sways. My throne, my life,
Rests on this woman: 'tis most hazardous.
The boy now ripens into man, with manhood,
Ambition, vengeance, his acknowledg'd claim
To rule, will rouse ungovernable thoughts.
All must be plainly told; the husband's vow
Must yoke the wife; so shall Petrowna quench
Each latent spark that glows in Ivan's bosom,
And I in peace repose. Petrowna enters. Pet.
                                         My lord Naritzin
Bade me attend your presence. Deign, accept
[Page 128]

My thanks, how due! that once more on Naritzin
His sov'reign's favour rests. Emp.
                                         On his obedience,
My favour rests. Pet.
                                         Yet not th'entrusted charge,
Nor gifts, nor high rewards, nor added honours,
Have smooth'd his brow. Methought, unwonted gloom
Darken'd his cheek, as swift he hurried on
To hide in loneliness thoughts ill at ease. Emp.
I know the cause: and it doth much import thee
To feel its force. His sov'reign to his pray'r
Bow'd gracious, when thy lord, at once to lighten
The doom of Ivan, and to drive Rimuni
[150]   For ever from this realm— Pet. [interrupting her.]
Belov'd Naritzin!
Heav'n on thy head its choicest treasures show'r! Emp.
Vow'd—to prevent by death—the prisoner's flight,
If fraud or force should ere attempt his rescue.
You mark my words. Pet.
                                         Too plainly—murder Ivan. Emp.
His vow is ratifi'd in heav'n. Pet.
                                         Say—rather—
Where demons howl in torture. Emp.
                                         Hear, Petrowna!
Thy sov'reign speaks. Pet.
                                         Naritzin murder Ivan!
It shall not be. Emp.
                                         Fain would I see the youth:
[Page 129]

Hold converse with him: and myself observe
If rumour vilely has degraded him
To the low level of a senseless brute:
Or, as Naritzin vaunted it, if Ivan
Be grac'd with high endowments. Pet. [aside.]
                                         Oh my soul!
'Tis as I fear'd. Her eye shall not glance on him.
If fear can curb, or pity melt the heart,
They shall not meet.
[To the Empress.] You once did look on Ivan:
[175]   And—you remember—the wide realm yet dwells
On that heart-rending scene. The very soldiers
Wept, they who crown'd you, when their rude hands cast
The infant, sweetly lock'd in cradled slumber,
Beneath thy throne: they wept who heard the shout
Of thousands, at whose uproar, Ivan woke,
Stretch'd out his little hands, and oft-time clapt
In sign of transport. Then thy cheek was seen
To bow o'er his, and on his smiling lip
Thy tears perforce gush'd down, while round thy neck,
(As thine had been the breast that nurtur'd him,)
His innocent arms were twin'd. Emp.
                                         'Tis ever present,
It troubles my night-vision. Why recal it? Pet.
Poor Ivan was not then a senseless brute.
Sore misery has marr'd the loveliest being
That ere kind heav'n gave birth to. Fell barbarians!
Fiends that they were to root out Nature's flow'r,
And plant their weeds envenom'd in its place!
Do not again look on him.
[Page 130]
Emp.
                                         Why dissuade me? Pet.
By the remembrance of that moving scene,
By dread of horrors that may yet ensue,
If there be pow'r in words to change the will,
Thou shalt not look on Ivan. Emp.
[200]                                            Not look on him! Pet.
Where? on what spot of earth would'st thou confront him? Emp.
I understand thee not: explain thy meaning. Pet.
Where meet him? In the cell that drinks his groan? Emp.
No—rather in the sepulchre of death. Pet.
Here? In the light of day? Beneath heav'n's beam
Canst thou with still unswerving look, sustain
The light'ning of his eye when fix'd on thine?
Do not again behold him. Emp.
                                         Here conduct him. Pet.
Oh never, never more thy tear will fall
As once upon his cheek. Emp.
                     Oh! Pet.
                                         Thou hast reign'd
Triumphant; revelry, and joy, and feast,
Shouts of applause, and all that earth most envies,
Have made thy throne their dwelling. Think on Ivan.
Do your tears fall? turn not away: they fall,
Accepted offering to offended heav'n:
And every tear mingled with penitence,
Will wash and cleanse from off thy secret soul,
A spot of deep pollution. Nature form'd thee
Kind, gentle, generous.
[Page 131]
Emp.
                                         Presumptuous woman!
What prompts thee, rashly daring, to address
[225]   Thy sov'reign thus? Pet.
                                         At midnight, I have wept
O'er Ivan's flinty couch, and quak'd to hear,
When all was still, his shriek of agony:
'Tis this that makes me bold, and bids my voice
Thus warn you: hold not conference with Ivan. Emp.
Hear, and obey my word. A secret mystery
Perplexes all. I will enquire and judge. Petr. [Aside.]
'Tis vain to move her.—Is then thy intent
That hapless Ivan should before thy senate
Appear, that those harsh men should probe his weakness:
Or thou alone confront him? Emp.
                                         I, alone— Pet.
'Tis perilous— Emp.
                                         Unfold thy meaning—Say too,
(For thou no doubt hast aptly taught the boy,)
What are his rare endowments? Pet.
                                         Heavn's best gift,
The heart's warm sympathies that render back
Kindness for kindness, love for love—Not vainly
In fruitless lore I wasted the brief hour
Allotted to console him: yet, I taught him,
('Twas all I taught, for I did rate his life
But at a moment's hazard) to o'ercome
Calamity by patience, to repose
[250]   In confidence on heav'n, and to resign
[Page 132]

Not unprepar'd, unwarn'd of violent death,
His soul without a murmur unto God.
So have I rear'd him. Yet, at times— Emp.
                                         Why silent? Pet.
Are there not wrongs and dreadful sufferings
Whose very mention, in each human bosom
Stirs righteous indignation? Hence, I dread
What may ensue, Ivan and thou, alone—
At sight of her who from his temples reft
The crown his fathers wore, whose stern command
Has robb'd his day of light, whose ruthless ministers
Have rack'd his tender limbs, will not the fiend
Rouse him to madd'ning horror? Thou hast heard it—
If then instructed thus in Ivan's nature,
Thy will is fix'd to commune lonely with him,
I must not be far distant. Emp.
                                         I will see him.                                          [Petrowna goes.
Lead Ivan hither. Speed—away—reply not.
How is it with me? What strange fear appalls?
Where'er I turn, some victim of oppression
Starts up, methinks, before me, and aloud
Cries vengeance.—Ere yon westering sun descends
I will depart: I would not here be found
When nature seeks repose.—Hark, hark, a footstep!
[275]   No, 'twas my fear. Why did I wish to see
The injur'd Ivan? What is my intent?
That I myself should witness what his nature?
[Page 133]

How judge, when terror fills my inmost soul?
I hear them: 'tis a footstep: it draws near—
Oh spirit of my father! be thou present,
Sustain thy drooping child! Pet. [behind the scenes.]
Ivan— Emp.
                                         I hear her:
It was Petrowna's voice: how mildly sweet!
So a fond mother welcomes in her child. Pet. [behind the scenes]
Lean on me—do not linger—Gaze no more
On yon bright orb. Ivan enters, looking back, leaning on Petrowna. Ivan.
                                         Was that the blessed sun
That lights the spacious world? Yon orb of fire?
Say, can you stilly gaze on it, Petrowna,
With unaverted eye? Mine it o'erpow'rs:
All, all is darkling round me. Oh support me! Pet.
Lean closer on me. Ivan.
                                         Tho' it pains my sight,
Let me again behold it! Pet.
                                         Turn not, Ivan!
The Empress is before you. Emp. [aside.]
                                         Hapless youth!
How hast thou suffer'd! Ivan.
[300]                                            Oh that piercing air!
You said it would be pleasant to my sense:
But it comes shivering over me, keenly chill:
Yet is its breath most sweet. Aid me, Petrowna!
[Page 134]

My limbs sink under me. I pray thee, hide me
In the dark dungeon. Let me not behold her. Pet.
Remember thou thy promise; kneel, implore
Her mercy. Ivan.
                                         'Tis thy will—Lead, lead me to her.
Still on my sight the dazzling sun-beams flash.
Where is the Empress? Emp. [aside, as Ivan slowly advances.]
                                         Fair indeed his form!
Most beautiful! of growth beyond his years!
Of port commanding!—Ivan! Ivan.
                                         Whose that voice?
'Tis harsh unto mine ear. Speak, speak, Petrowna! Pet.
The Empress graciously extends her hand
In sign of kindness. I entreat you, Ivan,
Implore her pity— Ivan.
                                         I will kneel before her— [kneels.
Not for myself I sue thee. Hear my prayer! Emp.
I am not of harsh mood. Witness these tears! Pet. [to the Empress.]
Must I retire? Emp.
                                         Leave me not lone with Ivan—
Yet his no brutal nature— Ivan.
[325]                                            Scorn me not. Emp.
I cannot longer gaze upon his face.
Lead him away. Ivan.
                                         No, not till thou hast heard me. Emp.
What would'st thou? Ivan.
                                         And hast thou the heart to ask it? Emp.
Take, take him hence. Ivan.
                                         No; to thy knees I cling.
[Page 135]

None but thyself can give my bosom peace—
I do entreat thee, as thou lov'st the heav'ns
That on thy brow have show'rd felicity,
Vouchsafe reply!—Live they, my wretched parents? Emp.
They live— Ivan.
                                         And is their life— Pet. [interrupting him.]
Oh, ask no more! Ivan
Like Ivan's? How! you answer not! Have mercy!
Have mercy! 'Tis for me alone they suffer!
For me they are deprived of air, of light,
Of liberty. My crown is on thy brow:
Wear it, and to thy successor, at will,
Bequeath it.—But, if thou have hope for mercy,
Release poor Ivan's parents, and leave me
To heaven and to Petrowna. Pet.
                                         Oh! assuage
The anguish of his spirit! Emp.
[350]                                            Hast thou, Ivan,
No other pray'r? None for thyself? Speak freely:
Nay, dread me not— Ivan.
                                         What should I dread? Behold me. Emp. [aside.]
Oh that the voice of truth had reach'd my throne!
That I had known his gentle nature! [to him.] Ivan,
It may import thee much, the truth declare,
Has aught unwarranted by Lord Naritzin
Ere in thy cell found entrance? Ivan.
                                         Dark and deep
My dwelling, far from human sight and sound:
[Page 136]

And the sepulchral roof that closes o'er me
The bound that parts the living from the dead. Emp. [aside.]
It wounds my soul. Ivan.
                                         The elements alone
In their illimitable sweep had pow'r
To interrupt my solitude: and oft
From unendurable loneliness arous'd,
I have giv'n answer to the voice of winds
That heav'd the roaring waves; and I have leapt
In transport from my flinty couch, to welcome
The thunder as it burst upon my roof,
And beckon'd, to the light'ning as it flash'd
And sparkled on these fetters: while in vain
I proffer'd, where the volley fiercely blaz'd,
[375]   My forehead to its death-stroke. Emp.
                                         'Tis too horrible! Pet.
No; not the roar of winds, the thunder's crash,
The inward whisper of a guilty spirit
Alone is insupportable— Ivan.
                                         Yet, hear me!
Not for myself I sue thee, 'tis for them
My bosom bleeds, for them, my wretched parents,
Imprison'd for my crime: the crime, that Ivan
Was born to rule: waste not in vain lament,
Waste not on me unfruitful tears—I know
My hapless doom, and am prepar'd to suffer.
But, pity those who mourn the living Ivan,
And call the day accurst, which gave to light
Me, their first-born. Pause you? your silence kills—
Scorn not these tears!—
[Page 137]
Pet.
                                         I dread what may ensue.
You heeded not his pray'r. Rage knits his brow. Ivan.
Thou call'd a God on earth, hast thou no mercy? Pet.
His agitated bosom labours high
With violence unwonted. [To the Empress.] I exhort you,
Avoid his sight. Emp.
                                         The voice of majesty
Shall curb his rage. Ivan! Pet.
                                         Not thus address him:
[400]   Not with loud voice of stern command! Hear, Ivan!
Withdraw. [To the Empress.] His cheek is fire, his eye darts flame.
Ivan. [to the Empress.] Withdraw! Emp. [on Ivan's approach.]
He heeds thee not, Petrowna,
Stand thou between us: 'tis thy sov'reign calls
On thee for aid. Pet.
                                         Stay, Ivan! Ivan. [fronting the Empress.]
Thou, the usurper!
Is this the crowned brow? Let me behold it.
I will confront its terrors. Who art thou,
Mortal! that mock'st omnipotence? Who, thou,
That in the hollow of thy right hand grasp'st
Yon orb of light, and with thy left hast yok'd
The freedom of the winds; and criest aloud,
“Sun! shine not thou on that devoted head!
“Nor let thy pure breath, unimprison'd air!
“Make cool those fever'd temples!” Let me trace
[Page 138]

The signature and majesty of heav'n
Stampt on thy front. Emp. [sinking on her seat.]
Help—I am faint—Support me. Pet.
Ivan—He hears me not—I ne'er have witness'd
Such violence of rage—He knows me not—
'Tis past control— Ivan. [his passion gradually rises to frenzy.]
                                         Turn not away—Behold me.
What trace I on that brow? Woe, terror, shame.
[425]   Where now thy pow'r, thy sov'reignty o'er Ivan?
Usurper! from thy temples lift the crown,
And fix it on my brow, and at my feet
Seek pardon. Give the sceptre to my wielding.
Mark its just use—Haste! ope the prison gates.
Lo! how they issue forth, faint, pale, afraid
To look upon the light! Lo! how they creep
Bow'd down on the strange earth, like beings unus'd
To gaze on heav'n with man's erected front!
[to the Empress.] Art thou my mother? Oh! I knew thee not.
Let me kiss off those tears that bathe thy cheek:
They long have sever'd us. Come! to my arms!
Oh shield me from that torturer! [Petrowna.] Shield thy chield! Pet.
Ivan! it is Petrowna. Ivan. [struggling with her.]
Off, barbarian!
They ne'er shall part us more. [Embracing the Empress.] Come: you shall hear
[Page 139]

Strange tales of Ivan. To my prison stole
A monk, a wily man: long years of suffering
Have since toil'd by: and the swol'n wave—I saw it—
Foam'd o'er him. Mark how he allur'd my boyhood—
He told me I should wander in green fields,
And wreathe fresh flow'rs and garlands, where gay birds
Sing in their bow'rs, and gurgling streamlets wind
Thro' sun-shine glades their many-dimpled rills,
But—'twas to plunge me deeper, deeper-down,
[450]   In midnight darkness. [To Petrowna.] Hence, thou fiend! away!
Why, why pursue me to this sunless cave?
Is this too thy doom'd haunt? Emp. [to Petrowna.]
                                         Loose not thy hold— Ivan. [to the Empress.]
Weep not, dear mother? By thy tears I know thee;
Haply thou know'st not Ivan: not this flesh
So strangely mangled. 'Twas not thus, when first
Thy tear of joy gush'd on the new-born babe.
But—never shall the torturers vex us more.
Hush! hush! No ear must hear it—'Twas Petrowna,
Not that false monk, that spake of freedom, empire—
Hush! hush! Emp.
                     Ha! Pet.
                                         Heed not! these are words of frenzy— Emp. [to Petrowna.]
Forget not the dread oath. Ivan. [to the Empress.]
                                         Nay—be at rest.
Cloud not thy brow. The usurper shall implore
[Page 140]

Forgiveness, and kneel prostrate at our foot-stool.
Off, off, fell fiend!                                          [to Petrowna.] Emp.
                                         Let him not 'scape thy arms. Ivan.
I can no more resist. Strike not again. Pet.
My son! He falls exhausted: [Ivan falls.] prone on earth. Ivan.
Once: twice: they murder me in prison. Help!
Strike at th'anointed brow. Beware, fell fiend!
The eye of heav'n is on you. Pet.
[475]                                            Ivan, Ivan!
Hear, my beloved son! it is Petrowna,
It is thy mother clasps thee in her arms.
My voice has reach'd him. Ivan. [recovering.]
                                         Is it thou, Petrowna?
A fearful vision had disturb'd my sense. Emp.
Hide him from me for ever. From this isle
I haste—farewell. Think on Naritzin's oath.                                          [The Empress goes. Ivan.
My limbs sink under me—support me. Pet.
                                         Ivan!
Lean on me. In these arms once more find peace.

END OF ACT THE FOURTH.

[Page 141]
ACT V. SCENE I. An unfrequented spot nigh the Castle. Dark night. Rimuni, Altorf. Alt.
My lord! here linger not: your doom is fix'd.
Now, as the secret senate clos'd, I met
Count Olbert. Speed, I pray, your instant flight,
And underneath the night's propitious gloom
Haste from the isle. The royal word has doom'd you
To hopeless exile. Rim.
                     Not behold me! Alt.
                                         Never—
The Empress is inexorable. Rim.
                                         Ha! Alt.
An oath, a sacred vow has bound her soul
To drive you from her presence. Here delay not—
Ere the strong hand of pow'r arrest your flight,
Speed, quit the isle. Siberia's wilds await you
If but another sun behold you here.
Naritzin is restored to all his honours,
And with the charge of Ivan, added proofs
Of royal favour court him. Rim.
                                         Court Naritzin!
Then farewell hope! I charge thee, faithful friend,
[Page 142]

Let it be widely rumor'd that Rimuni
Fled suddenly the isle. Farewell! [Altorf goes.] Naritzin!
Thou first in favour!—Bind by oath her soul
To banish me for ever! Wayward woman!
[25]   I will not crouch beneath the foot that spurns me.
What then remains? Insatiate thoughts that prompt
Stern deeds, and the unyielding spirit of vengeance
That lays the oppressor low. 'Tis known to all
That Mirovitz o'er Ivan holds the night-watch:
Add too—so will'd the usurper—the whole isle
Reels, surfeited with wine and revel feasting—
By heav'n! it must succeed, if Mirovitz—
And well I know his nature—aid my purpose.
At the north rampart I will cross his round—
Ivan shall reign, and this ingrate usurper
Kneel slave-like at his footstool.                                          [Exit. Scene, the North Ramparts. Mirovitz and Feodor enter. Feo.
The midnight hour is past. Say, Mirovitz,
Are all prepar'd? Mir.
                                         At one, we rescue Ivan.
Success must crown the attempt. All now concurs,
The guard, the day's late revels, this dark night.
Look! how the dull moon labours in her course:
Those vapours, streak'd with ruddy gleams, portend
The gathering of the winds: and yon bleak clouds
That thicken in the south, will quickly waft us
[Page 143]

To the lone isle; and say, what eye can note us?
E'en those whose restless lids, unseal'd by slumber
Ope at this hour, are all o'er-charg'd with fumes
Of wine and riotous feast. Feo.
[50]                                            But how deceive
Naritzin's search? His unremitting zeal
Visits throughout the fort, from cell to cell,
The nightly watch. Mir.
                                         His unremitting zeal!
How fruitless! All, e'en to suspicion's eye,
Shall seem secure. The hour, the occasion urge:
These now neglected, say, what hope hereafter?
All now is fix'd, and years on years may pass
Ere men so leagu'd here meet. It must succeed—
At the high altar I have bound their souls
To free their king. Rimuni enters.
                                         Ha! at this hour, what spy
Here basely lurks? Thy name, thy purpose, speak! Rim.
Rimuni—Vengeance— Mir.
                                         'Tis confirm'd, I know it—
That thou art, like myself, a man disgrac'd:
The sunshine, whose meridian blaze illum'd thee,
Is suddenly obscur'd— Rim.
                                         For ever set.
Yet not the less, e'en in the senate lurk
Men to my will devote: brave men who scorn
The weak usurper; lords of might and pow'r
To 'stablish on the empire of his sires
The sovereign of thy choice.
[Page 144]
Mir.
[75]                        My choice! Who? Rim.
                                         Ivan.
Elizabeth is hateful to thy soul:
Take my pledg'd hand. Perish Elizabeth!
This night you hold o'er Ivan watch: this night
The isle is all dissolv'd in revel feasting.
Who, save Naritzin, can control our course?
Command this weapon. I have basely wrong'd thee;
Yet—if the galling yoke of dire oppression,
The bond of common suffering can unite
Brave men who brook not wrong, lo one whose hand
Fears not to execute the boldest deed
Thy spirit dares conceive. Miro.
                                         The proof awaits thee.
Thou at my side attend; be bold, be faithful:
If faithless—lo thy doom. [drawing a dagger.] Go, Feodor,
Speed to the eastern turret: at the stroke
Of one—be vigilant—the beacon raise:
Wave it distinctly thrice. At the third signal
We rush to Ivan's cell, and force our entrance,
If aught our way oppose. Feo.
                                         I shall not fail—
Farewell.                                          [Feodor goes. Miro.
Speed, hour of vengeance! if we fail,
Better to perish boldly, than contemn'd,
[100]   Live unaveng'd. Success or death awaits us.                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 145]
Scene, Petrowna's Apartment. Petrowna. Pet.
'Tis horrible! premeditated murder!
Fell fiend, to lodge thy poison in my heart,
To force on me the secret, that Naritzin
Has bound his soul, by solemn oath confirm'd it,
To slay the innocent Ivan! How prevent it?
Thy wrongs, oh Ivan! fill the realm with horror:
And each new day, each hour in rapid flight,
Engenders new revolts. Oh heav'n! I view
Him whom I lov'd, rever'd, ador'd, a murderer,
Spotted with innocent blood. Relentless demon,
To link Naritzin to thy fell design!
Our bond of love was interchange of souls,
Each in the other center'd: how, how live
In uncommunicating wretchedness!
Hark! 'tis the tow'r's loud chime, [the chime heard.] 'twixt twelve and one.
'Tis past his wonted hour. Why stays Naritzin?
Some unforeseen event—perchance—some tumult!
Merciful heav'n! Ho!                                          [Calling the Guard. Guard.
                                         Did I hear thy call? Pet.
Say, is thy lord return'd? Guard.
                                         No foot this night
Has past the gate. Pet.
                                         Let Albert now go forth,
And bid him speed, I charge you, and observe
[125]   If all is peace and quiet. Bid him speed,
[Page 146]

And bring swift tidings of thy lord's approach.                                          [Guard goes.
Naritzin shuns my presence, and avoids,
Bleak tho' the storm, and late th'ungenial hour,
This sheltering roof. His painful charge, as wont,
Urg'd him to visit in their cells, ere midnight,
Th'entrusted prisoners. Has he look'd on Ivan?
And told the victim that Petrowna's husband
Is doom'd to shed his blood. Galvez enters.
                                         Galvez! most welcome,
Where is thy lord? Gal.
                                         But now we cross'd the draw-bridge:
I saw him slowly passing towards the castle. Pet.
How! underneath this roof, and still avoid me?
Say, was all peace and quiet on your round?
No sight, no sound unwonted? Gal.
                                         All, methought,
Seem'd tranquil—but—                                          [A footstep heard. Pet.
I hear his footstep. Hence.                                          [Galvez goes.
How solemn his approach! Naritzin enters, and lays down his sword and dagger. Narit.
                                         Thou here! oh heav'n! Pet.
Late is the hour of thy return, and bleak
The gales of night sweep round the battlements
That crest the fort. You are o'er-tir'd, I fear:
[Page 147]

The chill breeze, and the night storm's ceaseless fury,
[150]   Have sorely harass'd thee. Narit.
                                         I reck'd them not:
'Tis not the outward storm—'tis here—'tis here. Pet.
Come to thy rest. Nar.
                                         Thou too, at this late hour?
Why art thou absent from thy peaceful chamber?
I did not look to find thee waking, love,
Or I ere now had urg'd my homeward step.
I pray thee to thy chamber. Pet.
                                         But—thou seem'st
By misery opprest. I dread to ask thee—
Yet—I beseech thee. In thy nightly round— Nar.
Wherefore this silence? Pet.
                                         Say, was all secure? Narit.
All seem'd secure. Pet.
                                         But—was there aught? Oh tell me? Narit.
As I drew near the fort that guards the prisoners,
Methought I heard the whisper of a voice,
In utterance like Rimuni's. But—in vain
I search'd each spot—'twas idle fancy— Pet.
                                         Whispers!
And—utterance like Rimuni's! heav'n forefend!
Yet—for it closely presses on my soul,
Tell me, Naritzin, when your search explor'd
The prisoners dungeons, did you look on Ivan?
[175]   Fain would I know, after this day of trouble,
If calm his sleep. Narit.
                                         I left his cell unsearch'd.
[Page 148]

I could not interrupt poor Ivan's slumber.
The innocent may sleep. Pet.
                                         Since last we parted,
Hast thou of aught held conference with him? Narit.
                                         No. Pet. [in transport.]
Then Ivan knows it not. Narit.
                                         Not know it? what?
What words have 'scap'd thy lips? unfold their meaning? Pet.
How! said I aught? oh heed it not! the tongue
At times will murmur words devoid of sense. Narit.
Give me, I pray, strict answer. Did the Empress— Pet. [confused.]
The Empress! Narit.
                                         Why thus troubled? did the Empress
Disclose— Pet.
Oh peace! spare, spare me yet awhile.
My spirit is within me bow'd and broken—
My husband! we will talk of this hereafter.
Oh! let us taste the blessing of repose,
And to kind angels reconcile our thoughts,
Ere deeper woe assail us. Do not linger:
Sleep will not on my eye-lid shed its balm,
While thou art absent.                                          [Petrowna goes. Narit.
[200]                                            Never on my lid
Shall slumber shed the blessing of repose.
'Tis as I fear'd, the Empress has betray'd
The fatal secret. Underneath the veil
Of tempting words, e'en in Petrowna's smile,
I noted the sharp pang that rack'd her soul.
[Page 149]

I am her bane and horror. Thro' the day
Her eye will wither mine with frozen look,
And in her dreams, her night-shriek will denounce
Vengeance on Ivan's murderer. Of his crown
I reft the innocent child: I now am doom'd
With this infernal gift, to pierce his heart—
So, guilt engenders guilt, till, ripe for vengeance
On the offender's brow, eternal justice
Heaps retribution. Judge of heav'n and earth,
Now ere this blade drops blood, in mercy strike me! Galvez hastily enters.
Whence this intrusion? say— Gal.
                                         My lord, a soldier
Seeks instant entrance. Narit.
                                         Hither quickly lead him. Galvez and Ortosk enter.
Say, at this hour why seek me here? Ort.
                                         My lord!
As on my watch I duly went my round,
About the noon of day, I chanc'd to spy
A boat beneath the fort, and on the shore
[225]   An old man, and two youths, in guise, it seem'd,
Of fishermen, who on the Neva earn
Their bread by daily toil: as I approach'd
(Awhile unseen) I heard their busy tongues:
Words indistinct, save that I plainly noted
Their conference was of Ivan. Narit.
                                         Oh beware!
[Page 150]

Mislead me not! Of Ivan! Ivan's woe,
Ivan's sad tale is rife on every tongue. Ort.
But there was further meaning in their words
Than idle pity, or I mainly err.
I warn'd them from that spot, and on I past
So thought they, to my round: but close I watch'd them.
Their skiff is moor'd, in secret, underneath
The birch, whose hoar boughs overhang the flood:
And, my day-duty done, I there observ'd them
Watching the flight of the clouds, as men prepar'd
Ere long to hoist the sail. Narit.
                                         Speed, trusty Galvez!
My sword—that dagger! Take thy weapons with thee.
Soldier! attend us.
Petrowna! 'tis for thee my bosom bleeds.
Oh be deep slumber on her! Speed we forth
To Ivan's cell.                                          [They go. Pet. [behind the scenes.]
Wherefore this long delay? Petrowna enters.
[250]   It tortures me. My lord Naritzin? Gone.
What ho! Who guards the portal? Soldier enters.
Where is thy lord? Sol
                                         But now he past the gate.
[Page 151]
Pet.
Alone? Sol.
                                         No, Galvez with him. Swift they sped:
With them a soldier of the fort— Pet.
                                         Lead on:
To Ivan's cell. In thy good guard I trust.                                          [They go. Scene changes to the outside of Ivan's cell. A gloomy vault feebly lighted. Naritzin, Galvez, Ortosk , enter. Narit.
Soldier! on yon commanding bastion take
Thy stand: that eminence o'erlooks the fortress:
Note carefelly if aught unwonted strike
Thy wary eye: and give me timely warning.                                          [Stations him on the outside of the scene.
I charge you, on your life, keep strictest watch.
Galvez, there take thy stand: [Stations Galvez on the opposite side.] and, at my summons
Speed quickly hither.—Not a sound—no motion—
Oh that the roar of winds, the crash of thunder
Peal'd thro' these noiseless vaults! so might they silence
These audible throbs, this tempest in my heart!
There, Ivan! there thou slumber'st, [approaching the cell.] in yon dungeon.
Now, when I visited the prisoners' cells,
Each, one by one, tho' there my main charge lay,
I could not break on Ivan's hour of rest.
Thrice I drew near the cell, with full intent
To warn him of my vow: My heart recoil'd
[Page 152]

[275]   Yet all must be reveal'd, or worse ensues.                                          [He listens at the door of the cell.
Soft; 'tis his hour of slumber. Why that sound?
What do I hear? His deep groan strikes my ear:
And now a quick and agitated step
Rings on the echoing flints. Belov'd Petrowna!
All hope of bliss with thee is fled for ever.
Ivan must know his doom—Ivan—                                          [calling loudly to him. Ivan.
                                         Who summons? Narit. [unlocks the cell.]
Ah, hapless youth! the horrors of the day
Yet haunt thy soul, and from thy eyelids drive
Sleep's soothing balm. [Aside.] What then my charge accurst?
Why art thou silent? Speak— Ivan.
                                         Thy groans appal me.
Oh gaze not on me, so. Narit.
                                         Look on me, Ivan:
Thou art not wont to turn thine eye from mine. Ivan.
Thy glance, methinks, streams fire. Why, at this hour,
Say, what thy purpose? Yet I dread to hear.
Why dost thou start? Why turn thine eye around
As fearful of surprise? Narit.
                                         My heart is fraught
Beyond its bearing. I have kindly us'd thee:
Till now, beneath my rule, no word unkind
Has ever reach'd thee, Ivan. Ivan.
                                         Thou hast been
[300]   A friend, a father to me. Narit.
                                         How, how utter
[Page 153]

Words that hang curses on the tongue that speaks them?
Yet, all must be reveal'd, all clearly told.
Prepare to hear the vow that dooms this hand
To murder— Ivan.
                     Whom? Narit.
                     Thee, Ivan. Ivan.
                                         Thou, my father!
Thy hand to murder Ivan! Narit.
                                         I have vow'd
A terrible oath— Ivan.
                     I am prepar'd to die. Narit.
But I am not prepared to murder thee. Ivan.
Oh let me fling my arms around thy neck,
There breathe the love I owe thee— Narit.
                                         But, forgive me,
Deep is my guilt. Oh had it pleas'd high heav'n
Or ere thy birth, in mercy to have swept me
From off the living land, thou, at this hour,
King on thy throne had'st sway'd in righteousness
The sceptre of thy sires, and I had lain
In peace within the grave. Ivan.
                                         Come to my arms:
Once more embrace me. Narit. [starting from his embrace.]
[325]   What that sound? Ivan.
                                         I heard none— Narit. [half distracted with horror.]
A foot-step: ha! away! no earthly pow'r,
Shall force him hence.—Have I not sworn his death?
Hear, fiend of hell!
[Page 154]
Ivan.
                                         Thick-gathering drops of sweat
Fall from his brow— Narit.
                                         I heard it—hark, again
A foot-step. It speeds on. Hence, traitors, hence.
'Tis hush'd, and all is peace. Ivan.
                                         'Twas but the sound
Of the lone sentinel, or gusty night-breeze
Sweeping along the vaults. Narit.
                                         I must disclose it,
While yet my voice has pow'r—Ivan, 'tis sworn:
The solemn vow is ratified in heaven:
No, to a fiend my plighted soul is bound
That I will fix this dagger in thy heart
Ere mortal man shall triumph in thy rescue.
Yet, had I not so sworn, Rimuni's hand
Ere now had stabb'd thee. [the tower-clock strikes one.] What that sound? Ivan.
                                         The tow'r
Strikes one.                                          [Galvez rushes in. Gal.
                                         My lord, as tow'rds the east I gaz'd,
I saw a beacon on the topmost tow'r
[350]   Distinctly wave: then, suddenly it vanish'd,
And all was dark. Narit.
                                         Speed, speed, resume thy station:
Observe again what passes.                                          [As Galvez goes, a violent knocking is heard at the outside of Ivan's cell.
                                         Who thus knocks? Pet. [without.]
It is Petrowna; haste, unclose the cell—
Ivan, unclose the cell.
[Page 155]
Ivan.
                                         Conceal that dagger.
If thou must slay me,
At her departure, fear not Ivan's struggle:
My death-groan shall not reach Petrowna's ear. Pet. [without.]
Oh do not murder him! unclose the cell.
They come. On every side swift-gleaming lights
Flash to and fro— Narit. [opens the cell and catches her in his arms.]
Petrowna— Pet.
                                         Horror! horror!
Naritzin—Ivan—whither shall I turn?
I know thy horrid vow: the demon told it.
Come to me, Ivan.                                          [Galvez rushes in. Gal.
                                         Treason—I beheld
The beacon torch thrice wave.                                          [Ortosk rushes in. Ort.
                                         Come forth: arm'd men
Rush tow'rds the prisoner's cells. Narit.
                                         Ring out th'alarum;
Summon the guard. Petrowna to thy chamber.
[375]   Horror and death surround the cell. Away— Ivan.
If Ivan e'er was dear to thee, depart. Pet.
I stir not hence. A mother's love defends him,
My breast, his shield.                                          [The alarum rings, the tumult of the Conspirators is heard. Mir.
                                         Force down the iron draw-bridge!
Break, break the bars Rim. [without.]
                     Rescue to Ivan!— Cons. [without.]
                                         Rescue!
[Page 156]
Narit.
Not if this sword has pow'r—Galvez, come forth!
Soldier! desert me not. On, boldly on.                                          [they hurry out. Pet.
Naritzin! hear. Their multitude o'erpow'rs him,                                          [clash of arms.
They close him round on every side. Help, heav'n!                                          [The Conspirators, with torches in their hands, led on by Rimuni, Mirovitz, and Feodor, drive back Naritzin and his friends. Rim. [encountering Naritzin.]
Naritzin, 'tis Rimuni now defies thee. Narit. [defeats, and runs Rimuni through the body.]
So perish in thy guilt— Rim.
                                         Curse on thy arm.                                          [dies. Miro.
Ivan! come forth! 'Tis Mirovitz who calls you
To freedom, vengeance, empire. Narit. [draws his dagger, and stands over Ivan, in act to strike him.]
Never, never
[To Ivan.] Thou must not live. Back, traitors! or this dagger
Now strikes him dead. Pet.
                                         Oh do not shed his blood. Ivan. [to Narit.]
Dread not in me resistance. Miro. [to Feodor.]
Wrest the dagger
To the Conspirators.] Think of your oaths. Rescue your sovereign— Narit. [going to stab Ivan.]
                                         Never:
[400]   While I have being. Miro. [wrests the dagger from Naritzin, and is in act to slay him.]
                                         Die then.
[Page 157]
Pet. [seizing the arm of Mirovitz, kneels to Ivan.]
                                         Save him, Ivan—
Defend Petrowna's husband! Ivan. [to Petrowna.]
                                         Be at peace—
The wretched Ivan can no more sustain
The anguish of thy soul—Thus, thus, [snatches the dagger from Mirovitz, and stabs himself.]
                                         I end it—
Naritzin! none, save Ivan, could absolve thee
From that fell oath: no other arm could rescue
Those whom my soul most loves from ruthless vengeance.
Petrowna now will bless me: and, Naritzin,
Thou on thy death-bed may'st remember Ivan.
Support me, oh I faint. Miro. [presenting his sword to Narit.]
My hopes are blasted,
I seek not mercy: take my sword, Naritzin;
Death, instant death. Pet.
                                         Ivan, my son! look on me—
It is Petrowna's lip that breathes on thine. Ivan.
My sight grows dim, my hand hath lost its hold:
Support me: closer in thy arms enfold me!                                          [Petrowna clasps him in her arms. Pet.
Here, lay thy head. Ivan.
                                         'Tis sweet to breathe my last
On the sole spot where peace once dwelt with Ivan.                                          [He dies, Petrowna faints on him. Back matter

[Page 163]
Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A Court before the Temple of the Sun. An Altar before the gates of the Temple. Villoma. Vil.
God of my fathers! hear me.
Thou, thron'd on flame! Thou, at whose dawn, the world
Thy visible creation, bursts the veil
Of darkness, and in new-born life and lustre
Sees all that breathe, look up, and bless thy beams:
Hear my deep anguish! Now no more, my voice
Calls down, as once in happier years, thy ray,
Pure source of being, thro' the womb of earth
To stream fertility. No more, thy priest
Fresh gathering from the spring free tribute, lays
The prime of the year, of herb, and fruit, and flow'r
Nature's sweet offering on thy bloodless shrine.
Far other gifts I bring: receive these spoils,
That mournful on thy golden gates I hang,
[Page 164]

The lance, the helm, and buckler: while I call
On thee, once God of Peace, to arm thy sons
With dauntless fortitude. Let brave Zamorin
Again exultant from Pizarro's host
Return: and on thy heav'n-born child, sole heir
Of slain Huascar, here, in triumph fix
The crown that grac'd his sires on Cuzco's throne! Zama enters, kneels. Zama.
My sire! Vil.
                                         My Zama—
Oh may the blessing of a father's voice
[25]   Assuage thy grief! Zama.
                                         Yet—lives my husband? say—
Deceive me not: I think I could endure
From thee to hear his doom: let none less lov'd
Say to thy child, “Zamorin rests in death.” Vil.
How shall I answer thee? Zama.
                     Oh speak. Vil.
                                         His doom
Is yet unknown. Day after day, in vain
I claim the hostage. Zama.
                                         Ah! the foot that treads
Where the base Spaniard haunts, to Cuzco's walls
Shall never more return. Our word was sacred:
On the dread day mark'd out for Cuzco's woe,
This fort impregnable, yon gold-roof'd temple,
Gifts, and exhaustless wealth, and countless gems,
Offerings from kings thro' ages to their god,
Had grac'd Pizarro's triumph, if Peru,
[Page 165]

Regardless of the city of her god,
Fear'd to confront the Spaniard. Such the terms,
And famine forc'd compliance, when Pizarro
Proclaim'd by solemn oath, that fresh supplies
Should Cuzco's wants relieve, if brave Zamorin
Went forth the public hostage, pledg'd for Cuzco:
Yea, o'er his banner'd cross the Spaniard vow'd,
[50]   That, if Peru, ere that dread day, once more
Should arm her routed multitudes, Zamorin
Again should lead the battle. Thus allur'd
From Cuzco's walls the voluntary hostage
Went fearless forth. Vil.
                                         Yet vibrates on my heart
His farewell word. Zama.
                                         But, from that day, no succour
Has Cuzco's wants reliev'd, no voice has breath'd
Word of Zamorin. What avails it now,
That to defend the city of her god,
And free her far-fam'd chieftain, arm'd Peru
Her banner'd rainbow rears, and hosts on hosts
Fill all the plain? in vain. The perjur'd Spaniard
Basely detains the hostage: and Zamorin,
Whose brave resistance rous'd Peru, whose spirit
Glow'd thro' the mingled mass, whose arm alone
Could guide in war her multitudes, Zamorin,
Th'avenger of his country, 'mid yon host
Pines in base chains, or now, an untomb'd corse,
Feasts their vile dogs of carnage. Vil.
                                         Calm thy soul. Zama.
Hear me, my sire, nor fondly feign a hope
No longer felt.
[Page 166]

Now grant my only pray'r: let me go forth,
[75]   And learn Zamorin's fate. Vil.
                                         And wouldst thou leave
A father's arms, and Cuzco's hallow'd walls,
To rush amidst the riot, and flush'd camp
Of yon fell spoilers? Zama.
                                         To Zamorin's arms
I haste, to sooth his soul, or with him perish. Vil.
Urge not a vain request. Zama.
                                         Must then Zamorin,
Who went the public hostage, who reliev'd
The public woe, when famine and despair
Knelt to the foe for bread, mid ruthless men
Perish, of all abandon'd, far from Zama,
On whose responsive look his eye might dwell,
And while it swims in death's o'ershadowing mist,
Catch, ere it close for ever, the last solace
Of one fond tear? my father! by that name!
Oh by the memory of her who bore me,
Whose image, ne'er forgotten, lives in Zama,
Whose voice, ne'er heard in vain, speaks in thy heart
While her lov'd daughter pleads— Orcas suddenly enters. Vil.
                                         Why, Orcas, here?
Whence this intrusion? Orcas.
                                         Zeal to save thy life,
And Cuzco's tow'rs, and the sun's hallow'd temple
[100]   From spoil and profanation. Not alone
By the fell Spaniard, by her native sons,
Cuzco is doom'd to perish—
[Page 167]
Vil.
                     How? Orc.
                                         By treason. Vil.
Treason! Zama.
                     Oh horror! Orc.
                                         Since the perjur'd Spaniard,
Regardless of his vow, once more cut off
The scant supply, despair and swift revolt
Have spread from breast to breast. This day, ere dawn,
When wearied from my night-watch I return'd,
Thro' the thick mists that swept the mount, I saw
A fire-ball from the Spanish camp beneath
Flash forth, a second from the southern mound
Crost it in air: that was th'appointed signal.
A youth by horror struck and deep remorse,
Confest the crime. And, here, in that dark cavern
Where the sun ne'er sent down a beam, vile traitors
Leagu'd with Gulaxa— Vil. [interrupting him.]
Ha! that base usurper!
Whom fell Pizarro treacherously has lur'd
With Cuzco's promis'd crown? Orc.
                                         The same.—All know
His rank, how glorious once, an honour'd Inca,
[125]   Sprung of the sun's pure race, of royal blood:
But—from that day when captur'd by Pizarro,
The conqueror spar'd his life, the base Peruvian
Thro' fear, or fraud (what recks the worthless motive)
Worships the fell invader: so fame rumours:
And, in these walls, amid faint-hearted men
Dispirited by woe, his vaunted pow'r
And favour with Pizarro, each new day
[Page 168]

Gain him new followers. With that man, the traitors
Who, in their turn, this day the fortress guard,
Hold secret conference. Vil.
                                         What their fell intent? Orc.
To fix the hour, when to these hallow'd walls
Pizarro shall advance, and on this temple
Upraise his blood-stain'd banner. Vil.
                                         First, his steel
Shall pierce my bosom. Zama.
                                         First, the hallow'd stream
That warms this heart, a Coya's blood shall flow,
And on his brow the daughter of the sun
Draw down vindictive fire. Vil.
                                         Speed, Orcas, haste:
Summon the chosen chiefs that guard the temple:
And let the signal wave, and,—so deceiv'd—
The traitors join Gulaxa. I will meet him.
[150]   Tho' long adversity has bow'd the sons
Of Cuzco, tho' consuming famine slack'd
Their pithless joints, yet in these walls are men
Who in their heav'n-born monarch's righteous cause
Will gladly perish. Haste— Orc.
                                         Be such my death.                                          [Exit.                                          [Loud shouts and cries heard. Zama.
Whence that loud shout, those cries? Vil.
                                         'Tis now the time:
The guard at my command here lead the Spaniard.
Ne'er, till this day, have Cuzco's sons beheld
A Spanish chief in chains.
[Page 169]
Arcal rushes in. Shouts continued. Arc.
                                         Priest of the sun!
Speed forth, allay the tumult, aid the guard
O'erpow'r'd by numbers— One of the Guard rushing in. Guard.
                                         Holy father! haste,
Or Cuzco streams with blood. Vil.
                                         Zama, retire. Zama.
Retire! thy life in danger? come, my father.                                          [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Public Square. Peruvians contending with the Guard conducting Almagro in chains. Guard.
Drive, drive them back. 1 Per.
                                         Think of Peru's slain race. 2 Per. [to Almagro.]
Give me my son.                                          [Almagro in silence shows signs of pity and horror. 3 Per.
Where is my father's corse?
Scorn you to answer? you did rack his age
To sport your children, and your hounds lapp'd up
The life-blood as it spouted from his wounds— 1 Per.
[175]   Your goblets foam'd, and the feast shook with laughter
In mockery of our wounds; and when your captives
[Page 170]

Exhausted sunk, ye rous'd them to new life
By pangs unknown before. Peruvians.
                                         Force back the guard.
Perish, fell monster!                                          [Peruvians forcing Almagro from the overpowered Guard.] Guard.
                     Rescue him. Villoma, Zama, Arcal , enter. Vil.
                                         Peruvians. Per.
Strike, ere Villoma save him. Per.
                     Die. Vil.
                                         My children!
Have you no pity? have you chang'd your nature?
Oh spare him. Zama.
                                         Hear, Peruvians, know ye not
His voice who bids you spare. It is Villoma's.
Ye are his children, all— Per.
                                         Perish, fell monster— Zama. [rushing amid them in act to murder Almagro.]
Oh sun, withdraw thy light! murder in Cuzco
An unarm'd captive!—not on him—on me—
Here, on a Coya, daughter of your god,
Satiate your vengeance.                                          [They all fling down their weapons at Zama's feet. Alm.
                                         Lady! not for me
Hazard your life. Oh Spain! are these barbarians? Peruvians. [kneeling to Villoma.]
Forgive thy children! yet, oh holy father,
[Page 171]

Look down with eye of pity on our sufferings.
[200]   Resistance now is vain. Priest of the sun,
Resign the fort. Behold us bow'd to earth
With want, and woe, and famine. Vil.
                                         How resign it?
A solemn adjuration binds my soul
Ne'er to admit the Spaniard, till Zamorin
Here yields the fort, or, to confirm his will,
Sends back the hallow'd bracelet. Zama.
                                         Ne'er again
Shall Cuzco hail that consecrated chain.
Zamorin is no more. Alm.
                                         Nay, weep not, lady!
Zamorin yet is living. Zama.
                                         Living! Spaniard! Vil.
My sons, depart in peace. [they go.] Stranger! approach—
Learn from your foe to pity and protect
Him whom your pow'r can crush. Alm.
                                         Are these, barbarians?
They told me that Peruvians were at best,
Men but in shape; in soul, of brutal nature.
We Spaniards know you not. Vil.
                                         And who art thou
From whose astonish'd soul the voice of praise
Sounds like reproof? say, why hast thou assail'd
Basely this fortress, while thy perjur'd chief
[225]   Detains our hostage? Alm.
                                         Bid Pizarro answer:
This recks not me: I broke no sacred truce.
[Page 172]
Vil.
Your vows ye break at will: our word was sacred.
What but leagued treason urged you to assail
This rock in frantic insolence? Alm.
                                         My lance
Was met by valiant men. Vil.
                                         Presumptuous youth!
Declare the truth, nor let deceitful words
Draw righteous vengeance down. Alm.
                                         Cease thy vain threats:
I speak not at command. Vil.
                     Proud man! Zama.
                                         My father,
He looks like one whom gentleness may gain
More than harsh force compel. I pray thee, stranger!
Aught know'st thou of Zamorin? Alm.
                                         He yet lives—
So rumour speaks—but—by Pizarro, held,—
As I am—bound. Zama.
                                         A hostage! and in bonds!
Inhuman men. Alm.
                                         All are not such, fair lady! Vil.
Who art thou, and what urg'd thy rash assault? Alm.
[250]   A passion, haply, to Peru unknown:
Glory. Had conquest crown'd me, Spain had rank'd
Mine, with proud names, whose mention fires the soul,
Columbus, Cortez, and far-fam'd Pizarro.
Fair dames of proud Castille, at solemn jousts
Had wing'd their knights to victory, with the praise
[Page 173]

Of young Almagro: and, if here I perish
I have not sham'd my sire. Vil.
                                         Almagro's son,
Whose army fronts our warriors, while Pizarro
Encamps beneath these walls? Alm.
                                         Brief let me be.
Scarce had I landed on this coast, (few days
Now past) with men, and steeds, and warlike stores,
Trebling Pizarro's battle, when my sire,
Yet weak with uncur'd wounds, to me resign'd
His host, and high command. Thus, arm'd with pow'r
And due authority, I sought Pizarro,
With fair proposal, instantly to join
Our squadrons, and disperse your numbers— Vil. [interrupting him.]
                                         How!
Rash insolence of youth! captive, beware!
Look on those bonds. Alm.
                                         Your multitudes dispers'd,
Then, if that haughty chieftain yet disown'd
[275]   The signet that I bore, the Emperor's grant
Of Cuzco to my sire, to force compliance.
I came, Pizarro heard, and taunting, bade me
Fix on your rocks my flag; there crown Almagro:
And with bold impress charge my maiden shield,
Yet bloodless, and but prickt with tilting points.
He spake, and smil'd in scorn: my blood boil'd in me:
And forth I sallied where your host beheld me,
Ere yet my followers join'd, pois'd on my lance
Vault o'er the moat, and with adventurous grasp
From rock to rock climb up the craggy fort,
[Page 174]

And chase your warriors, till one daring chief
Seiz'd me unawares, and reckless of his life,
In the deep flood plung'd with me. More I know not.
You best can tell how rescu'd from the flood
You drew me forth, and when in swoon I lay,
What warriors stript an unresisting captive,
And thus enslav'd: you best can tell the death
That now awaits me. Vil.
                     Fear not— Alm.
                                         Fear! we Spaniards
Shrink not from death. Zama.
                                         Thy life redeems the hostage,
Almagro for Zamorin, chief for chief. Alm.
No—rather than consent to my release,
[300]   Pizarro, in thy sight, beneath these walls
Would stab the hostage. 'Tis not life I seek:
A Spanish chief in Cuzco manacled,
Almagro's son slav'd by Peruvian bonds,
Seeks but the consolation of the grave
To hide in death his shame. Yet—I will sue thee:
And bend the suppliant knee: a father's woe
Weighs on my heart. You are a man of mercy;
Send back my corse—my lance—a father's gift,
To old Almagro. It will soothe the warrior
To hang it o'er my tomb. And let your herald
Say, how I fought, how died— Zama. [flinging herself at Villoma's feet.]
Oh let me sue
For mercy. Such as he, in prime of life,
Zamorin: and each tear that falls for him,
Pleads for this captive youth. And haply too
[Page 175]

While on his doom we pause, and calmly weigh
What caution dictates, in his native land
One, sad as Zama, at the thought of war
Presses a bleeding heart, and mourns as dead,
Him yet alive. Vil.
                                         Zama, pronounce his doom. Zama.
Freedom. Zamorin's wife from bondage frees thee.                                          [Unclasping his chains. Alm.
Touch not these chains: I am a man disgrac'd. Zama.
What mean your words? Spaniard, the sons of Cuzco
[325]   Deem guilt, and not misfortune a disgrace.
Youth, thou art free: in victory's ruthless hour,
Remember Zama. To Pizarro go,
Say how Peruvian conquerors treat their captives,
So bid him treat his hostage. Alm.
                                         I will force him
To free the hostage, or no more Almagro
Will woo renown in arms, nor wield a lance
Where love and glory point the warrior's course.
Expect thy lord: my life for his is pledg'd.
Cuzco, ere night, shall view within her walls
Zamorin, or Almagro.                                          [Exeunt.

END OF ACT THE FIRST.

[Page 176]
ACT II. SCENE I. Pizarro's Camp beneath Cuzco. Pizarro. Piz.
Perish the Indian who resists Pizarro!
Perish, Zamorin! not to rouse defiance
I lur'd that chieftain hither. Had my threats
Or proffer'd realms avail'd, not Cuzco's tow'rs
And fruitful empire, but the western world
Had own'd me sovereign. In that Inca's soul,
Tho' mild and merciful, a firmness reigns
That knows not fear: but sooner at my bidding
Would Andes' rock on its eternal base
Than his calm spirit yield— Juan enters.
                                         My brother! Juan—
Hast thou succeeded? but—another day!—
And on that captur'd fort our chiefs shall grasp
Wealth boundless as their wish. Juan.
                                         Some I have gain'd,
Leaders of note: others, Almagro's gold
Heapt from far Chili, and rich realms between,
Has brib'd to quit thy standard: Chaves, Fernandez,
Haro, and dauntless Lerma.
[Page 177]
Piz.
                                         Dark-brow'd Lerma!
Almagro's golden ingots outweigh mine. Juan.
No. His stern spirit broods o'er fancied wrongs,
He has not smil'd since Cassamarca's fight.
I met him mid his squadron, near him stood
[25]   A herald from Almagro: at my offers
Th'indignant chieftain smil'd, and loud exclaim'd
That all might hear, “Base souls by gold are brib'd,
“Brave men by glory: from wrong'd Lerma's lip,
“Ere I depart, this day, your chief shall learn
“What gifts must gain a warrior.” Piz.
                                         Haughty spirit! Juan.
Your force is much diminish'd. Sixty horsemen:
Of pikes and cross-bows full an hundred gone.
Had not the flood, in which we saw him plung'd,
O'er young Almagro clos'd, and yonder signal
That sweeps the rocks confirm'd Gulaxa's word,
Despair had bow'd my spirit. Piz.
                                         On that Inca
My trust is fixt: and, if his art prevail,
This day, ere night-fall, yon rock-structur'd fort
By strength of mortal arm impregnable,
Shall at my summon's yield: and Cuzco's tow'rs,
Proud palaces, and mansions of delight,
Rich fanes, and gold-roof'd temples, pav'd with gems,
Wait my disposal. Then—the rebel chiefs
Who swell Almagro's numbers, at my feet
Shall prostrate fall, and shout Pizarro's name,
[Page 178]

While from yon battlements I view beneath me,
Day after day, Almagro's vaunted host
[50]   Perish without a blow. Herald enters. Her. [to Pizarro.]
My lord! the chiefs
Who faithful to your banner yet remain,
Now claim your presence. Piz.
                                         Claim it! [after deliberation.] —Bring Zamorin,
Th'unyielding Inca, where my chiefs in council
Shall mark his dreadful doom. [Herald goes.] This will, methinks,
Sooth them awhile, ere conquest on yon walls
Waves my proud banner. Juan—thou attend.                                          [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Tent of the Chiefs in Council. Alvarados, Benalcazar , Spanish Chiefs. Alv.
Comrades! be firm. Brave Benalcazar, hear me.
I grant our loss is heavy, Chaves, Fernandez,
Haro, and valiant Lerma: chiefs of proof:
Men of wise voice in council, and whose arm
Chain'd victory to their standard. They are gone:
And we have cause for grief, none for despair,
If we who yet are left, view not each other
[Page 179]

With that cold eye of timorous distrust,
That ill befits a soldier.                                          [Towards the conclusion of this speech, Pizarro enters, and takes his seat as Chief of the Council. After long silence, Pizarro rises.] Piz.
                                         Why thus silent?
Let none despair. Time was, fame-honour'd chiefs!
When by pale fear, and woe, and want encircled,
On a lone island near this coast I drew
Thus, with my sword, a line: “Behold (I said)
“On this side, danger and immortal glory:
“There, safety and dishonour.” Blush, Castile!
[75]   All, all but thirteen warriors, left Pizarro.
There, the heav'n-destin'd conquerors of Peru
Month after month obscurely lay conceal'd,
And glory knew us not: but, when our foot
Once trod upon this coast, our second step
Tow'r'd on the neck of monarchs. Alv.
                                         On this sword
I laid, in pledge of faith, a soldier's hand,
Ere victory blazing round Pizarro's brow
Had lur'd the fickle noon-swarm. The bright sun
Allur'd not me, nor shall the storm appal.
Pizarro's cause is mine: and may this arm
Wither in battle, when I turn my lance
Against his helm. Piz.
                                         Brave chief, behold this gem:
'Twas king Ataliba's: he died, and left us
Heir to his wealth. Take, and transmit this jewel
[Page 180]

To thy son's sons, to late posterity,
As a memorial that Pizarro knew
Thy worth, nor lightly honour'd it. Herald enters. Her.
                                         My lord,
The hostage waits thy will. Piz.
                                         Bring him before us.                                          [Herald goes.
Your well-weigh'd voice—I am but one among you—
Shall fix his doom. Alv.
[100]                                            Fain would I, front to front
Behold him. Since that hard-contested battle
When singly he assail'd me, as I slew
His routed host, I ne'er have seen that warrior.
You still refus'd me. Piz.
                                         I had ever hope
So to have sway'd him, that his soul had bow'd
Submissive to your will: my threats avail'd not.
Yet—I have witness'd men who boldly brav'd
A single front, turn pale and quake at sight
Of chiefs in council. Herald enters with Zamorin . Alv.
                                         In his air and form
Reigns simple grandeur, and on that calm front
I trace the visible impress of a mind
That yields not to base fear.                                          [Zamorin regardless of the Council, unclasps a bracelet, and crushes it, link after link. Zam. [to himself.]
                                         Oh sacred charge!
[Page 181]

Pledge of a monarch's love, a nation's trust,
Farewell for ever.                                          [Kisses it. Alv.
                                         Why, Peruvian, thus
Unclasp that bracelet from thy arm, why rend it
Link after link? Zam. [to himself.]
Not their unhallow'd hands:
Their touch shall not pollute thee. So, [crushing it.] escape
Their sacrilegious avarice—nor—perhaps—
Attest Zamorin's frailty. Alv.
[125]                                            Peruvian!
We are not by your spoils so lur'd, so slav'd
By every glittering toy, that we had stript thee
Of that poor ornament. Brave Inca, say,
Why dost thou tread that bauble under foot? Zam.
I'll answer thee, when it is crush'd to atoms.
Say. [To Pizarro.] Have I leave to speak? Piz.
                                         We Spaniards, Inca,
Do not condemn our prisoners unheard. Zam.
Man, man, thou mock'st me. Look, where thou art thron'd,
Look, where I stand. And hast thou heart to mock me? Alv.
Thou shalt have patient hearing. Piz.
                                         We attend. Zam.
It ever hath been custom with our kings,
From great Huana Capac, our first monarch,
The offspring of the sun, when they select
A leader of their forces, round his arm
To bind the chain which in the hour of peace
Circles their neck: that bracelet, linkt by hands
[Page 182]

Celestial, all Peru so sacred deems,
That Cuzco's chiefs beholding it would yield
The city, and the temple of their god.
Who bears that bracelet, speaks, and is obey'd
Like one from heav'n. No eye shall see it more;
'Tis crush'd to atoms. Alv.
[150]                        Wherefore? Zam.
                                         I receiv'd it
From good Huascar, on the very night
He perish'd, by the fell usurper slain,
Sent by Ataliba, whom you did murder.                                          [The Council murmurs enraged. Ben.
To torture with him. Zam.
                                         Whence this sudden rage? Ben.
Away with him. Zam.
                                         In what have I offended?
Or can you not in patience hear the deed
That you had heart to act? Alv.
                                         Hear, hear him, comrades!
The language of plain truth, howe'er it gall me,
Is not unwelcome to a soldier's ear.
On with your speech. You shall not interrupt him. Zam.
When I came forth your hostage, not your prisoner,
I charg'd Villoma to refuse all terms
If by that chain unvouch'd; for I had heard
That ye had instruments of hellish pow'r
To force the tongue to utterance: now to feign
What the soul knew was false, and now deny
The truth that is our birthright from above.
I never shrunk, as these deep scars may witness,
[Page 183]

From wounds in war, but what ye might inflict
When cool the blood, I knew not. This I know,
[175]   That man is frail: and doubts, yea—fears came o'er me,
Lest in the heart here bosom'd, human frailty
Might underneath the agony of torture,
Betray its weakness. Ben.
                                         Then bid yonder fort
Instantly yield, or the keen rack shall goad
Your quivering limbs. Zam.
                                         I now can stand the trial:
For what the tongue may rave when nature groans
In madd'ning torture, now has no avail.
The chain is crush'd. Gulaxa enters in haste. Piz.
                     Gulaxa! Gul.
                                         Brave Pizarro,
Art thou prepar'd to lead thy host in arms,
When I advance the signal? Piz.
                                         Yes. Go forth—
And reign at Cuzco. Zam.
                                         Reign! no—base usurper. Piz.
Pizarro crowns him. Zam.
                                         On his brow your hand
May fix a crown: but you are strangers to us.
'Tis not the diadem that awes our souls,
Peru reveres her father in her king:
Our's is the heart's pure homage. Gul.
                                         Hear, Zamorin.
[Page 184]

[200]   Cuzco obeys my signal: yet—I know
There are within yon fort who still resist.
Alone thy influence sways them: bid them yield:
Enough of blood has stream'd. They who oppose me,
Shall surely die. Zam.
                                         I pity whom thou spar'st. Gul.
Think that thou view'st Villoma prone on earth,
His grey hairs stain'd with gore: think on thy Zama,
When ruthless war unchains his triple fiends,
Rapine, and Lust, and Murder. Zam.
                                         Lord of Nature!
Who in yon orb of living light, to earth,
Faint shadowest forth thy glory: pow'r supreme!
Who for high ends to man unsearchable,
Send'st forth thy dreadful ministers of vengeance,
Tempest and spotted plague, and flame-wing'd bolts;
And now, along the violated deep
Hast sent, more fell than tempest, plague, and fire,
From other worlds, the outcast of mankind
To waste this realm: to thee, oh Sun! I call:
And join my voice to that which mute to man,
Pleads audibly in heav'n and in each drop
Of innocent blood, spilt upon earth, draws down
Dire retribution on the murderer's brow.
Hence—murderer!                                          [Gulaxa departs. As he goes loud shouts are heard. Voices without.]
[225]   Almagro. Hail—Almagro.
[Page 185]
Herald enters. Her. [to Pizarro.]
My lord—Almagro's son, on foaming steed,
Speeds thro' your camp: with him his far-fam'd leaders,
Herrada, Garcias, and renown'd Orgognez.
And—from your squadrons, many a fickle soldier
Gathers around them. Hark! [shouts heard.] the air resounds
With shouts of young Almagro. Piz.
                                         Chiefs, be firm—
On you Pizarro rests: and plunder'd Cuzco
Shall all your toils o'erpay— Amid shouts of Almagro—Young Almagro, Herrada, Garcias , and Orgognez , enter.
                                         Ha! who art thou?
Art thou a spirit risen from the dead,
To haunt me at mid-day? Alm.
                                         None from the dead.
Herrada! stay with me: go, trusty Garcias,
Haste to my sire: relate what here has past.
Orgognez, ere three hours have wing'd their flight,
Be it thy charge to lead my chosen squadrons
To storm this camp, if yet Pizarro brave us.                                          [Orgognez and Garcias depart.
[To Pizarro's Council.] Are these the chiefs whom terror chain'd to earth,
[Page 186]

When o'er the fosse I sprung, and scal'd the rock?
And slept your swords when one of Spanish blood
Sunk in your sight? Alv.
                                         The sword and lance were pow'rless
Gainst that proud fort where our good cannon fail'd.
[250]   But—when I saw thee mid surrounding foes
Rush singly unappall'd, old Alvarados
Heard on his back war's iron harness ring.
Methought in each old scar the whizzing shaft
Sunk, as when first it pierc'd me. Alm.
                                         Hear, Pizarro—
Dismiss thy chiefs: let us confer in secret. Piz.
Retire awhile, my friends.                                          [The Chiefs depart. Alm. [staying Zamorin.]
                                         Is this the hostage? Zam.
You see Zamorin. Alm.
                                         Go not hence, brave man.
Thro' me thy Zama greets thee. Zam.
                                         Name her not:
The very sound unmans me. Zama, Zama,
Oh may'st thou never hear what I have suffer'd! Alm. [to Pizarro.]
Tho' thou resist my sire's just claim, and mock
The Emperor's sacred signet— Piz. [interrupting him.]
                                         Heav'n forefend! Alm.
Yet we may meet on terms: and, in that hope,
Before thy warriors I reproach'd thee not,
But face to face here breathe my just rebuke.
Yet know I to forgive, and once aton'd,
Remember not th'offense.
[Page 187]
Piz.
                                         Then—we are friends.
Declare the terms. Alm.
[275]                        First, free this hostage. Zam.
                                         Me?
Spaniard! art thou aware of thy demand? Piz.
Why free this man, alike thy foe and mine? Alm.
Their fortress I assail'd, they spar'd my life;
The sire of this brave man unclasp'd my chains,
The wife of this brave man spake comfort to me,
And when I seem'd in sorrow, look'd on me
As one who views a brother. Zam.
                                         Zama saw
Distress, nor ask'd when misery pierc'd her soul,
Whether a friend or foe requir'd relief:
'Twas human nature suffer'd, Zama pitied.
Spaniard, beneath our roof, in Cuzco's walls,
The life of man is sacred. Piz. [to Almagro.]
                                         You did promise
To free this chief. Alm.
                                         My life for his is pledg'd. Piz.
Say, we release him, you require no more. Alm.
Nought, but our right, the Emperor's grant. Juan enters. Juan.
                                         Pizarro,
The beck'ning signal waves from yonder fort.
Shall I array the troops? Piz.
                                         Haste, quickly arm them.
I, I will lead them.                                          [Juan goes. Alm.
[300]                                            Trust not to that signal.
[Page 188]
Piz.
You plead the Emperor's grant! behold my title,
Not penn'd in characters that man can forge,
Make and unmake at will. [Takes his helmet off.] 'Tis charter'd here,
Imprinted by the iron hand of war,
On this time-furrow'd front: and till thy sword
Has raz'd it out, look not to rule at Cuzco.
Each dent, and honour'd scar that seams this head,
Will yawn afresh, wide as when first the blood
Gush'd from the wound, whene'er Pizarro yields
What conquest gave him on the well-fought field.
Here ends our conference. Guard! confine this Indian.

END OF ACT THE SECOND.

[Page 189]
ACT III. SCENE I. The Court before the Temple of the Sun. Villoma and Zama . Zama.
Oh! go not forth; to others trust the charge:
'Tis not a woman's fear: each voice reports
Signs of dire portent. Vil.
                                         Earth has rock'd ere now,
And red volcanos roar'd— Zama.
                                         Not these alone,
Nor lakes that heav'd when not a light leaf wav'd,
Nor fiery armies clanging in the skies:
But from the southern turret one who watch'd
Last night—                                          [Priests burst in. Priest.
                     Hear, hear, Villoma— Vil.
                                         Why thus burst
Unbidden? Wherefore shake thy limbs? Priest.
                                         Good father! Vil.
Speak, holy man— Priest.
                                         It was our charge this day,
To watch the heav'ns: noon's solemn hour drew near,
When, as we gaz'd observant of the God,
To hymn his mid-day pomp, at once from view,
While not a cloud obscur'd the golden sky,
[Page 190]

The sun withdrew his light: and wide o'er heav'n
From the dark orb thick gathering vapours spread
Ceaselessly streaming. As our hearts died in us—
Oh horror! Vil.
[25]                        Speak— Priest.
                                         The temple's ponderous gates
Mov'd by an unseen hand, and dreadful groans,
As from a struggling spirit loath to part,
Burst from the riven shrine— Zama.
                                         These, these are sent
Dire warnings from above. Oh, go not forth. Vil.
At this dread hour when treason shakes the realm,
And brother against brother arms his hand,
I will not to another trust that charge
Which duty binds on me. The will of heaven,
More audible than prodigies and portents,
Bids me defend my country. Orcas enters. Orc.
                                         Haste, Villoma!
The secret signal floats above the rock:
Now, mid the traitors, in the cavern's gloom
Where the sun never shone, Gulaxa leagues
The murderous band. Vil.
                                         Say, are th'appointed guard
Drawn forth, and well advis'd? Orc.
                                         They wait thy word,
And call on thee to lead them.                                          [Orcas goes. Vil.
                                         Say, I come—
[Page 191]

Thou, if this hand, oh Sun, that clasps thy shrine,
Has ne'er from youth to age been rais'd to thee
[50]   But to invoke from heav'n, on all beneath,
Thy universal blessings, hear my pray'r!
Accept this life, a sacrifice for all!
Strike here, and save thy realm!—My child, farewell! Zama.
I will not leave thee at this dreadful hour:
Zamorin's wife has sway among the chiefs,
Zamorin's spirit breath'd in softer tone,
E'en in a woman's voice has pow'r to daunt
The soul of guilt. Vil.
                                         Think of thy boding fears— Zama.
I have no fear: thy life, thy life's in danger.                                          [Exeunt. Scene, a Cave. Gulaxa, Rimac , Conspirators. Gul.
Your stations are assign'd, and ye have sworn
What time Pizarro's trumpet rends the air
To yield the fortress— Rim.
                                         Yes, 'tis sworn, Gulaxa,
But where is Arcal? Gul.
                                         On the middle rampire
That skirts the ledge of rocks, his eye o'erlooks
The Spanish camp. Rim.
                                         Trust not that man, Gulaxa:
His life, methinks, is bosom'd in Villoma,
That he so fears to wound him—
[Page 192]
Villoma, Zama, Orcas , Guard, burst in. Vil.
                                         Seize their weapons. Rim.
No—not if this avail. Zama. [catching his lifted hand.]
Here, traitor! strike.—
[75]   A daughter's hand has sav'd thee.                                          [To Villoma. Vil.
                                         Drag them forth,
Drag forth these serpents from their darksome cave:
Th'all seeing sun shall glare upon their shame.                                          [They drag them forth.
Traitors, your doom is death. Kneel not to me.                                          [To Gulaxa.
I cannot pardon thee. Gul.
                                         Nor do I ask it,
But on such terms as shall redeem my soul
From galling infamy. I boldly claim
Not mercy, but high praise, and just reward
Due to a deed that to remotest time
Shall consecrate my memory. Vil.
                                         Say on. Gul.
The signal waves; the Spaniards soon will march:
I know the impatience of Pizarro's soul:
That chief will lead them. At the lower fort
Fix me to guide his foot-step up the rock:
Then, ere he cross the outward bridge, this hand
Shall pierce his breast. Zama.
                                         Oh more than serpent fell,
He only wounds, instinctively, in rage,
[Page 193]

The foot that bruises him: but thou, oh man!
Thou with deliberate thought, pondering the means,
Would'st stab the friend who leans upon thy breast,
And fell him with thy hand, held forth in act
[100]   Of seeming kindness. Vil.
                                         And for this thou claim'st
Praise and reward: such recompense as suits
Such actions, be thy meed. When guilt, like thine,
Stalks forth unpunish'd, he who pardons it
Incurs the wrath of heav'n. Thy doom is death. Orc. [looking out.]
Almagro's son, who left this morn our walls,
Returns—and with him—one— Zama.
                                         Perhaps—Zamorin. Vil. [To Orcas who goes out.]
Conduct them hither. Oh! all gracious heav'n!
Thro' dark and intricate mazes hid from man
Thy mercy lightens, as the golden sun
Bursts from the veil of clouds. Orcas enters, conducting Almagro and Herrada . Zama.
                                         It is not—no—
'Tis not Zamorin. Why that look of woe?                                          [To Almagro.
Why art thou silent? oh! he is no more. Alm.
I left him living: but—you see me here— Zama.
I understand you. He will not live long. Alm.
I left him at the mercy of Pizarro.
Oh, if thou wish to hear his last farewell,
Or see him more, away: this chief [Herrada.] shall guard thee.
[Page 194]

Rely on him, as on this willing victim,
Pledg'd for Zamorin's life. Gul. [as Zama is rushing out.]
Stay, Zama, stay!
But grant me life, [to Villoma.] and I will mark the means
[125]   To free the hostage. To her heart again
Zama shall clasp her lord. Vil.
                                         Speak—thou art pardon'd. Gul. [pointing to Almagro.]
Lo, in this chief, Pizarro's fellest foe:
The wish most harbour'd in Pizarro's heart,
Is this man's death: haste, proffer in exchange
His corse, and hail Zamorin. Zama.
                                         No—fell traitor!
First, let Zamorin die, and with him, Zama.
[To Herrada.] Spaniard! in thee I trust. My sire—farewell.                                          [Zama rushes out, accompanied by Herrada. Vil.
Haste, haste, restrain her flight—my daughter: Zama!
Perfidious murderer! [to Gulaxa.] No. Thou shalt not die:
It now were mercy. When Pizarro, swol'n
With pride of promis'd victory, leads his host
Against this fort, and summons forth his slaves,
Then—to confound the conqueror, cast before him
This traitor—chain'd. So in thy doom, that chief
Shall dread his destiny.
                                         [To Orcas.] Be this thy charge.                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 195]
Scene changes to Pizarro's Camp. Pizarro comes from his Tent, at the sound of Trumpets at a distance. Piz.
Here will I cross their march—
                                         By Saint Iago,
Would that smooth sounds, or words of lofty tone
Might cool these fiery spirits! 'till yon rock
Barr'd my free progress, their resistless course
Swept o'er Peru, from realm to conquer'd realm,
[150]   Following from the east on Victory's eagle wing
The sun, that like a harbinger before us,
Lit our long march of glory. [a trumpet.] Hark—a trumpet!
The sound of men in arms. Lerma and his Host enter Ler.
                     Pizarro. Piz.
                                         Lerma! Ler.
Pedro de Lerma. [lifting up his vizor.] Look upon him. Halt!
Comrades in arms! Piz.
                                         Brave warrior! at this hour
Why cas'd in steel with these thy valiant men?
No herald summon'd thee. Ler.
                                         I march, Pizarro,
To join Almagro's standard. Some have fled
Like men, guilt-sham'd, as if they fear'd thy frown.
[Page 196]

I come, as chief meets chief, as foe fronts foe,
To say that thou hast wrong'd me. Piz.
                                         No—brave warrior. Ler.
How. Thou remember'st not? The injurer
Can smile on whom he wrong'd, and calmly tender
His hand in pledge of friendship! Say, Pizarro,
Hast thou forgot the memorable day,
When swol'n by autumn floods, th'Apurimac
Barr'd our pursuit? when, on its crags, your host
Shrunk back, and nought was heard, when paus'd the gust,
But the flood's ceaseless roar, who, foremost, spurr'd
[175]   His steed careering on the pendulous bridge,
Which, o'er the torrent, wreath'd from rock to rock,
Shook its light net-work waving with each wind? Piz.
'Tis fresh in my remembrance. Valiant Lerma,
Thy steed first cross'd it. Ler.
                                         You remember that!
Then—when the Indians ambush'd 'mid the cliffs,
Fell on our struggling rear, you bad Henriquez
Charge with the lances. Was not that my post? Piz.
I saw thee not. Ler.
                                         The routed Indians saw me,
Who hemm'd Alvarez round: I rescued him:
And heard, at my return, Henriquez' name
Echoed from rank to rank. Piz.
                                         Forget th'offence.
Since then long time has past, and Lerma's merits
Have not been unrewarded. Ler.
                                         Years on years
[Page 197]

Heal not the wound where injur'd honour bled;
Once felt, and ne'er forgotten. So, farewell.
You know this raven plume, that oft in fight
Has wing'd your troops to victory: Pizarro,
Avoid it, and beware of Lerma wrong'd! Piz.
Farewell, stern Lerma, nor forget this blade
When it unplumes thy helm. Avoid Pizarro!                                          [They part different ways. Scene changes to another part of Pizarro's Camp. Zamorin. Zam.
[200]   The stir and shout of the tumultuous camp
Loud ring from tent to tent: ere-long yon fort,
Impregnable by pow'r of mortal arm,
Shall yield its strength, and treason ope its gates
At stern Pizarro's voice. Oh heav'n-born babe!
Sole relic of the race sent down to earth
To bless this realm! no more my arm shall guard thee.
Villoma—Zama—hold my madd'ning brain!
Not that—not that—no—the fixt earth shall first
Fall from it shatter'd base: and thou, oh Sun,
Rush from thy sphere, ere guilt's foul touch pollute
Her pure and sinless bosom.                                          [Juan's voice heard without. Juan.
                                         When the trumpet
Summons the warriors, to Pizarro lead them:
Now strictly guard the tent: let none approach.
[Page 198]
Zama speaks in entering.
Zamorin! Zam.
'Tis her voice. It cannot be.
Once, once again charm'd Fancy! breathe that sound! Zama. [embracing him.]
Zamorin. Zam.
'Tis herself—angel of light. Zama.
Yet, yet thou liv'st, and these fond arms enfold thee.
Oh I had fear that never, never more
This eye had gaz'd on thine. Zam.
                                         Yes—I will clasp thee,
And, ere we part, in thy celestial look
[225]   Taste the pure transport of a world, where love
'Mid spirits of the blest, links soul with soul
In everlasting union. Yet—my Zama!
I would we had not met. Zama.
                                         Oh say not that! Zam.
Why gaze thus on me with unsated eye? Zama.
Oh! thou art strangely alter'd, since we parted.
A few, few days. Keen grief has wrung thy soul,
And each worn feature, as I gaze on thee,
Wounds me with mute reproach. Had I been here,
Thou had'st less keenly suffer'd. Zam.
                                         That alone,
I had but that alone to sooth my anguish:
Thou knew'st it not— Zama.
                                         Yet, sure, had I been here,
[Page 199]

Thy soul, tho' pierced with anguish, had found peace
While pillow'd on my breast thy brow repos'd.
And I had watch'd thy sleep, and if my tears
Shed in mute wretchedness, had chanc'd to stray
Down thy pale cheek, my lip had kiss'd them off,
And met thee with a smile. Zam.
                                         The past, oh Zama!
Wakes not a pang. Would thou wert now away! Zama.
Never, Zamorin, will I leave thee more:
None, none shall part us. Thou wert once unkind,
[250]   Yet was it kindly meant! but never more
Force me to quit thee: nor dissolve the dream
So sweet, of hope, that whispers to my soul
That I may sooth thy grief. Alas! Zamorin,
You hid from me the woe that nature suffers,
But left me to the nameless agonies
Of fear's unreal shapings. Yet—my husband— Zam.
Why that dread silence? Speak thy inmost wish. Zama.
The fond indulgence of a woman's weakness
Must not unman thee: these are ruthless men;
And, if thou deem, that death's unpitied pangs
Will less severely wound thee, if thy Zama
Be far away: I, now, tho' loth, will leave thee.
And, yet, mid these rude men, whose brutal rage
Ends not with life— Zam.
                                         Cease, cease: you wring my heart. Zama.
To leave thy untomb'd corse expos'd to scorn
[Page 200]

And insults that the tongue wants strength to utter!
Oh by that love which made this earth a heav'n,
By the blest vow that made us one, refuse not
My last request!— Zam.
                                         I was prepar'd for death:
Thou hast unman'd me: 'tis for thee I fear. Zama.
Thou weep'st, nor longer can'st deny my pray'r:
'Tis what religion prompts, and these bad men,
[275]   Unhallow'd as they are, will not refuse it.
'Tis but to close the eye which cannot see
The hand that weighs it down, and smooth the brow
Insensate to the touch which presses it.
Nor will they envy me a little spot
Where I may hide thee in the grave, and pour
O'er thy cold corse a pray'r, while death steals o'er
The lip that breathes farewell.                                          [Trumpet sounds. Zam.
                                         Hark! that dread signal! Juan enters with a Guard. Juan.
Bring the Peruvians forth. Zam.
                                         Art thou prepar'd,
My Zama? Zama.
Yes, Zamorin, thus— [embraces him.] to perish,
And hail the stroke that shall in death unite us.

[Page 201]
ACT IV. SCENE I. The Fort of Cuzco. Pizarro, Alvarados, Benalcazar, Zamorin, Zama . Soldiers arrayed. Piz.
Comrades in arms!
Who here have watch'd, while through each labouring change
The cold moon slowly toil'd, and at the base
Of these vast rocks, seen the red balls ye launch'd
Fall from the unscath'd fortress! Ye, whom war,
By irksome trials in the lingering seige
Has taught to bear the iron yoke that galls
Proud valour, while your spirit glow'd within you,
Like the train'd war-steed, balancing his pace
While his eye flames with fire; lo, there your spoils!                                          [Pointing to the Fort.
Drag from unfathom'd caves exhaustless wealth,
And jems that pale the noon-beam: on yon height
Repose, and one by one tell o'er your scars:
And where the arrow pierc'd your batter'd mail,
Close it with plates of gold— Ben.
Now, give the signal—
Thy troops demand the spoil. Piz.
                                         O'er yon proud temple
When victory waves my banner, Benalcazar,
[Page 202]

Fix on the battlement this Inca's head,
So shall they perish, all who stood before us
Barring our way to conquest. Zama.
                                         Man of blood—
All— [going to the different chiefs.] are ye all alike?
[25]      Thou aged warrior, [to Alvarados.]
Whose silver beard shows like my father's! spare him! Zam.
Zama! submit in silence. Piz. [to his herald.]
                                         Sound the trumpet.
Summon the fortress. Alv.
                                         First, Pizarro, hear me—
This corselet bears the dint of many a wound
That bought thee conquest: gold and gems I ask not.
I claim his freedom. Zama.
                                         Thou wert born of woman,
And drops of pity mingled in the breast
That gave thee milk. Alv. [to Zama.]
Hang not around me, thus;
Mine is no heart of flint: since she who bore me,
Wept o'er her farewell blessing, this old cheek
Has never felt a tear: the drops would scald
My eye unwonted to them— Ben.
                                         Hear, Pizarro,
Our followers murmur at this long delay— Alv. [to Ben.]
When Alvarados speaks, he will be heard—
In the last action, when his army fled,
I found this Inca with the fight o'erdone
Stretch'd on a heap, Indians and Spaniards slain.
[Page 203]

I bad him yield: he answer'd not, but swiftly
As one just fresh in onset, wrench'd my lance
[50]   From its firm rest: and, as I grasp'd my sword,
With my own weapon, thro' this iron gauntlet,
Thus, pierc'd me: and may venom lurk in the wound,
If Alvarados see him basely slain
As he had ne'er known valour. Zama. [kisses his hand.]
                                         Zama's lip
Shall head the wound— Piz. [to Alv.]
                                         Pizarro is thy debtor.
When the proud fortress yields, release the hostage.
Summon the place— Zam. [advancing.]
Pizarro, stay—That fort
Hangs on my word: be warn'd, and now release me:
Or rage will prompt strange deeds, which shall outlast
The fame that waits on victory—Peru
Once more in arms demands her chief: release him,
Him whom you cannot fear— Ben.
                                         Free him, Pizarro—
Our scanty band scatters at will their myriads
Like dust before the blast— Zam.
                                         Boast not, proud warrior!
We are not cas'd in mail, we forge not swords
Edg'd to cut steel, we launch not hidden fires
That flash, and man is dead, nor mount on steeds
That crush the foe beneath their iron hoof—
We fight, as nature dictates: ye are train'd
[75]   To slaughter as an art: and in mid fight
Ye speak, and are obey'd, and turn the tide
[Page 204]

Of battle with a word. But, with our shields
Twin'd rushes of the brook, reed shafts, and spears
Unbarb'd with iron, and for high-plum'd casque
A wreath of flow'rs pluck'd from our native soil,
Arm'd in our country's cause, we will once more
Front you without a fear— Ben. [to Piz.]
                                         These valiant men
Have earn'd rewards beyond a monarch's ransom,
And claim the promis'd spoil. We come not hither
Thus to be mock'd by slaves. Piz.
                                         Draw your brave swords,
Wave your triumphant standards, peal the trumpet.
Yield to Pizarro's power! Orc. [on the battlement.]
Where is the chief
Who thrones and unthrones kings? Piz. [advancing.]
                                         Behold Pizarro— Orc. [to the guards within the fort.]
Now cast the traitor forth, then, close the gates.                                          [Gulaxa is cast forth. He kneels to Pizarro. Ben.
This is no harbinger of victory. Alv. [to Gul.]
Why dost thou clasp his knees? why prone on earth
Thus shrouded close from view, as if thou fear'd'st
That the abhorrent eye should turn from thee
As from a sight unblest? Zam.
                                         Is this the monarch
[100]   Whom great Pizarro crown'd? Piz.
                                         Ye mountains! crush me!
Gape earth that I have drench'd with blood, and hide me
In central night!
[Page 205]
Ben. [to Pizarro.]
Where are the promis'd spoils? Piz. [confusedly to his army.]
This is not as it seems. It moves your wonder.
Be not alarm'd, my friends: art oft beneath
The semblance of repulse—Oh heav'n and earth!
By all my former fame, and the proud hope
Of greater glory, now for ever gone,
Thou [to Gulaxa.] shalt not live.                                          [Going to stab him. Gul.
                                         Stay thy impetuous hand:
I was myself betray'd. Send back your troops.
Yet, yet thou shalt succeed. Piz.
                                         Comrades! retire
A little while: here soon to meet again.
I pray you to the camp.                                          [All go but Pizarro, Juan, and Gulaxa. Gul.
                                         Grant me but life,
Villoma shall obey me. Piz.
                                         Mark me, traitor,
Oh—if false hope deceive me, thou shalt die
In lingering agonies. There, fix my banners,
Now, ere Almagro's swift advancing host
Pluck conquest from my grasp. Gul.
                                         'Tis in thy pow'r. Piz.
[125]   No trifle turns Pizarro from his course. Gul.
You need but feign the act. Piz.
                                         Be brief—reveal it— Gul.
You mark'd that woman whom they lead away. Piz.
Most beautiful. In form, and face, and air,
Peerless, and rarely grac'd.
[Page 206]
Gul.
                                         You know her rank. Piz.
Zamorin's wife. Gul.
                     Know you nought else? Zam.
                                         No more. Gul.
She is a daughter of the sun: a Coya. Piz. [impatiently.]
Well, well. Gul.
                                         You heed me not. She is a Coya.
Pure in her veins, from our first monarch, flows
Her blood by mortal mixture unprofan'd.
Her father, in yon rock-built temple, serves
The sun, his sire and god,—her life is sacred—
You understand me: let me add no more. Piz.
Her life is sacred. I have heard such tales;
But these vain dreams and visions of weak fancies,
Past with the hearing. Gul.
                                         Oh you misconceive it:
So sacred are their lives, that he who wounds them
Unknowingly, nay, tho' devoid of sense,
Idiot or lunatic, no longer dwells
[150]   With man, but from the social tie cut off,
Strays lone on earth, amid the beasts of the wild.
Who slays a Coya, is entomb'd alive,
His race from earth swept off, and e'en the ground
That fed him, hid with stones, which he who passes,
Casts with a curse upon it. Piz.
                                         Then—you mean
That I should slay this daughter of the sun,
If her stern sire refuse to yield the fort. Gul.
You need but threaten it. But ne'er Villoma
Will yield the fort, unsanction'd by Zamorin.
A solemn vow restricts him. Free the hostage:
[Page 207]

Let him once more to Cuzco's walls return;
And when Villoma and Zamorin view
The Coya in thy pow'r— Piz. [interrupting him.]
It cannot fail—
Juan—delay not—to Zamorin haste;
Release the hostage: this the sole condition,
That young Almagro in yon walls remain
A captive: here, with us, the Coya rests,
Pledge of Zamorin's words. [Juan goes.] Guards! seize this traitor, [Gulaxa.]
And underneath yon rock that view'd our shame,
In torturing pangs inflict his doom of death.                                          [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Camp. Zamorin and Zama . Zam.
Oh hapless country! by thy native race
Betray'd to merciless men! Zama.
[175]                                            Yet some remain
Unshaken: from the rest, when thou went'st forth,
Hope fled: from thee the general spirit flow'd
As light from heav'n. Thy influence reign'd in all;
Thou wert their voice in counsel, strength in war,
In woe, sole prop: thou went'st, and dark despair
Fell on the brave: while strange extravagant tales
That made the Spaniards, gods, found sure belief
In the base fear that forg'd them. Zam.
                                         Lost Peru!
Oh could they hear my voice! e'en now, ere night,
[Page 208]

Spaniards 'gainst Spaniard, arm'd by demons, clash
In unforgiving contest. Knew they this,
Hope would revive, and with reviving hope,
Th'unconquerable will, and pow'r to quell
Th'invader. Oh! how gladly would I pour
My willing blood upon my native earth,
If my blest voice, in death, might warn Peru
Of fate to come! Juan enters. Juan.
                                         Zamorin, thou art free:
Go to yon fort, and as becomes the brave,
Defend thy country. Zam.
                                         Gracious heav'n! I thank thee!
Yet much I fear thou mock'st me. Juan.
                                         Thou art free.
[200]   Yet—hear the terms. Zam.
                                         I knew that thou did'st mock me.
You need not name them. Juan.
                                         Had thy will consented
To young Almagro's death, the western world
Had own'd thy rule. Zama.
                                         He came, a willing victim
Pledg'd for thy life. [Zamorin.] By his kind aid I stand
Here at thy side. Zam.
                     You may depart. Juan.
                                         Yet—hear me:
Nor price of blood, nor aught unjust I claim:
This only, to detain him in yon fort
[Page 209]

A prisoner: Zama, hostage for thy word
Here, in our guard, remains. [after a long pause.] You answer not. Zama.
Yes. He consents. Oh, linger not, Zamorin.
Away, [aside to Zamorin.] and warn Peru of fate to come.
Farewell. Zam.
Oh man! thou hadst not hope to move me. Juan.
I understand thee not. Zam.
                                         Then briefly this,
We love our wives, and in that name comprise
All that earth holds most sacred. Thou art answer'd. Zama.
Good Spaniard! I may move him: pray retire.                                          [Juan goes.
[After a long silence.] You will consent. Zam.
[225]                        Never. Zama.
                                         You love me not. Zam.
Far beyond life. Zama.
                                         More than thy country's freedom,
Than virtue, self-esteem, vows fix'd in heav'n,
That vow, which when Huascar's spirit fled,
Left on his corse a smile? thee I have lov'd
With that pure ardour, which to rightly name it,
Seems likest adoration: for in thee,
Virtue in human shape, gave me on earth
The foretaste of hereafter. I have liv'd
In that persuasion blest: so let me die.
Oh say, you will consent. Zam.
                                         Art thou aware
Of their intent?
[Page 210]
Zama.
                                         I think I shall not live. Zam.
'Tis plain as if Pizarro's voice proclaim'd it:
Thee, they will drag thee underneath the fort,
And in a father's sight— Zama. [interrupting him.]
Oh name it not. Zam.
The fiend will pierce thy bosom, if Villoma
Refuse to yield the fort. Zama, a father
Can ne'er endure that sight. Zama.
                                         Thou wilt be with him:
Control him—and then—sooth him, that he feel not
[250]   That he has lost a child. Zam.
                                         How shall I stand
Unshaken, when a father's heart drops blood? Zama.
Thou art the column that supports Peru. Zam.
It is thy voice, but thou hast chang'd thy nature.
Thy eye, that gazes on me, sheds no tear,
While mine— Zama.
                                         Spare, pity me, consent, farewell. Zam.
Is it a trivial thing to part with life,
That we no more shall meet as once in bliss? Zama.
Husband! clasp, clasp me in thy arms, then ask
That question, and my heart shall answer thee.
Thus, [embracing him.] we will die together. Yet—I fear
Peru's deep curse will load our parting breath. Zam.
Thou more than woman. Zama.
                                         No, a weak, frail woman,
Who has not chang'd her nature: one, from love
[Page 211]

Who borrows strength beyond her pow'r, to utter
What breaks her heart. Say, that we live, Zamorin,
And yield the fort; the earth will groan beneath us;
The sun withdraw his light that we have hymn'd,
Both when it rose and set; for still it blest
Our love, whose bond was virtue. We may shun
A scornful world: how shall we shun ourselves,
The worse despisers? Say, we die together;
[275]   My father to redeem our corse from insult
Would yield the fort, but—as he tomb'd our bones,
Shame would suspend his blessing. Fix our doom:
My soul, high-strain'd beyond its nature, leans
On thee for aid: oh, by thy virtue, husband,
Give strength to mine. Oh let me die in peace,
And make my memory blest.                                          [Rushes out, but returns. Zam.
                                         Farewell—be blest—
Yet—yet. I have a fear.
How shall I speak it? these are bad, bad men.
When he, who should protect, is far away,
When most his aid is wanted— Zama.
                                         Spous'd in heav'n!
Let not a fear for me disturb thee more!
I can protect myself—depart in peace! Zam.
What thy intent? Zama.
                                         Ere the good Spaniard went,
Who brought me hither, I entreated him
One favour for Almagro's sake: he gave it:
Uncertain as I was what doom might wait me,
I begg'd this steel. I will not rashly use it.
[Page 212]

But when all else shall fail, 'twill be no crime
To rescue a pure daughter of the sun,
Thy wife, from touch unblest. Zam. [embraces her.]
We meet—in heav'n.

END OF ACT THE FOURTH.

[Page 213]
ACT V. SCENE I. The Sanctuary of the Temple of the Sun. On each side of the Sun, blazing over his Altar, the embalmed bodies of the Peruvian Emperors, from Manco Capac their first Sovereign, seated on golden thrones. Villoma, Zamorin , Peruvian Chiefs. Vil.
Defenders of your country!
Approach, and on this bloodless altar lay
Your hands, the plighted witness of your vow. Peruv.
We lay our hands— Vil.
                                         Now vow ye will perform
Whate'er Zamorin urges. Peruv.
                                         Hear our vow! Zam. [to Vil.]
Thy duty now is o'er. Oh holy father!
Retire, I pray thee. On their souls I bind
A dreadful charge: their country's freedom claims it:
A charge of blood, whose utterance were unfit
For thy pure ear.                                          [Vil. departs. Zam.
Defenders of Peru!
Who here in awful ecstasy adore
High wonders ne'er expos'd to eyes on earth
Save the Sun's hallow'd race: ye, whom pure zeal,
[Page 214]

And that great cause which consecrates your vow,
The freedom of your country, here unites
In holiest league: by him, who on yon [Manco Capac.] throne,
Now o'er you bends, the founder of our country,
Who from their rocks first drew our sires, and tam'd
To social life, when lone, dispers'd, they wander'd
O'er earth's wide wilderness, where man and beast
Grappled for nature's sov'reignty: by him
[25]   Who first unclos'd the unaccustom'd heart
To pity, tenderness, and gentle joys,
Who to the woods and wilds brute passion chas'd,
And taught the interchange of soul with soul,
And sympathies of kin that make on earth
Each home a blissful heav'n:—By Him, my voice
Adjures you, to resist the fell invader,
Or with your realm, religion, freedom, laws,
In one wide wreck expire— Peruv.
                                         We will resist
Or perish.—Lead us forth— Zam.
                                         No, not to war;
'Tis not to battle that I urge you forth,
To combat with a foe whom hell has arm'd
With its own fires.—They told you they were Gods:
You found them hid beneath their iron mail
Men sensible of pain; and I have found them
Men viler than the beast that roams the wild.
Hear, and rejoice, and hymn the song of praise:
Ere night, their hosts by rival chieftains arm'd
In merciless combat meet. Thou stand, Peru,
Aloof, and when th'exhausted victor mourns
[Page 215]

His conquest, sweep from earth that groans beneath them
The wretched remnant of these Gods distain'd
With kindred murder. Peruv.
[50]                                            On their head our vengeance! Zam.
Be firm; ye must endure a dreadful test:
I cannot speak it. Yet, whate'er ye view,
E'en tho' Villoma in the dust before you
Strew his grey hairs, and pray you spare his age:
E'en tho' the chief whose charge now binds your souls,
Should, slave of human frailty deny
The oath that past his lip, swear ye will guard
The fort till death.—Vow this, or now resign
Your lives, your liberty, your king, your God,
At fell Pizarro's word. Peruv.
                                         Our oath is fix'd. Zam.
Then ye are conquerors—now, friends! farewell—
Each to his separate charge, and guard the gates,
Lest rous'd to frantic agony, Peru
Burst them, and yield the fortress— Peruv.
                                         We have vow'd—                                          [Peruvian chiefs depart. Zam. [falls on the altar.]
Oh thou, who view'st the heart! thou, to whom thought
Speaks without tongue; to thee is no disguise.
Therefore, accept for incense, this deep sigh;
For sacrifice, these tears wrung from the heart
And streaming on thy shrine. These now may fall
Blameless, unseen of man. Yet, not the less
[Page 216]

Sustain me to th'accomplishment, and fill
With dauntless force, that in thy cause my soul
[75]   May triumph: and when free Peru shouts forth
The hymn of praise, rejoin my bride in heav'n!                                          [Exit. Scene changes to Pizarro's Camp. Pizarro, Alvarados , Soldiers. Piz. [to Alv.]
Speed, speed, brave chief! the field may yet be ours.
Lead forth thy charge, and, as the foe ascends
Yon mound, where our brisk cannon shall confound them,
Assail them unawares— Benalcazar enters.
                                         Well, Benalcazar! Ben.
Candia contemns thy offer; he is gone,
With him his valiant pikemen— Piz.
                                         Then, brave chiefs,
We shall have more to conquer. Haste, Alvarez:
Bring Zama hither— Alv.
                                         What now thy intent
I do not look to fathom; but, beware—
'Tis loudly rumour'd thro' th'unquiet camp
That from yon fort releas'd, Almagro's son
Heads his fleet squadrons. All, with eager voice
Count and recount his force, and, as fear reckons,
Swell them at every numb'ring—
[Page 217]
Piz.
                                         Brave Castillians!
The lion counts not when he thins the herd—
On you brave chiefs, Pizarro's glory rests:
Lead forth your separate charges.                                          [Alvarados and Benalcazar go. Zama enters.
                                         Zama, say,
If Cuzco saw beneath her sacred walls
[100]   A daughter of the Sun, and o'er her breast
The quivering dagger gleam, in act to strike,
Would not thy race to rescue her from death
Resign the fort, and hail with grateful shout
The foe who spar'd her life? Zama.
                                         A crime so fell
Would draw down fire from heav'n— Piz.
                                         Thou art the victim,
And I— [Zama kneels.] kneel not to me: beneath yon walls
Urge thy request. Thy race are prone to pity:
A father, and a husband will avert
The threaten'd deed— Zama.
                                         They will not yield the fortress.
A daughter of the Sun now bows before thee,
Who ne'er has bow'd the knee to mortal man.
Grant my request— Piz.
                                         Thy life depends on them— Zama.
Of life I have no hope: I urge no pray'r
That thou, Pizarro, may'st not justly grant.
I shall not live: nor will Zamorin long
[Page 218]

Survive my loss: but it will sooth Villoma,
And seem like shew of solace to his tears
That they are shed upon his daughter's corse.
He is a time-worn man, bow'd by sore grief,
And ere he close my last sad rites, he too
[125]   May rest with me. He is a holy man,
And heav'n till now has smil'd upon his pray'r;
Grant this, and if indulgent Heav'n will hear
The voice of one who for her murderer pleads,
Pangs less severe in death's dread hour shall rack
Thy struggling spirit. A Spanish Chief enters. Chief.
                                         As the gale comes on,
An intermingled noise of neighing steeds,
And troops that shout to battle, mark the advance
Of fierce Almagro's force. Juan enters. Juan.
                                         Haste, Pizarro—
Summon Zamorin: bid him yield the fort,
Or view his Zama perish— Piz.
                                         Speed, brave Juan,
Lead forth my chosen guard, and, if avail
Or skill or courage, yet awhile resist
Almagro's numbers.—Zama, to yon fort.                                          [Exeunt.
[Page 219]
Scene changes to the Fort. Zamorin and Almagro in a watch-tower. Zam.
Look o'er yon rising mound. Again they rally:
Again they charge the foe, and bravely combat
As men who fear not death— Alm.
                                         No more detain me—
You sav'd my life, for you my blood shall flow:
Mine to confront the danger, yours alone
The fruits of victory. Zam.
                                         On either wing
[150]   They hem them round, and bear down all before them.
See, from your numerous squadrons, once again
Their routed lances fly— Alm.
                                         Another troop
Rush from the camp: the men who fled but now
Turn back on their pursuers. Steed on steed
Confus'dly clash, and mix in doubtful fight.
I will not tamely see my warriors slain:
Detain me not: this arm shall turn the battle:
This arm shall rescue Zama. Zam.
                                         No, brave knight,
My word is pledg'd: I trust th'event to Heav'n—
But no false word shall stain Zamorin's lip—
Ah! who yon chief?                                          [a trumpet is heard. Piz. [behind the scenes.]
Zamorin.
[Page 220]
Zam.
                                         Hold, my heart!
'Tis he: 'tis fierce Pizarro, to these walls
Swift he advances. Aid me, Heav'n! Pizarro, Zama , Spanish Chiefs, Soldiers, enter. Piz. [entering.]
                                         Villoma,
Zamorin, yield the fort, or now the Coya
Bleeds in your sight. Peruvians! yield the fort,
Or now the sacred daughter of the Sun
Pollutes with blood your consecrated walls.                                          [Villoma, Zamorin, Almagro, Peruvian Chiefs, People, &c. rush to the lower battlements.] Vil.
My child—my child! Zam.
                                         Sustain me now, oh Sun!
[175]   Remember, chiefs! your vow: keep back the throng! Piz. [standing over Zama with his drawn dagger.]
Consent, or now she dies. Vil.
                                         Hear! Pizarro!
Draw back the steel: the fort, the fort is thine.
Release me from my vow! [to Zamorin.] it is thy wife,
It is thy wife, Zamorin! hear, Peruvians!
Her blood be on your head: the Sun's pure blood!
By these grey hairs! I kneel to you, my children.
Oh spare a wretched father, spare my age.
I have but her.                                          [Villoma faints. Zam.
                                         Convey him from the walls. Chiefs. [to Zamorin.]
Release us from our oaths. People.
                                         Oh horror! horror!
[Page 221]

Come on—force back the bars. Resist us not.                                          [To the Chiefs.
Pizarro! sheath thy blade: we yield the fort. Piz.
Haste, soldiers! fix your standards on yon walls. Zama.
There is no other aid. Zamorin, turn
Thy eyes away. [going to stab herself, is prevented by Pizarro.] Oh feeble arm! Piz.
                                         Peruvians,
Unbar the gates, or now the Coya dies. Voices without.]
Almagro! victory, victory, Almagro! Orgognez rushes in with Almagro's conquering army. Alm.
Pizarro, free the Coya, or thou diest. Piz. [his lifted dagger in act to strike.]
Nay—if thou threaten. Benalcazar and Alvarados , brought in Prisoners and wounded.
                                         Benalcazar, bleeding!
Thou too, [to Alvarados.] disarm'd? Alv.
[200]                                            His forces o'ermatch'd ours. Alm.
Hear, Pizarro!
Release her, or thou diest, and these thy chiefs
Perish in lingering agonies: restore her,
And in exchange receive their ransom'd lives. Piz.
And may I trust to thee?
[Page 222]
Alm. [to Orgognez.]
Brave chief, release them. Alv. [after being released.]
Free her, or Alvarados joins Almagro. Piz. [sheaths his dagger, and frees Zama.]
Pizarro knows thy worth. Alm.
                                         Descend, Zamorin,
Thy firmness has prevail'd. In friendly league,
Beneath Almagro's pow'r, bear rule o'er Cuzco.
But—if the league with Spaniards seem offence,
Almagro shall confirm Pizarro's word.
I will relieve the fort: thou, arm Peru:
The rest is Heav'n's. Now, bid the gates unclose:
Descend, and from a Spaniard's hand receive
Thy peerless bride!                                          [The gates are flung open, Zamorin descends. Zam.
                                         Spaniard! in thee I trust. Zama. [They rush into each other's arms.]
Thou more than mortal! Zama.
                                         My Zamorin! Zam.
Once more, once more on earth we shall be blest.
And thou, [to Almagro.] who hast redeem'd the name of Spaniard
From ever-during guilt, hear the last sound
That from Zamorin's voice shall reach thy ear,
[225]   Till in the van of battle, front to front,
Each leading on his host to death or conquest,
Our shouts immingle. Hear me praise thy virtue,
While I renounce thy friendship. We are foes.
Ye have destroy'd my country, have defac'd
A realm on whose untam'd fertility
[Page 223]

The sun look'd kindly down, and prosperous show'rs
Pour'd forth perpetual harvests: ye have outrag'd
A people, whom content, and peace, and love,
Had bound in purest bliss, that gave to man
In this terrestrial paradise, the pledge
Of heav'n's assur'd beatitude. Oh, stranger!
This race, this realm, this paradise, your steel
And ruthless flame have wasted: I oppos'd:
Nor shall this arm, till death relax its vigour,
Fail to avenge the outrage. Can you say,
“Forgive the offence, be it no more remember'd?”
Go, gather up your host. Hence, as you came:
And when th'unfathomable deep that severs
Our hostile worlds, rolls all its strength between us:
And when our blissful brides, who ne'er have heard
The name of Spaniard, to their bosoms press
A new-born race: and new-born flow'rs and fruits
Hide every spot whereon your foot found rest,
You are forgiven. Till that day, Zamorin
[250]   Feeds in his heart just vengeance. Now—farewell. Back matter

Front matter
TO MISS ANN BOWLES, OF OXFORDSHIRE , WHO, IN TALENTS, GRACES, AND VIRTUES, WOULD HAVE NO RIVALS, IF SHE HAD NO SISTERS, THE COMEDY OF URANIA IS INSCRIBED, BY HER AFFECTIONATE FRIEND,
THE AUTHOR.

[Page iv]

PREFACE. The subject of this Dramatic trifle has been often introduced upon foreign stages, I know not with what degree of merit or success. I once was present at the representation of a German Play, whose principal characters were the prototypes of Manfred and Urania. I have totally forgotten both the style of the dialogue and the conduct of the plot, and much lament that I could never obtain a perusal of any one of those Dramas, which turn, as I have been told, upon similar incidents; as I should probably have better pleased both myself and the public, by substituting imitation for originality. Urania owes much of its success to the attractions of the Music, the exertions of the Performers, and the friendship and advice of a Manager, 1 , who dignifies a liberal profession, by joining to all the perfection of his art every accomplishment of a scholar and a gentleman.

[Page v]
I trust, that an attempt to ridicule the only failings of a great, a learned, and a virtuous nation, cannot be misconstrued; the slight shades of error, which mark the German character, are rendered more conspicuous by the brilliant qualities which surround them. Many defects in a pebble may escape the eye of the lapidary, but a single blemish in a diamond excites his attention and regret. It would be unjust, it would be criminal in me , to libel a nation which has one claim upon my gratitude, superior even to the claims of my native country. I can boast, like the most exalted character in this Kingdom, that I am indebted to Germany for all the blessings of domestic happiness!

PROLOGUE. [By Townshend, J.] WRITTEN BY THE Right Honourable Lord John Townshend .
Though rigid Truth, in narrow bounds, confine
The tame Historian's limited design;
Though hence the cold Philosopher may draw
Sage maxims, founded upon Reason's law;
Not so the Poet checks his bolder fires;
Dull is the Bard whom sober sense inspires!
The unshackled Muse disdains such vulgar rule,
And claims prescriptive right—to play the fool.
Shall then fastidious spleen with critic spite
Presume to censure what it fears to write?
Shall captious wits, to modern Genius foes,
The rich improvements of the Stage oppose?
The public palate, saucily 't is said,
Glutted with offal, is on garbage fed;
And soon, cry these Alarmists of the Stage,
(Who hope the mischiefs that their fears presage,)
Soon, one and all, Box, Gallery, and Pit,
The Stage itself, will loath the name of wit;
Day after day, our Spectre Drama 's cramm'd
With heavenly spirits, or with goblins damn'd,—
Of tame extravagance a cumbrous mass,
That barren brains on patient fashion pass,—
By low Phantasmagoria-Farce debas'd,
The dull Lyceum of degenerate taste!
[Page vii]

With these, a flimsy, flippant tribe combine,—
Authors,—who blush to throw their pearls to swine;
Vain of the triumphs of rejected Plays,
And talents, never mortified by praise;
Who humbly vaunt, who haughtily confess
Their tasteful toils uninjur'd by success,—
Seldom insulted by a three-days run ,
And complimented often with— not one :
Glow-worms of wit, expos'd to light, they fade;
But shine and sparkle in their native shade!
Their boast, their proud distinction, not to please,
Hooted and hiss'd they calmly sit at ease;
While conscious Genius happily supplies
The laurel wreaths a niggard world denies.
We modest Play'rs, by your protection nurst,
Who hope the best, yet always fear the worst,
Prudent we venerate the public voice;
The standard of our judgment is your choice.
Our Piece to-night may brave the critic host;
In truth, Urania is but half a ghost;
Of fairy form , but not of spectre brood ,
A living vision, warm with vital blood!
Critics, ungentle critics, be polite!
O, if not fond, be civil the first night!
Then comes the test!—then comes Urania 's danger!
Then—when the Lady is no more a stranger!

Main text ACT I. Scene SCENE—A Room in the Inn at Tarentum. Enter Pietro , with other Servants bringing in Baggage, followed by Carlos . Pietro. Ay , ay, Signor Carlos, the house will do well enough; every town is not Rome; travellers must not be more nice than wise, and by St. Peter I never knew any travellers who were wise at all; ergo, they ought not to be nice enough to know a down bed from a furze bush:—a plague upon all roving, say I.— “In my pleasant native plains.”
Car. Indeed, Signor, my house has been thought very good by my Lord Fidget, by my Lord Popabout, Sir George Neverstill, and many other noblemen, St. Stephen bless 'em!
[Page 2]
who were great travellers, and, I am sure, both nice and wise notwithstanding; for they were nice enough to object to the eggs being a little addled, and to the sheets being a little soiled; and they were so very wise as never to ask me to deduct from my bill, or to add to my conversation.
Pietro. Ha, ha, ha! wise English travellers! ha, ha, ha! I beg your pardon, Signor Carlos, but I know what a country England is; and that an Englishman who willingly leaves it can ever be wise, is such a ridiculous idea! ha, ha, ha! Well, my dear Landlord, it will all do [25]   very well; I expect my master every moment: —a plague upon all roving, I say. You know, Carlos, that my young Prince of Colonna is coming here to marry your young Princess of Tarentum?
Car. Ay, Heaven bless 'em!
Pietro. Pray, see the best bed-room got ready.
Car. You saw the best bed-room; but—but I am almost afraid to offer his Highness that; because—not that I believe a word of it—the saints protect us! but it has an ugly reputation of being haunted!
Pietro. Haunted! Give me your hand, my dear fellow, you are a made man; my master would give more for an old worm-eaten room full of ghosts, than for a new marble villa full of statues. Haunted! what rare luck for my poor spectre-hunting prince!
Car. Spectre-hunting? that's a very odd sort of sporting. Oh, I've heard something about
[Page 3]
the dogs of darkness, and I suppose your master keeps a pack of them?
Pietro. Why, as to your common night-walking, curtain-drawing ghosts, he does not [50]   now so much attend to them, though he has a sneaking kindness for the whole supernatural family. His views are more elevated at present; he wants to see a what you may call a real vision, a spirit of the true breed; you know what I mean, one of those who have been spirits from father to son, and never had a bit of body belonging to them, a something that no mortal can understand, and is therefore called an immortal intelligence.
Car. Indeed! a most singular taste. I am not quite of his Highness's mind; not that I believe—dear me! what's that?
Enter Jaquelina . Jaq. I came to know if his Honour the servant wanted any thing in my way?
Car. Get along, you idle hussey; you glide in like a—: get along, I say, and get the best bed-room ready, and call Roderigo the gardener, and Giuseppe the ostler, and Gregorio, and as many as you can get to help you; and when they are all there, I'll come and lend a hand too.
                                         [Exit Jacquelina. Pietro. (Calling after her.) Hey! stop, my pretty one; I do want—something just in your way. Egad, she is off like a shooting star.
Car. (Going, returns.) [75]   But, Signor, the boards in the best bed-room are very loose; and—

[Page 4]
Pietro. Oh! his Highness's spectres will rise through them the easier.
Car. (Going.) Jesu help us!—but the bed is so enormously large, and—
Pietro. The more room for his Highness's incubus's.
Car. (Going.) Merciful Heaven!—but then the great dark recess at the end of the room—
Pietro. It will make marvellous good stabling for his Highness's nightmares.
Car. O Lord! O Lord!
                                         [Exit. Pietro. A plague on all roving, say I. Why could not my master stay at Rome, where he had all his ghosts and comforts about him, instead of whirling away so far to look for a young woman?
Enter Jaquelina . Jaq. Did you call, Sir?
Pietro. No; not I. (Looking at her.) Oh, yes, yes, I called! I wanted to—I wanted to ask your name, my dear?
Jaq. Jaquelina, an please you.
Pietro. Please me? to be sure it does please me; and not only your name pleases me, but [100]   your eyes please me, your cheeks please me, your lips please me; (He kisses her, she gives him a box on the ear, and exit) —and the deuce take me if your hands do please me.

[Page 5]
Enter Carlos , showing in Manfred and Conrad . Car. I hope your Highness's Mightiness will condescend to make yourself agreeable here.
Man. All will do very well, my friend. Pray how far is it to the Princess's castle?
Car. Please your Greatness, one part of the castle joins my very house; and the haunted— I mean your Highness's best bed-room—I mean my best bed-room, is, as it were, part of it. My wife (Heaven rest her soul!) was nurse to the Princess; so, when she came to her estate, she gave us this inn, and added a bit of the castle to it as a convenience, and such like.
Man. Most unlucky to be so near! How, Conrad, can I escape this detested business? had we been further from the castle, I might have pretended illness, or found some excuse for not seeing the Princess; but here, every thing will be known: we are already, as it were, in her castle, and surrounded by her nearest dependants.— (To Carlos.) Retire, my friend; and do you, Pietro, go with him to [125]   prepare our apartment.
Pietro. Phew! how my cheek smarts!
                                         [Exeunt Pietro and Carlos. Con. And why, my dear Manfred, should you wish not to see the Princess? Her praises are in every body's mouth; and you know how anxiously your father wishes you to marry her.
Man. And you know, Conrad, how anxiously I wish to avoid it.

[Page 6]
Man. But, surely, after undertaking this journey in obedience to your father, you will give the Princess a fair chance, at least, of converting you. Come, come, Manfred, I know your wild notions of spirits and sorcery are too deeply rooted to give way to the attacks of friendship; but I think that, at your age, Love might conjure up certain visions of his own, strong enough to beat out of the field all the demons of your cabala.
Man. Conrad, my purpose is not to be skaken; I have too long ambition'd the commerce of superior beings to sink into a mere woman's love. Yet I could love—aye, more than love, I could adore; all my being would be passion: my senses even now are on fire!
Con. [150]   The spark has dropped from Nature's torch; cherish the sacred flame, Manfred: placed in the vestal hands of Virtue, it will warm you to the noblest aims, and guide you to the happiest haven of this life.
Man. And can you think, my friend, that after such a zealous and persevering inquiry into the occult science; at the moment when I am almost sure of gaining the affections of an immortal Intelligence, can you think that I will be diverted from my high calling by a mere mortal? I own that my pulses throb at the idea of beauty, and that my heart pines for fellowship; I know, too, that the Princess of Tarentum is fair and virtuous, and mistress of these rich domains; but what are all earthly riches compared to the treasures of the grand science? and what is all human beauty compared to that of the daughters of immortality?

[Page 7]
Con. As I had never any means of making the comparison—
Enter Pietro . Pietro. (To the Prince.) Sir, a man in a long beard and a strange dress desires to speak with you alone in your own apartment.
Man. In a strange dress! Is it an Armenian [175]   dress?
Pietro. Indeed, Sir, I don't know; I am no connoisseur in your African fashions.
Man. Did he know my name?
Pietro. Oh, yes, much better than his own: for when I asked him that, he boggled, and said he had no name; and I am sure if he has one, it can't be a Christian name, for such a heathenish-looking scoundrel I never beheld: I do believe if he got into a church, his very look would turn the frankincense into sulphur, and the holy water into aqua fortis.
Con. Do, Manfred, let him be shown up here.
Pietro. He insists upon seeing my master alone, and in his own room.— (Aside to Conrad.) It is only a ghost-monger come to treat with the Prince about some more dead stock.
Man. Conrad, excuse me. Pietro, show the stranger to my apartment.
                                         [Exit Manfred. Con. What noble qualities are sunk in this infatuating pursuit! But if our scheme succeeds—
Pietro. My master's head is quite turned. Ay, Sir, I knew no good would come of travelling:
[Page 8]
't was all that cursed trip to Germany, [200]   where every body believes in every thing except the Catechism.
Con. Oh, you are too general in your censure, Pietro; you, who have really had a good education, must have known there many men of solid worth and understanding.
Pietro. Well, I have, to be sure; but you must allow that it was impolitic to send a young man, with a mind so exalted, to a country where household ghosts are put into the inventory of household furniture; and where, out of a hundred people, ninety believe in demons, spectres, fairies, witches, vampires, and hobgoblins; in short, in every kind of apparition, from a guardian angel down to a Will o' the Wisp.
Con. Why, in truth, Pietro, you are in the right; Manfred's sanguine mind caught at every bubble of their visionaries;—but now—the Princess of Tarentum—
Pietro. Why, begging his pardon, I think the old Prince his father is but a sorry physician, to recommend a pretty woman as a cure for madness, and matrimony as a receipt against the blue devils.
Con. [225]   Well, honest Pietro, we must hope that either the wings of Love, or the wings of Time, will brush away these specks on a shining character. If your master asks for me, tell him I shall wander over the walks in the neighbourhood, and will meet him at dinner-time.
                                         [Exit. Pietro. Like master like man! What a silly proverb: made, I suppose, by some conceited
[Page 9]
fellow of a master, as mine may be; who, having a superexcellent servant, as I may be, thought, from pure vanity, of this degrading comparison! Can any thing be more different than my master and my master's man? He is a fool, and a woman is to make him wise. I was wise, and a woman is making a fool of me as fast as she can.

I was an ignoramus, and read myself clever;
He was a genius, and read himself mad. I should like to marry a woman, and have a family of little Pietros and Jaquelinas, all squeaking and crying as young Christians ought to do: he would like to marry an apparition, and have a brood of young goblins, see, saw, summing all about the house.
SONG.
My master may boast
[250]   All the charms of a ghost,
And court supernatural merits;
But still to my mind
In a bottle I find
The best and the choicest of spirits.
These spirits possess
Such a magic address,
They can turn a dry crust to a feast, Sir;
They make me cry, they make me sing,
They make me greater than a king,
And sometimes they make me a beast, Sir!
Then let his Highness make a stir
About his fogrum sorcerer,
To all the trade I still prefer
The merry bottle-conjuror!
[Page 10]

Neat spirits from France
Can make the blood dance,
And make the mind buxom and skittish;
But to comfort the heart,
And true valour impart,
The best of all spirits—are British. Scene SCENE—A Room in the Castle. Enter the Princess of Tarentum and Attendant. Princess. Is not Jaquelina returned yet?
Attend. Yes, Madam; she waits your orders.
Princess. Send her in immediately. (Exit Attendant.) Now the moment of trial is arrived; [275]   my hopes and my courage almost fail me. I know Manfred has never seen me; and the old prince, his father, ensures the success of the deception—but—but if I had never seen Manfred, I would never have undertaken such a scheme;—and if, after all, he should resent the deception, when discovered?
Enter Jaquelina . Jaq. Every thing, Madam, is prepared; and the Armenian must, by this time, be in the Prince's apartment.
Princess. Well! but, Jaquelina, do you really think that I shall make a tolerable spirit?
Jaq. Dear Madam, to be sure you will, every body thinks you so like an angel.—Your beauty can accomplish every thing.
SONG.
Nature with swiftness arm'd the horse,
She gave the royal lion force,
[Page 11]

      His destin'd prey to seize on:
To guide the swiftness of the horse,
To tame the royal lion's force,
      She gifted man with reason!
         Poor women! what
         Was then our lot?
   Submission, truth, and duty—
         Our gifts were small;
[300]            To balance all,
   Some god invented Beauty.
For empire Reason made a stand,
But long has Beauty's conqu'ring hand
      In due subjection kept her:
To rule the world let Reason boast,
She only fills a viceroy's post,
      'T is Beauty holds the sceptre! Princess. Oh, you are a flatterer! but will Manfred think so?
Jaq. No doubt of it; the Prince must be a prince of taste. He is so handsome himself; and his looks are somehow so wild and engaging.
Princess. I know too well the perfections of his looks; although I have never seen him but once, at the carnival. But he has never seen me, you know; and if my looks should not please him, when he supposes me a vision, I might cure him of his love for spirits, by means not very satisfactory either to my vanity or my hopes.
Jaq. Depend upon it, Madam, while he takes you for a spirit, he will never think of a woman; but when he finds you out to be a woman, he will send all his spirits packing to [325]   the Red Sea—but indeed it is time.

[Page 12]
Princess. Well, I am ready. Your father Carlos does not suspect any thing! We agreed he was too talkative to be trusted.
Jaq. Oh, no; he is so afraid of the haunted room, that he never goes near it alone; and since our work has been going forward, the noises have confirmed him still more in his fears.
Princess. Go back then, to avoid all suspicion. (Exit Jaquelina.) And now, may the real guardian angels of love empower me to cure the noble Manfred of all enthusiasm;—except that which they inspire!
SONG. (Omitted in the Representation.)

If guardian powers preside above,
Who still extend to virtuous love
   A tutelary care;
The virgin bosom's earliest dole,
The first-born passion of the soul,
   Must find protection there!

Never can noon's maturer ray
That charm of orient light display,
   Which morning suns impart:
So can no later passion prove
That glow which gilds the dawn of Love,
[350]      The day-spring of the heart! Scene SCENE—Manfred's Apartment. Man. (Alone, reading.) Obey the Armenian, it did say—Yes, seven years of unremitted study must ensure me success. Spirits of air and light, fair daughters of immortality, ye, whom
[Page 13]
I have so long adored invisible; in pity to my burning wishes, in recompence for my unwearied toils, deign to bless me with a gracious visitation.—Obey the Armenian, said a voice on the ramparts of Rome! Should this stranger be— (Enter Pietro, showing in a man in an Armenian dress.) Ah! say! speak! are you what your habit proclaims—an Armenian?
Arm. My habit is Armenian—I am a servant to—
Pietro. (Looking at the Armenian.) Ha, ha, ha! you a servant!—that's a queer livery. Long ago every body thought himself good enough to be a statesman, and now-a-days, much more preposterously, every one thinks himself good enough to be a servant. Ha, ha, ha!
Man. (Angrily.) Pietro!
Pietro. You a servant! Ha, ha, ha!
                                         [Exit. Arm. I am a servant to the Higher Powers, whose authority you acknowledge; and for [375]   your long and faithful devotion, I am sent to assist you in your wishes.—Know you this sign?
Man. The mystic triangle!—It must be so— Father, I am yours; command me, dispose of me at your will; only satisfy my longing wishes to be admitted—
Arm. I know your wishes, and if you will cheerfully submit to certain indispensable conditions, they shall be fully accomplished. A spirit of the first order even now is prepared to bless you with the love of an immortal.
Man. Oh! my guide! my benefactor! my gratitude shall be boundless.

[Page 14]
Arm. Stay, Prince; first, I must bind you to conditions, which, I trust, your attachment to the cause will not find difficult.
Man. Oh, speak! my promptest obedience awaits your every command.
Arm. First, then, you know that your father is an enemy to our science, and a scoffer of our mysteries.—Know you not this?
Man. Alas! I do.
Arm. The injured powers must be appeased —Will you swear, on this hallowed triangle, to [400]   renounce your father, to hate your father, and never to see your father more?
Man. Swear to renounce my father! swear to hate my father!
Arm. I say, you must swear to renounce and hate him, and never see him more.
Man. May my tongue wither to its root, if ever it pronounce the impious oath!
Arm. Then must you give up all hopes of supernatural favour.
Man. Old man, thy father must have died before thy birth! Hadst thou ever known a parent, although many long years had seen him in the grave, although age had petrified all thy other affections, thou couldst not have asked a son to hate his father.
Arm. Then renounce at once all spiritual commerce for the affections of an incredulous dotard.
Man. Dotard! But I pardon thee, Armenian; thou dost not know my father: he is a man whom virtue has never once quitted, and whom calumny has never once assailed: in his manners are all the gentle courtesies of life, and in
[Page 15]
his heart all the noblest charities of our nature. [425]   To hate him, whom all others love, would be impious in an alien, in a son impossible.
Arm. But he scorns the science, and the offended spirits command you to renounce him.
Man. Away, impostor! thou beliest their gracious natures.
Arm. Imprudent Prince! thou shalt soon repent thy rashness in accusing me of imposture.
(Stamps his foot—the Scene opening discovers a Female Figure, elevated on a brilliant cloud.) SONG.— Female.

The star-beam of thy natal hour
   Ascendant guides thy way;
A spell beyond the wizard's power
   My charmed steps obey!

If no false light thy search allures,
   The talisman to miss,
This visionary day ensures
   An age of future bliss! Man. Angel! spirit! oh, speak again; do thou command me; do thou prove me: that voice can never counsel ingratitude or impiety.
Arm. The Powers are kinder to thee than thy deserts can claim: beware of disobedience to her; beware, and prosper. (The cloud descends to soft music.)
                                         [Exit. Female. Manfred, your faith and long perseverance have prevailed. I am deputed to reward your labours, if you prove yourself really [450]   worthy of supernatural protection.

[Page 16]
Man. O gracious spirit! one sight of thee has already overpaid all my labours, and all my sacrifices. One single look of thine has already blest me more than all the love of the loveliest of human kind. Oh, tell me by what name I may address thee, and by what means I may preserve thy celestial favour.
Female. I am called Urania. I have long approved your merits, and wished to reward them. But much you have yet to do, to confirm your pretensions to my affection.
Man. My life will be too short to prove the excess and purity of my devotion.
Ura. The colder virtues may require to be proved by length of time; but a single day—a single hour, can give more real proofs of love, than a whole age can furnish. Manfred, the head computes by days and years; the heart's calendar is a calendar of moments, of moments so soft, so bright! they are the down on the wings of Time; and the grains of gold amongst the sand of his hour-glass.
Man. Then shall every moment of my existence be a proof of my devotion.
Ura. [475]   Conrad, your friend, is as yet an enemy to the mystic science; him you must dissuade from his prejudices, and convert to the sect: reveal to him my mission and my nature.—This is all I can communicate at a first interview. Farewell; attempt not to follow me, and remember to obey me. (The cloud reascends to soft music.)
Man. Obey thee, heavenly excellence! my whole soul shall obey thy slightest wishes. Urania! thou art indeed the object which I have so
[Page 17]
long sought for. My heart was not made to feel the influence of mortal beauty; thine, thine alone could realize the dreams of perfection, my fancy so long has followed. Now, Conrad, dispute the truth of our science if thou darest.
                                         [Exit Manfred. Enter Jaquelina . Jaq. Signor Pietro, Signor Pietro!
Enter Pietro . Pietro. Here I am, my dearest; here I am, always at your command.—Those lips have a power in them— (Attempts to kiss her.)
Jaq. You forget the power of my hands, Pietro.
Pietro. No, I don't indeed; they made a lasting impression upon me, I assure you: but it was rather too hard, Jaquelina.
Jaq. [500]   Why, I knew you must be ashamed of your impudence, and I thought a slight tap on the cheek would assist you in blushing.—But here are some of the Princess's servants, come to invite you to the Castle.
Enter Servants, &c.
[Page 18]
FINALE. SONG.— Jaquelina.

If , Sir, you fear, from travelling here,
   To feel fatigue or dryness,
You'll find, be sure, a speedy cure
   In the cellars of her Highness.

When strangers roam so far from home,
   We study to content them,
And give them all, in the Castle-hall,
   A welcome to Tarentum. Pietro.
To hosts like you, so frank and true,
   We trav'lers show no shyness;
Away we'll all to the Castle-hall,
   And drink a health to her Highness. Chorus of the Princess's Servants.
Away we'll all to the Castle-hall,
   And drink a health to her Highness.

END OF THE FIRST ACT.

[Page 19]
ACT II. Scene SCENE—The Garden of the Castle. Enter Roderigo , the Gardener. Roderigo. Oh Jaquelina! that you, whom I thought the sweetest and the purest of flowers, should turn out such a venomous weed!—you first sowed the seeds of love in the hot-bed of my heart, brought them forward with the sunshine of your eyes—and now comes the frost of your unkindness, to nip all my hopes!—My eyes run over like a watering-pot, and my heart swells like a bulged cabbage—Then to leave me, who sprung on her own native soil, for this exotic Pietro—a canker on him!—if I could see him, I would root him out like a dock.
                                         [Works. Enter Pietro , reading a Letter. Pietro. Oh! bless thy mal-spelling, kind-hearted, lovely Jaquelina—the Princess has promised thee five hundred sequins if thou marriest a worthy man—I am a worthy man, and thou wilt marry me: ergo, the five hundred sequins are thine; and ergo, they are mine. O sweet-looking pot-hooks, up and down—up and down, like the jacks of an harpsichord playing
[Page 20]
a jig. Then for my rival—what does the dear creature say, (reading) “I like a single word of yours better than all Roderigo's famous [25]   speeches.”
Rod. (Looking up.) Roderigo's famous peaches? Did your Honour wish for some of my famous peaches? Indeed, I believe there are no finer in all Italy, they all grow on a south wall; and as I suppose your Honour is the young Prince who is come after our Princess, I shall be proud to offer you of the very best.
Pietro. (Aside.) Egad! this is my rival himself; he has never seen me, and my fine air makes him take me for the Prince—this will do. Hem! indeed, are you Roderigo? the most renowned gardener that ever put dung to a cucumber? I am happy to make your acquaintance. I was just reading one of my letters from Rome, wherein my friend desires me to taste Roderigo's famous peaches.
Rod. Your Honour's greatness is very flattering, to be sure—to be sure, I believe no gardener ever produced a finer show of fruit, or flowers either; then, to be sure, I have studied in botany, and know how to call every plant by its long name. But now, your Honour, I must give it all up—I must give it all up—and [50]   all, begging your pardon, owing to your Honour.
Pietro. Give up your profession, owing to me? how so, Signor Roderigo?
Rod. Is not your Honour the master of one Pietro?

[Page 21]
Pietro. Why—why yes, in some degree, his master; Pietro generally does every thing that I wish him to do.
Rod. Now then, if your Honour would only wish him to hang himself, perhaps he might obey you, and all would be well with me again.
Pietro. Why, faith, I never thought of forming such a wish for Pietro. There was once, indeed, some idea of Pietro's being hanged; and it gave me such a confounded odd feel about the neck, that I have never liked to think of it since.
Rod. Oh! I see your Honour's heart is as tender as a medlar , and therefore I may venture to mention Jaquelina.
Pietro. Jaquelina! Oh, dear—I like that name; pray mention it as often as ever you please.
Rod. Well then, your Honour, this Jaquelina [75]   is daughter to Signor Carlos, who lives here, hard by.
Pietro. Ay, I know him.
Rod. Why then, this Jaquelina, please your Honour, used to come here into the Princess's garden, and after moistening her mouth with some of my peaches, that your Honour has heard so much about—(I will get your Honour some of them by dinner-time)—I used to teach her the long names of the plants, and tell her a little about grafting and propagation, and such like; and then we talked about plants loving each other, and—
Pietro. Oh, I understand you; talking about the fashionable system of vegetable matrimony.
[Page 22]
Plants that cling together, hot-beds, nurseries, suckers, and so forth, put you in mind of—
Rod. Just so, your Honour, put me in mind of classing her and myself according to the Linnean system.
Pietro. Faith, Roderigo, nothing could be more natural. I dare say you have found all the ladies more frequent visitors to your garden since this system has become prevalent.
Rod. In truth, all the ladies who come to [100]   the castle do say that botany has lately become a most interesting pursuit.
Pietro. To be sure it has; in my country there is scarcely a girl of twelve years old, who cannot tell you every vegetable intrigue, from a rose-tree down to a cabbage-plant: the sphere of love, and of scandal too, is removed from the play-house to the kitchen-garden.
Rod. True, very true, your Honour—If you could but see here sometimes the Countess Hortensia, with her two pretty daughters, Signora Rosa, and Signora Myrtilla, how they do handle and finger every flower that they meet with! Dear Mamma, says one, do see this plant, it looks rather withered and drooping; do you think it is in love, Mamma? Lord, child, says she, that's a tetrandrian plant, which has got four husbands, you know—poor thing, no wonder it looks drooping, (she adds, with a sigh;) four husbands must be a great deal to bear with!!
Pietro. In truth, Signor Roderigo, botanical loves are interesting, or disgusting, according to the nature of the parties—an amorous myrtle
[Page 23]
may give a pleasant idea, but a gallant parsnip [125]   —oh, fie!—Linnean amours may be pleasing among geraniums, in a green-house, but they are d---n'd low amongst sow-thistles in a ditch. But Jaquelina—
Rod. Well then, it was all going on with her as smooth as a nectarine, and I was calling her my sweet Jonquilina (Jonquilina, your Honour, instead of Jaquelina), when comes your Honour's Pietro, and grafts a new passion on her heart, which made mine wither away in a moment.
Pietro. Well, but then, I fear, Roderigo, that your graft did not suit the stock as well as his.
Rod. May be, but I think mine might have made her bear fruit as soon as his —but be that as it may, he has destroyed all the blossoms of my happiness, and I am only in doubt which I shall root out of the land of the living; him, or myself!
Pietro. Oh, of the two, yourself, by all means. Killing your rival would be acting like a common nurseryman—to kill yourself for love, would prove you the first of horticultural heroes, and ensure you an episode in the next [150]   edition of the Loves of the Plants.
Rod. Egad! I believe your Honour's in the right—but—but the punishment for killing one's self, I have heard say, is heavier than for killing another man; and if I should be detected in an attempt at suicide , I think they call it, I might be transported.
Pietro. Transported! to be sure you would, and your fortune would be made, Why, you
[Page 24]
would be transported to Egypt, where, you know, all the vegetables are divinities; and I have no doubt, with your ability, you would soon rise to be high priest to the God Artichoke.
Carlos. (Within.) Signor Pietro, Signor Pietro!
Pietro. What can Carlos want with my Pietro? I must see what sets him a-bawling so. Adieu, Roderigo; think of the high priesthood.
Rod. That I will, and blessings on your Honour; I will go to father Anselm directly, and confess that I am going to kill myself, and perhaps he may set spies upon me to prevent me: and the hopes of such a transportation make me almost wish to be interrupted in my attempt.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene SCENE— Manfred 's Apartment. Urania sleeping on a Couch. Enter Manfred and Conrad , not seeing her. Man. Indeed, indeed, Conrad, your prejudices are most unjust, now that I have convinced [175]   you of the reality of the vision; you will believe it the work of evil spirits. I own, the Armenian did propose a cruel and an unnatural condition; but he is only a servant to the powers of the air, the minister of their orders, not the interpreter of their sentiments.
Con. I cannot believe that good will come from such equivocal sources.

[Page 25]
Man. Equivocal! Oh, would Urania deign to be visible to you, how every look would convince you of her angelic nature!
Con. Manfred, the witchery of mere human beauty has often changed honour and gentleness into meanness and cruelty; what, then, should you not fear from supernatural charms?
Man. (Seeing Urania.) Heavens! she is here —she sleeps, calm as the day-spring of Paradise. Conrad, are these the slumbers of an evil spirit?
Con. They may be the dissemblings of an evil spirit—deception is the demon's surest arm. I own, the seeming innocence of her sleeping looks against my unshaken conviction, bewitches and enthralls me. Fly, fly, my friend, ere it be too late—old as I am, I dare not trust myself with her allurements.
                                         [Going. Man. [200]   Stay, Conrad, I beseech you—stay— her voice, her sentiments, will, and must, persuade you.
Con. No, Prince, I will not witness your weakness, or endanger my own resolution; the Princess of Tarentum awaits me at the castle, where I must put some colour on your ungracious conduct.
                                         [Exit. Enter the Armenian . Arm. So far, Prince Manfred, your trial is successful. You have well withstood the persuasions of your suspicious friend. He is, I suppose, of those philosophers who mistake incredulity for penetration; and who, when forced into conviction, ascribe every effect to its worst possible cause. I leave you to your
[Page 26]
further proofs—remember your promise of submission to Urania—upon yourself alone must depend your failure or success.
                                         [Exit. Ura. (Rising.) This corporeal covering which I have assumed for your sake, subjects me to some frailties of mortality. My ethereal essence sinks under its pressure—I slept the sleep of a mortal, but my dreams were the dreams of a spirit—they were prophetic, Manfred, and foreboded danger and ill to thee.
Man. [225]   Did they forebode the loss of Urania? Did they foretell a change in her, from kindness to aversion?
Ura. Ah! no—you may lose Urania from your own failings; but even when lost to you, she will ever regret and remember Manfred.
Man. Best, kindest, loveliest of angel natures, tell me how I may repay thy goodness, and preserve thy affection—try me by time, by dangers, by every sacrifice.
Ura. Manfred—thy father—
Man. Ah!
Ura. See, what a change one single word can operate. Where are now thy boasted love, thy sanguine promises of sacrifice? Were I but a mortal woman, and had shown thee proofs of attachment like mine, ought I not to be preferred to a father? Nature itself has ordained the supremacy of love over all other affections. Manfred, were I subject to mortality, and thou couldst save from destruction one only—either thy father, or Urania—tell me, on thine honour, which thou wouldest preserve?
Man. Oh! I would save my father, and die with thee!

[Page 27]
Ura. [250]   Manfred, there is an overawing sanctity in thy filial affection, which even spirits must admire, and of which even love dare not be jealous. I ask thee not to renounce thy father —thou hast a trial of another kind—go instantly to Conrad, who seeks thee with tidings from thy home.—Farewell. Once more, presume not to follow me—soon, very soon, mayst thou prove thyself completely worthy of Urania!
                                         [Exeunt severally. Scene SCENE—A Room in the Inn. Enter Pietro at one door, and Carlos at the other; Carlos seeming very much frightened. Car. St. Peter, St. Stephen, St. Anne, St. George, St. Patrick, protect me!
Pietro. What's the matter, Signor Carlos? you seem to labour under some slight degree of apprehension.
Car. Oh dear, oh dear! it must have been she!
Pietro. What must have been she , and who is she ?
Car. My poor wife, to be sure.—Heaven rest her soul—what can have disturbed her?—I am sure I always wished her to be quiet in her grave.
Pietro. When she was alive, Carlos, that wish must have been rather ungallant; and now she is dead it must be rather unnecessary.
Car. [275]   Signor Pietro, as I was coming down the dark passage which leads from the haunted
[Page 28]
chamber towards the back gate of the castle, a white figure whisked by me, and vanished into the wall.
Pietro. Well! but did you touch it?
Car. Bless you, touch it? Why, I tell you, it was my poor dear wife—I would sooner have touched the devil.
Pietro. Did you see her face then?
Car. No, not a feature—but I am sure it was she—I knew how it would be. When she was alive, she was always gadding about, because, she said, her own house was dull; and now she is dead, I dare say she pretends that her own grave is lonesome.
Pietro. But, my dear Carlos, how can you be sure it was your wife? Did it speak to you?
Car. No, faith, it did not speak at all; and that is very unlike my wife—oh, but I forgot, she died of the lock-jaw, and that accounts for it.
Pietro. Indeed, Carlos, a wife coming back from the grave is a very rational cause for alarm —but, as you say, you saw it coming from towards [300]   the Prince's chamber; I dare say it was only one of his familiars.
Car. Why, it might be so, to be sure; I never thought of that—and I do suppose that wherever his Highness puts up, he always finds his own ghosts. If he was to ring up my poor dead wife to serve him, I would make the article of waiting the heaviest charge in his bill.
Pietro. Oh, never fear that, Carlos, he is always provided; he has circular letters to all the charnel-houses in Europe: and can draw
[Page 29]
upon every churchyard in the world, for as many spectres as he pleases.
Car. A most extraordinary credit indeed— Well! but you really think it was one of his Highness's?
Pietro. Most undoubtedly—I told you that his Highness rather wants it here (pointing to his head) , and I verily believe, that he would rather marry a ghost, with only a winding-sheet to her portion, than the Princess of Tarentum with a kingdom for her dowry.
Car. As for that matter, Signor Pietro, perhaps the Prince would rather marry a ghost than a woman, because he would have little [325]   chance of a rival, and does not want it here (pointing to his head.)
Pietro. Ha, ha, ha! very good indeed—I see I have convinced you that your wife is safe in her tomb; or you would not be in such a good humour—and now that you are in such a good humour, I must tell you, that I prefer a certain piece of true flesh and blood, called Jaquelina, to all the Goblinas, Spectrinas, and Skeletinas of his Highness's spiritual seraglio.
Car. What, our Jaquelina? I am sure, Signor Pietro, you are very kind; but there is one Roderigo—
Pietro. Pshaw—Roderigo; never mind him.
Enter Jaquelina . Jaq. Oh, dear father, never mind Roderigo.
Pietro. Pooh, pooh, don't mind Roderigo.

[Page 30]
Jaq. Lord, who minds Roderigo?
Pietro. What man minds Roderigo?
Car. Have done with your Roderigo's; I shall never bear his name again, after such a dinning in my ears.
Pietro. So much the better—the fact is, Carlos, Jaquelina's eyes are as clear-sighted as they are sparkling, and they have made their election in my favour; and Roderigo (I beg your [350]   pardon for mentioning his name) is so convinced of it, that, after debating whether he should kill himself or me, he has taken father Anselm's advice, not to kill either, but to look out for a less clear-sighted sweetheart.
Car. Well then, I don't know, if Jaquelina consents, and the Princess consents, and Roderigo consents—
Pietro. You will consent too—thank you, dear Carlos—come, Jaquelina.
Car. But, you are quite, quite sure, that it was one of the Prince's spirits—if it should have been my wife, she will certainly come again, to forbid your banns—she would prefer a gardener to all the world, for a son-in-law, from her great love to garlick and onions.
Pietro. Oh! I will ensure you and ourselves from her interference. Do, good Carlos, prepare us a good supper, and we will go to the castle for the Princess's permission, and then to church, and then to supper, and then to—
Jaq. Come along, do. But, Pietro, you know Time and Cupid both have wings, and I am afraid that they will fly away together.

[Page 31]
Pietro. Oh, no! Time may move as fast as he [375]   chooses—Love shall never fly faster than a silk-worm.
Jaq. But I am afraid Cupid will not be of much use to us, when time has been long on the wing.
Pietro. O, yes, he will—we'll keep the little god to teach our children blind-man's buff.
DUET. Pietro and Jaquelina .

Time 's hand, which wrinkles ev'ry face,
No furrow on the heart can trace,
   While Love sustains its pow'rs;
For those who shun domestic strife,
His scythe shall mow the weeds of life,
   And only prune its flow'rs.

If our thoughts never roam
From the pleasures of home,
   Ev'ry day shall increase our delight;
And Cupid shall stay,
Till his pinions, grown grey,
   No longer can serve him for flight! Scene SCENE—A Wood near the Castle. Enter Manfred and Conrad with Letters. Con. Well, Manfred, by these letters you now know the melancholy secret—your father did not press you to this marriage with the Princess, from the sordid wish to add opulence to opulence—he did it to save your illustrious house from irretrievable poverty.

[Page 32]
Man. Oh yes, I understand his motive, and [400]   deeply feel his kindness—this lawsuit has deprived him of all his disposable property—he has, indeed, enough from a pension for his own life; but to me he can only leave an empty title.
Con. And does not such a father's kindness deserve every attention to his wishes?
Man. Oh! I would show prompter obedience to my father's slightest wish, than to a despot's mandate—but he only wishes my happiness, which this hated marriage must for ever annihilate.
Con. He does only wish your happiness; but he wishes to found it on reason and reality, not on fancy and illusion.
Man. Conrad, the illusions of fancy, which only reach the head , are often brilliant and misleading meteors; but those which play round the heart are gleams of the joy of other worlds; the dawn and promise of heavenly bliss, which some favoured mortals are allowed thus imperfectly to foretaste!
Con. Remember, with what considerate gentleness your father reminds you of your destitute situation—do not decide precipitately, Manfred —remember, that the promises of beings, at [425]   best but of a doubtful nature, must be equivocal, and may be dangerous.
                                         [Exit. Enter Urania . Ura. Did not my dreams too truly prophesy? I know the subject of that fatal letter. I know, that in giving up the Princess of Tarentum, you
[Page 33]
must give up all hopes of the splendour which becomes your name—you must resign opulence, honours, and titles.
Man. And if I do resign them, what do I resign? that which with happiness is a superfluous ornament, and without happiness a galling trapping.
Ura. Be not deceived by false hopes, Manfred. Remember that spirits of my order can bless thee with science, with the secrets of nature, and with love; but worldly riches they cannot command. Try thy heart well; canst thou renounce all earthly grandeurs for Urania?
Man. Oh, yes, without a pang, without a thought; thou canst not, and I will not want them.—Here, then, at thy feet, spirit, angel, goddess, whatever thou art, here do I bind myself to thee for ever, in spite of poverty and misfortune.
Ura. Manfred, I cannot doubt thy truth.— [450]   What men are these advancing through the grove?—Unusual horrors harrow up my nature —see, Manfred—oh, they wear a sign upon their vestment which spirits ever fly from.—Farewell, farewell; my protection cannot now avail thee.
                                         [Exit. Enter Inquisitors. Inq. Prince Manfred of Colonna, I arrest you in the name of the holy Inquisition.
Man. In the name of the Inquisition! What charge have ye against me?
Inq. You are charged with sorcery, and with holding commerce with supernatural agents;
[Page 34]
you have even been seen with an evil spirit in your chamber.
Man. 'T is false, ruffian; it was a spirit from the heaven of heavens!
Inq. Brothers, he owns the charge; prepare your irons.
Man. And who is my accuser?
Inq. A man in an Armenian habit.
Man. The Armenian accuse me!
Inq. You must instantly appear with us before the Princess of Tarentum.
Man. Before the Princess! oh, lead me to any tribunal except hers.
Inq. She must be your judge in the first instance. [475]   We pray you, Sir, not to delay; the Princess awaits us in council.
Man. To come before the Princess, not as a lover, but as a culprit!—My father disobeyed —Urania fled! This is indeed too hard a trial.
                                         [Exeunt. Scene SCENE—A magnificent Hall—The Princess on her Throne, veiled in the Italian Fashion, Ladies, Counsellors, Attendants, &c. &c.— Conrad standing near her. Enter Manfred with Inquisitors. Princess. Holy ministers of justice, is this the man for whom my warrant was obtained?
Inq. It is, dread Lady, the Prince of Colonna.
Princess. (To Conrad.) This too, Sir, is your friend, the despiser of Tarentum's Princess. (Descends from her throne.) Prince of Colonna,
[Page 35]
the heavy charge of sorcery is against you; an accomplice has accused you; do you deny the charge?
Man. I do not deny that, which in appearance may condemn me. If to have been blest with the presence of the fairest of the children of light be sorcery, I am indeed guilty, and would not have lost such guilt to have saved myself from the rack.
Princess. Prince, I have heard of your infatuation; I pity your weakness, and have power to mitigate your sentence. You are accused by an Armenian, himself of doubtful character: [500]   will you repel your own accusation, by accusing him?
Man. No! if he is a traitor, I am none. I alone am guilty.—I will not accuse the Armenian.
Princess. Will you then swear to give up for ever all intercourse with the spiritual object of your passion?
Man. Give up Urania! No. I have already most cheerfully resigned for her both honours and affluence, and will now meet death and tortures rather than renounce her. No power on earth should make me give up Urania, even if she were only a mortal woman.
Princess. Would you not give up Urania, even if she were only a mortal woman, and even if that mortal woman were the Princess of Tarentum? (Raising her veil.)
Man. Merciful Heavens! Urania!
(The Armenian advancing from behind the Attendant, takes off his mask.) And will you not now accuse the Armenian?

[Page 36]
Man. My father!
Princess. Yes, Manfred, Urania is the Princess of Tarentum, and I became a spirit to try your virtue, and now become a woman again [525]   to reward your attachment.
Arm. And I, who as an Armenian witnessed your filial piety, now reward it with a father's tenderest blessing.
Man. My senses are bewildered with surprise and gratitude. I see and understand the whole of your kind plot. You have medicined most delightfully to my distempered mind; and shame for my past follies is the only alloy to this my present happiness.
Arm. I always knew your heart was virtuous, though I lamented your devotion to a dangerous and deceitful science. In my last journey to Sicily, I saw this lovely Princess, who consented to try your merits by the scheme we have pursued, and thanks be to Heaven that it has so amply succeeded!
Princess. Yes, Manfred, I did consent; but I must own that one sight of you at the Carnival, one conversation you held there with a certain tormenting mask, did more towards persuading me than all your father's eloquence.
Enter Pietro, Jaquelina , and Carlos . Pietro. (To Princess.) Please your Highness, we come to—Hey day! the Prince and Princess hand in hand—talking of marrying themselves, [550]   I know by the trim of 'em. Well, then, may it please both your Highnesses to let me and
[Page 37]
Jaquelina do just what both your Highnesses are going to do?
Princess. Jaquelina has certainly my consent, and with it double the portion I promised her. —You owe her something too, Manfred; for without her assistance and secrecy we could never have managed our plans in her father's house.
Man. To you, Jaquelina, I give a thousand thanks, and to you, Pietro, a thousand—
Pietro. A thousand what, your Highness?
Man. A thousand sequins.
Con. And now, Manfred, my fondest wishes are accomplished: I trust I have always guarded your heart from the corruptions of vice; but the delusions of your imagination could only be cured by this most lovely reality.
Man. Yes, my delusions are cured, but my belief has only changed its object. In thee, adored Urania, let me still find my attendant, my protecting genius; and may every man, who witnesses my present conversion, like me, find out at last, that a lovely and virtuous [575]   wife is his best and surest guardian angel.
FINALE. Jaquelina.
Pleasure from illusion free,
Your happy lot shall ever be;
For love, with more than magic skill,
Your brightest visions shall fulfil.
[Page 38]
Chorus.
Love, enchanter of the heart!
Triumph to thy mystic dart!
May never amulet repel,
Or time uncharm so sweet a spell! Roderigo.
May his Highness ever be
A faithful Monogynian tree!
May suckers soon her Highness grace,
And prove the flowers of their race ! Chorus.
Love, enchanter of the heart, &c. Urania.
Long with the charm of mild command,
May you enchant this grateful land:
The world that magic pow'r must praise,
Which can a nation's spirits raise ! Full Chorus.
Love, enchanter of the heart!
Triumph to thy mystic dart!
May never amulet repel,
Or time uncharm so sweet a spell! Back matter

FINIS.
