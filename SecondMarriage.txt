ACT I. 

SCENE I. 

A garden: the Gardener discovered at work amongst some shrubs and flowers. Enter Robert hastily, calling to him as he enters. 


Robert. 
Stop , stop, Gardener! What are you about there? My mistress's rose trees rooted out of her favourite nook thus! Get out of this spot with your cursed wheel-barrow! If there were one spark of a christian in your heart, you would pluck the last hair off your bare scalp rather than root out these shrubs. 


Gar. 
Softly and civily, Master Robert; and answer me one question first.---If I intend to remain gardener in this family, and make my pot boil and my family thrive as I have done, whether will it be wiser in me, do you think, to obey your orders or my master's? 


[Page 364 ] 



Rob. 
And did he order you to do this? 


Gar. 
As sure as I hold this spade in my hand. 


Rob. 
I should as soon have thought of tearing the turf from my mother's grave as of doing this thing. Well, well; perhaps he has forgot that she liked them. 


Gar. 
Now I rather think he remember'd, when he gave me the orders, that another lady likes them not; and a dead woman's fancy match'd against a living woman's freak, with a middle-aged widower, hear ye me, who has just pull'd the black coat off [25]  his back, has but a sorry chance, Robert. 


Rob. 
Ay, and he has pull'd the black coat too soon off his back. But away with it!---I'll think no more of what you say---it is impossible. 


Gar. 
May I never handle a spade again, if she did not squint to this direct spot, with her horrid looking grey eyes, the last time she walked thro' the garden, saying it was a mass of confusion that ought to be cleared away, and he gave me the orders for doing it the very next morning. 


Rob. 
Who could have believed this? Who could have believed this but a few months ago, when she rambled thro' these walks, with all her white-frock'd train gamboling round her? 


Gar. 
Nay, good Robert, don't be so down o'the mouth about it: the loss of his wife and an unlook'd-for legacy of twenty thousand pounds, may set a man's brains a working upon new plans. There is nothing very wonderful in that, man. He will get his lady-wife and the borough 

[Page 365 ] 

together, with a power of high relations, you know, and we shall all be fine folks by and bye.--- Thou wilt become master-butler or gentleman-valet, or something of that kind, and I shall be head gardener, to be sure, with a man or two to [50]  obey my orders: we sha'nt be the same pains-taking folks that we have been, I warrant you, when he is a parliament man. 


Rob. 
Thou'rt always looking after something for thine own advantage, and that puts all those foolish notions into thy noddle. No, no; he has lived too sweetly in his own quiet home, amongst the rustling of his own trees and the prattling of his own infants, to go now into the midst of all that shuffling and changing and making of speeches. He'll never become a parliament man. 


Gar. 
Well then, let him marry Lady Sarah for love if he please, I'll neither make nor meddle in the matter. If she keep a good house, and give good victuals and drink to the people in it, I'll never trouble my head about it. 


Rob. 
Out upon thee, man, with thy victuals and thy drink! Thou'rt worser than a hog. Well should I like, if it were not for the sake of better folks than thee, to see thy greedy chaps exercised upon her feeding. 


Gar. 
What, is she niggardly then, and so fine a lady too? 


Rob. 
Niggardly! she will pull off her wide hoop, and all them there flounces that people go to court [75]  in, to search over the house for the value of a candle's 

[Page 366 ] 

end, rather than any of the poor devils belonging to her should wrong her of a doit's-worth. Thou'lt have rare feeding truly when she comes amongst us. 


Gar. 
Heaven forbid it then! No wonder thou'rt anxious she should not come here. I always wonder'd what made thee so concern'd about it. 


Rob. 
And dost thou think, swine that thou art, I am concern'd for it upon this account? Thou deservest to be fed on husks and garbage all thy life for having such a thought. I, who was the friend, I may say the relation of my good mistress (for thou knowest I am her foster brother) and when I look upon her poor children playing about, I feel as tho' they were my own flesh and blood. It is not that I boast of the connection: God knows I am as humble as any body! 


Gar. 
Ay, no doubt; and a rare good thing it is, this same humility. I know a poor ass, grazing on the common, not far off, that to my certain knowledge is foster brother to a very great lord, and yet, I must say that for him, I never saw him prick up his ears or even shake his tail one bit the more for it in my life. By my certics! he must be a very [100]  meek and sober minded ass! 

                                         (singing and gathering up his tools, &c.) 
Take this in your hand for me, man; I'm going to another part of the garden. 

                                         (holding out something for Robert to carry.) 



Rob. (pushing away his hand angrily.) 
Take care of it yourself, fool: you would sing tho' your father were upon the gallows. 


[Page 367 ] 



Gar. 
I crave your worship's pardon! I should have whined a little, to be sure, to have been better company to you. 
(looking off the stage.) 
But here comes a good man who frowns upon nobody; the worthy rector of Easterdown: I'll go and bid him welcome; for he likes to see a poor fellow hold up his head before him, and speak to him like a man. 


Rob. 
You bid him welcome, indeed! stand out of the way: I'll bid him welcome myself. He is as good as my own---No matter what. He is married to my good mistress's sister; ay, and his own father christen'd me too. I'm glad he is come. You go to him indeed! 
Enter Mr. Beaumont . 

O Sir! you're welcome to this sad place. 


Bea. 
I thank you, honest Robert; how do you do? 


Rob. 
So, so; I'm obliged to you for the favour of asking. Woe is me, Sir! but this be a sad place [125]  since you came last among us. 


Bea. 
A sad change, indeed, my good friend, and you seem to have felt it too. You look thin and alter'd, Robert. 


Rob. 
I ha'n't been very merry of late, and that makes a body look--- 

                                         (passing his hand across his eyes.) 



Bea. (shaking his head.) 
Ay, what must thy poor master be then, since it is even so with thee? Poor man, it grieved me to think that I could not be with him on the first shock of his distress, but illness 

[Page 368 ] 

and business of importance made it impossible for me to leave Yorkshire. How does he do? I hope you look cheerfully before him, and do all that you can to comfort him. 


Rob. 
Indeed I should have been very glad, in my homely way, to have done what I could to comfort him; but, I don't know how it is, he gets on main well without, Sir. 



Bea. (surprised.) 
Does he?---I'm very glad to hear it. I love him for that, now: it is a noble exertion in him; he has great merit in it, truly. 


Rob. 
Humph, humph. 

                                         (a pause.) 


Bea. 
What were you going to say, my good Robert? 


Rob. 
Nothing, Sir; I was only clearing my throat. 


Bea. 
[150]  How does he sleep, Robert? 


Rob. 
I can't say, Sir, not being present when he's a-bed, you know. 


Bea. 
How does he eat, then? little rest and little food must, I fear, have brought him very low. 


Rob. 
Nay, as for the matter of his eating, I can't say but I find as good a notch made in the leg of mutton, when he dines alone, as there used to be. 


Bea. 
Well, that's good. But I fear he is too much alone. 


Rob. 
No, Sir; he has dined out a pretty deal of late. He does, indeed, walk up and down the shady walk by the orchard, and talk to himself often enough. 


[Page 369 ] 




Bea. (alarmed.) 
Does he? that is a sign of the deepest sorrow: I must speak to him; I must put books into his hands. 


Rob. 
O Sir, there's no need of that; he has a book in his hand often enough. 


Bea. 
And what kind of books does he read? 


Rob. 
Nay, it is always the same one. 


Bea. 
Well, he can't do better: there is but one book in the world that can't be too often in a man's hand. 


Rob. 
Very true, Sir, but it is not that one, tho'.--- [175]  I thought as you do myself, and so I slyly look'd over his shoulder one morning to be sure of it; but I saw nothing in it but all about the great people at court, and the great offices they hold. 


Bea. 
You astonish me, Robert. His heavy loss I fear has bewildered his wits. Poor man! poor man! and all the sweet children too! 


Rob. 
Yes Sir, they---they will feel--- 


Bea. 
What would you say, my friend. 


Rob. 
Nothing, Sir. This vile neckcloth takes me so tight round the throat, an' a plague to it! 



Gar. (coming forward with a broad grin.) 
God bless you, Sir! I be glad to see you here. How does your good lady and master William do? He is grown a fine young gentleman now, I warrant, he, he, he, he, he! 



Rob. (to Gar. angrily.) 
Can't you ask a gentleman how he does, fool, without putting that damned grin upon your face? 


[Page 370 ] 



Bea. 
Why, my friend Robert, what words are these you make use of? 


Rob. 
True Sir, I should not have used them; but when a body is vexed he will be angry, and when a body is angry, good sooth! he will e'en bolt out with the first word that comes to him [200]  though he were a saint. 


Bea. 
Too true, Robert; but long before a body becomes a saint, he is very seldom vexed, and still seldomer angry at any thing. 


Rob. 
God bless you, Sir! I know very well I a'n't so good as I should be, and I wish from my heart I was better. 


Bea. 
Give me your hand, honest Robert; you will soon be better if you wish to be so, and it is a very pleasant progress when once it is fairly begun. 
(Looking off the stage.) 
I think I see your master at a distance. Good day to you! good day to you, Gardener! 

                                         (Exeunt severally. 

SCENE II. 

A parlour with a door opening into the garden. Seabright and Beaumont are seen walking together in the garden. Bea. talking to Sea. as they enter. 




Bea. (continuing to talk.) 
I must indeed confess, my dear friend, you had every thing that this world can bestow; a moderate fortune, with health to enjoy it; the decent, modest tranquillity, of private life, and the blessings of domestic harmony; I must, indeed, confess you were a happy man. 

[Page 371 ] 


(pauses and looks at Sea. who says nothing.) 
Your measure of good things was compleat; it was impossible to add to it; there was no more for you to desire on this side of heaven. 

                                         (pauses again.) 



Sea. (answering very tardily.) 
I had, indeed, many of the comforts of life. 


Bea. 
Many of the comforts of life! you had every thing the heart of man can desire; and, pardon me, you could afford to lose part of your felicity, dear as that part might be, and still retain enough to make life worth the cherishing. To watch over your rising family; to mark the hopeful progress of their minds; to foster every good disposition and discourage every bad one found there: this, my friend, is a noble, an invigorating task, most worthy of a man. 


Sea. 
It is certainly the duty of every man to attend to the education of his children: their fortunes [25]  in the world depend upon it. 



Bea. (looking displeased at him.) 
Poo! their fortunes in that world from which this will appear but like a nest of worms, a hole for grubs and chrysalis's, that world which is our high and native home, depend upon it. 
(walking up and down disturbed, and then returning to Sea. with a self-upbraiding look.) 
Forgive me, Seabright! you know I am sometimes thus, but my spark is soon extinguished. I am glad---I ought to be glad to see you so composed. It is a noble conquest you have gain'd over your feelings, and what must it not have cost you! Give me your hand, and be not thus constrained with me: I know the weakness of 

[Page 372 ] 

human nature, and dearly do I sympathize with you. 


Sea. 
You are very kind, my friend; but you have travelled far; you must want refreshment; let me order something. 

                                         (going to the door and calling a Servant , to whom he gives orders.) 



Bea. (aside.) 
Well, there is something here I don't understand. But I am wrong, perhaps: Some people can't bear to have the subject of their sorrow touched upon: I'll talk to him of other things.--- 
(Aloud to Sea. as he returns from the door.) 
Your old acquaintance, Asby of Gloucestershire, called upon me a day or two before I left home, and enquired kindly after you. He is a very rich [50]  man now; he has purchased the great estate of Carriswood, near his native place, and is high sheriff of the country. 



Sea. (becoming suddenly animated.) 
What, Asby? my old school-fellow Asby? that is a great rise, by my soul! The estate of Carriswood, and high sheriff of the county! What interest has pushed him? what connexions has he made? has he speculated with his money? how has he advanced himself? 


Bea. 
I can't very well tell you: he has gone on, like many others, turning, and scraping and begging, and managing great people's matters for them, till he has become one of the most considerable men in that part of the country. 


Sea. 
He must be a clever fellow. We used to think him stupid at school, but we have been dev'lishly deceived. 


[Page 373 ] 



Bea. 
No, you have not, for he is stupid still. His brother, the poor curate of Crofton, is a clever man. 



Sea. (contemptuously.) 
The poor curate of Crofton! One of those clever men, I suppose, who sit with their shoes down o' the heel, by their own study fire, brooding o'er their own hoard of ideas, without [75]  ever being able from their parts or their learning to produce one atom's worth of good to themselves or their families. I have known many such: but let me see a man, who from narrow and unfavorable beginnings, shapes out his own way in this changing world to wealth and distinction, and, by my faith! he will be wise enough for me. 


Bea. 
My friend, you become animated: I am happy to see you so much interested in the fortune of others; it is a blessed disposition. I have something also to tell you of your old friend Malton, which I am sure will give you pleasure. 


Sea. 
What, he has got a fortune too, I suppose, and is standing for the country. 


Bea. 
No; something better than that, my friend. 


Sea. 
Ha! Well, some people get on amazingly! 


Bea. 
It is amazing, indeed, for it was altogether, hopeless. You remember his only son, the poor little boy that was so lame and so sickly? 


Sea. 
Yes, I do. 


Bea. 
Well, from some application, which I cannot remember at present, the sinews of his leg have recovered their proper tone again, and he is growing up as healthy a comely looking lad as you can see. 


[Page 374 ] 



Sea. 
O, that is what you meant---I am glad to [100]  hear it, certainly; a cripple in a family is not easily provided for. But pray now, let me understand this matter more perfectly. 


Bea. 
I tell you I have forgot how they treated the leg, but--- 



Sea. (impatiently.) 
No, no, no! What relations, what connexions had Asby to push him? a man can't get on without some assistance:---his family, I always understood, was low and distress'd. 


Bea. 
He had two or three ways of getting on, which I would not advise any friend of mine to follow him in, and the worst of them all was making what is called a convenient marriage. 



Sea. (affecting to laugh.) 
Ha, ha, ha! you are severe, Beaumont: many a respectable man has suffered interest to determine even his choice of a wife. Riches and honours must have their price paid for them. 


Bea. 
Trash and dirt! I would not have a disagreeable vixen to tyrannise over my family for the honours of a peerage. 


Sea. 
Well, well! people think differently upon most subjects. 


Bea. 
They do indeed; and it is not every one who thinks so delicately, and has so much reason to do [125]  so, upon this subject, as we have, my dear Seabright. Our wives--- 



Sea. (interrupting him hastily.) 
And he comes in for the county, you say? 


[Page 375 ] 



Bea. 
No, no, Seabright! you mistake me: high sheriff of the county, I said. How you do interest yourself in the fortunes of this man! 


Sea. 
And what should surprise you in this? By heaven there is nothing so interesting to me as to trace the course of a prosperous man through this varied world! First he is seen like a little stream, wearing its shallow bed through the grass; circling, and winding, and gleaning up its treasures from every twinkling rill as it passes: farther on the brown sand fences its margin, the dark rushes thicken on its side: farther on still, the broad flags shake their green ranks, the willows bend their wide boughs o'er its course: and yonder, at last, the fair river appears, spreading his bright waves to the light! 



Bea. (staring strangely on him, then turning away some paces, and shaking his head ruefully) 
Poor man! poor man! his intellects are deranged: he is not in his senses. 

Enter a Servant . 




Sea. (to Ser. ) 
Very well. 
(to Bea. ) 
Let us go to the breakfast room, Beaumont, and you'll find [150]  something prepared for you. 

                                         (As they are about to go out, the children appear at a distance in the garden.) 



Bea. (looking out.) 
Ha! yonder are the children! Blessings on them! I must run and speak to them first. 

                                         (Exit into the garden to the children. 



Sea. (to himself, looking contemptuously after Bea. ) 
Ay, go to the children! thou art only fit company for them! To come here with his comfort and his 

[Page 376 ] 

condolence full eight months and a-half after her death ---he is a mere simpleton! His wonderful delicacy too about interested marriages---he is worse than a simpleton! And my only business now, forsooth! must be to stay at home and become schoolmaster to my own children!---he is an absolute fool! 
(turning round and seeing the servant still standing at the door.) 
Have you enquired at the village which of the inns my Lord Lubberford stops at on his way to town? 


Ser. 
Yes, Sir; but they don't know. 


Sea. 
But they must know! Go and make farther enquiries, for I must pay my respects to his Lordship as he passes. Were the fruit and the flowers carried to Lady Sarah this morning? 


Ser. 
I don't know, Sir. 


Sea. 
Run to the gardener, and put him in mind of it. 

                                         (Exeunt. 

SCENE III. 

A library. Enter Seabright , who walks several times slowly across the stage as if deeply engaged in his own mind, then stops short with a considerable pause. 



Sea. 
I am now upon the threshold of distinction, and with one step more I cross it. On this side lies spiritless obscurity; on that, invigorating honour. 
(pauses.) 
Member of Parliament! there is magic in the words, and of most powerful operation.---Let that man find a place elsewhere; why should I squeeze myself and every body round me to make 

[Page 377 ] 

room for him? Sir, he's a Member of Parliament. ---Let that fool hold his tongue there; why do we silently listen to all his prosing stuff? Sir, he's a Member of Parliament.---What; bells ringing, children huzzaing, corporation men sweating at this rate, to welcome that poor looking creature to your town? To be sure; he's a Member of Parliament. ---Ay, so it is! I too have mixed with the ignoble crowd to stare upon men thus honoured. I have only now to over-step the bounds, and be myself the very thing I gazed at. 
(pausing again.) 
---There is indeed a toll, a price of entrance that must be paid, and my heart stands back from it; but there is no other way than this, and what I would wear I must purchase. O it is well worth its price! To be but known and named as filling such a place in society brings pleasure with it. And in the eyes of [25]  our early friends too---Methinks I can see at this moment every curious face in my native village gathering about the letter-boy, as he sets out upon his rounds, to look with grinning admiration upon my first franks. "Free, Seabright;" ha, ha, ha! 

                                         (laughing to himself and rubbing his hands together with great complacency.) 
Enter Robert . 




Sea. (turning round shortly like one who is caught.) 
What brings you here, sirrah? 


Rob. 
You desired me to tell you, Sir, when Miss Seabright returned from her walk. 



Sea. (with his countenance changed.) 
And is she so soon returned? 


[Page 378 ] 



Rob. 
Yes Sir, and I have told her you wish to speak with her. 


Sea. 
You have told her---I wish---I looked not for her so soon---I wish you had not--- 


Rob. 
Sir! 


Sea. 
Begone! begone! and say I am waiting for her. 
(Exit Rob. stealing a look of observation at his master as he goes out.) 
---Ah! here comes the hard pull! here comes the sticking place! I should have prepared her for this before, but my heart would not suffer me. O that I had employed some one else to tell her! She little thinks of this! I hear her coming 
(listening; while children's voices are heard without.) 
What, she is bringing the children with her! I hear the little one prating as he [50]  goes. O God! I cannot---I cannot! 

                                         (Exit running out with much agitation. 

                                         (Enter Sophia , carrying a little boy on her back, and an elder boy and girl taking hold of her gown.) 



Soph. (to the little one .) 
You have had a fine ride and a long ride, have you not? 


Little One. 
Yesh, tit. 


Soph. 
Come down then, boy, for your horse is tired. 


Little One. 
No, tit. 


Soph. 
No, tit! but you must tho' 
(setting him down.) 
Stand upon your fat legs there, and tell me what I'm to have for all this trouble of carrying you. What am I to have, urchin? 


Little One. 
Kish. 


[Page 379 ] 




Soph. (after kissing him affectionately.) 
And what am I to have for these comfits I have saved for you? 


Little One. 
Kish. 



Soph. (kissing him again.) 
And what am I to have for the little dog I bought for you this morning? 


Little One. 
Kish. 


Soph. 
What, kish again? Kish for every thing? 
(kissing him very tenderly.) 
O you little rogue! you might buy the whole world for such money as this, if every body loved you as I do. Now children, papa is not ready to see us yet, I find, so in the mean time, I'll divide the little cake I promised [75]  you. 

                                         (taking a little cake from her work-bag and dividing it; whilst Robert , peeping in at the door and seeing Seabright not there, ventures in, and stands for a little while looking tenderly upon Soph. and the children. 


Rob. 
God bless all your sweet faces! 


Soph. 
What do you want here, good Robert? 


Rov. 
Nothing---nothing.---God bless you all, my pretty ones! 
(listening.) 
I hear him coming. 

                                         (Exit, looking piteously upon them, as he goes off.) 


Soph. 
I hear papa coming. 


Little Girl. 
I'll run and meet him. 


Eldest Boy. 
Don't Emma! he does not like to play with us now; it is troublesome to him. 


Little Girl. 
When mama was alive he play'd with us. 


Soph. 
Hush! my good girl. 

[Page 380 ] 

Enter Seabright . 

We have been waiting for you, papa; Robert told us you wanted to see us all together. 


Sea. 
Did Robert tell you so? I wanted to see you alone, Sophia, but since it is so, the others may remain. I have got something to say to you. 


Soph. 
You look very grave, my dear Sir: have I offended you? 


Eldest Boy. 
It was I who broke the china vase, so don't be angry with her for that. 


Sea. 
My brave boy! it is distress, and not anger, that makes me grave. 


Soph. 
And are you distress'd, papa? O don't be distress'd! we will do every thing that we can [100]  to please you. I know very well we can't make you so happy as when mama was alive; but we will be such good children! we will obey you, and serve you, and love you so much, if you will but play with us, and look upon us again as you used to do! 



Sea. (softened.) 
My dear girl, I wish I could make you all happy: I wish to raise your situation in the world above the pitch of my present confined abilities: I wish--- 
(stops and is much embarrassed.) 



Soph. (kissing his hand.) 
My dear, dear father! you say that I am your dear girl, and I promise you you shall find me a good one. I want no better fortune in the world, than to live with you and be useful to you. I can overlook the household matters, and order every thing in the family as you would like to have it. I want no better fortune 

[Page 381 ] 

than this: I shall be a happy girl and a proud girl too, if you will put confidence in me. 



Sea. (taking her hand tenderly.) 
My sweet child! this would be a dull and sombre life for a young girl like you: you ought now to be dressed and fashioned like other young people, and have the advantage of being introduced to the world by those who--- 


Soph. 
[125]  O no! I don't care whether my gown be made of silk or of linen: and as for being dull, never trouble your head about that; we shall find a way to get the better of it. Do you know, papa,--- but I am almost ashamed to tell it you.--- 


Sea. 
What is it, my dear. 


Soph. 
I have been learning to play at backgammon: for you know mama and you used to play at it of a winter evening; and I'll play with you, if you will allow me. 


Sea. 
O God! O God! this is too much! 

                                         (turns from them in great agitation, and running to the opposite side of the room, stands leaning his back against the wall, whilst Sophia and the children gather round him.) 


Soph. 
My dear father! what is the matter? 


Eldest Boy. 
Are you not well, papa? 


Sea. 
I am well enough! I am well enough! but I have something to tell you, and I cannot tell it. 


Soph. 
For God's sake let me know what it is! 


Sea. 
You must know it: it is necessary that you should. I am--- 

                                         (pauses.) 


Soph. 
A bankrupt. 


[Page 382 ] 



Sea. 
No, no, no! I am going to be married.--- 
( Sophia staggers some paces back, and stands like one perfectly stupified.) 
What is the matter, Sophia? are you going to faint? 


Soph. 
No, I sha'n't faint. 


Sea. 
Be not so overcome with it, my dear child! [150]  it is for the good of my children I marry. 
(pauses and looks at her, but she is silent.) 
You, and all children in your situation, look upon these matters with a prejudiced eye. It is my great regard for you that determines me to take this step. 
(pauses, but she is silent.) 
Do you hear me? Will you not speak to me? 


Soph. 
O my poor mother! little did I think when I kiss'd your cold hands, that you would so soon be forgotten! 


Sea. 
No more of this, my dear! no more of this! It is improper; it is painful to me. I have not forgotten ---I love---I respect---I adore her memory: but I am engaged---it is necessary---your interest, is concerned in it, my dear children; and I know, my good Sophia, you will not add to your father's distress by stubborn and undutiful behaviour. 


Soph. 
O no, my dear Sir! if you love and adore her memory I am satisfied. Yet, if you do, how can you---O how can you!---I will say no more: God bless you and give you a good wife! 
(weeping.) 
But she will never be so good as my mother: she will never love you as my mother did. 


Sea. 
Forbear, my good girl! I know it very well; and I don't marry now to be beloved. But Lady [175]  Sarah is a very good woman, and will make me as 

[Page 383 ] 

happy as I can expect to be: she is sister to Lord Allcrest, you know, and is related to the first people of the country. 


Soph. 
Good heaven, Sir! you can't mean to marry Lady Sarah: all the world knows how ill-temper'd she is. 


Eldest Boy. 
What, that lady with the cunning-looking nose, and the strange staring eye-brows? If she come into this house I'll cast my top at her. 


Soph. 
Hold your tongue; George! papa is not so hard hearted as to set such a woman over us. Come, come, children! gather round and hold up your little hands to him: he will have pity upon you. 
(the children gather round, and Sophia , putting the hands of the youngest child together and holding them up, kneels down before him.) 
O Sir! have pity on them! We have nobody to plead for us, and I cannot speak. 

                                         (Enter Robert with his face all blubbered, and throwing himself upon his knees by the children, holds up his hands most piteously.) 


Rob. 
O, Sir! 



Sea. (bursting into a violent rage.) 
What, sirrah! have you been listening at the door? Go from my presence this moment! 


Soph. 
Dear Sir! be not angry with him! 



Sea. (putting her away.) 
No, no! let us have no more of this nonsense: I have listen'd too long to it [200]  already. 

                                         (breaks from them and exit.) 


Rob. 
I wish my head had been cut off before I had come in with my ill-timed assistance! Curse 

[Page 384 ] 

upon my stupid pate! I deserve to be hang'd for it. 
(beating his head and grasping his hair.) 
O my pretty ones! I sent you all to him that you might work on his heart, for I knew what he wanted to say well enough, and yet I must needs thrust in my silly snout amongst you to mar all! For a man that can read books and cast accounts, and all that, to do such a trick! I deserve to be cudgel'd! 


Soph. 
Don't be so angry at yourself, Robert: you meant it well, and you have always been so good to us! 


Rob. 
Good to you! I love you like my own flesh and blood, every one of you; and if any body dare to do you wrong, I'll---no matter what. 
(clenching his fist and nodding significantly.) 
He may turn me off if he please; but I'll not quit the neighbourhood: I'll watch over you, my pretty ones; and hang me if any one shall hurt a hair of your heads! 


Soph. 
I thank you, Robert: but don't tell any body: that would not be right, you know. Come, children; you shall go with me to my own room. 

                                         (Exeunt Sophia and children by one side, and exit Robert by the other, looking after them with tenderness and pity.) 
END OF THE FIRST ACT.


[Page 385 ] 


ACT II. 

SCENE I. 

Before the front of Seabright 's house. 

Enter Plausible and Prowler . 



Plau. 
Do you wait for me in that farther walk yonder, till I come from visiting my subject. 


Pro. 
Well, God grant he prove a good subject! we are woundily in want of one at present. 


Plau. 
Don't lose courage, man; there is always a certain quantity of good and of bad luck put into every man's lot, and the more of the one that has past over his head, the more he may expect of the other. Seabright has a fortune to speculate with, and some turn, as I have been told, for speculation: he is just launching into a new course of life, and I have a strong presentiment that I shall succeed with him. 


Pro. 
Now away with your presentiments! for we have never yet had any good luck that has not come pop upon our heads like a snow-ball, from the very opposite point to our expectation: but he has got an unexpected legacy lately; and I have observed that a sum coming in this way, to a man of a certain disposition, very often plays the part of a decoy-bird to draw away from him all the rest of his money: there I rest my hopes. 


[Page 386 ] 



Plau. 
Why you talk as if I were going to ruin him, instead of encreasing his fortune by my advice. 


Pro. 
[25]  I have seen ruin follow every man that has been favour'd with your advice, as constantly as the hind legs follow the fore legs of a horse, and therefore I cannot help thinking there must be some connexion between them. However, I don't pretend to reason, Plausible: it might only be some part of their bad luck that happen'd just at those times to be passing over their heads; and they have always, in the mean time, supplied you and your humble follower with money for our immediate wants. 


Plau. 
Well, hold your tongue, do! 
(knocks at the door, which is opened by Robert .) 
Is your master at home? 


Rob. 
Yes. 


Plau. 
Can he be spoken with? 


Rob. 
No, Sir, he can't see you at present. 


Plau. 
At what hour can I see him? 


Rob. 
I don't know, Sir. 


Plau. 
Is he so much engaged? But you seem sad, my friend: has any thing happened? You had a funeral in the house some months ago? 


Rob. 
Yes, Sir; but it is a wedding we have got in it at this bout. 


Plau. 
I had the honour of calling on Mr. Seabright [50]  yesterday morning, but he was not at home. 


[Page 387 ] 



Rob. 
Yes, Sir; he has been at the borough of Crockdale to be chair'd, and the parish of Upperton to be married; and he returned last night--- 


Pro. 
Bridegroom and Member of Parliament! 


Rob. 
Keep your jokes till they are ask'd for. 


Pro. 
They would be stale jokes indeed, then. 



Plau. (to Pro. ) 
Hold your tongue, pray. 
(to Rob. ) 
He is engaged? 


Rob. 
Yes, Sir; he is with the bride and the company, in the garden, at breakfast. 


Plau. 
Well, I shan't disturb him at present.--- Here is a crown for you: you will recollect my face again when you see it? I'll call again very soon. 



Pro. (aside.) 
Mercy upon us! the last crown we have in the world given away on such a chance! It shan't go tho'. 


Rob. 
O yes, Sir, I'll recollect you. 

                                         (Exit Plausible .) 



Pro. (lingering behind.) 
Don't shut the door yet. Hark you, my good Mr. John, for I know your name very well! 


Rob. 
My name is Robert. 


Pro. 
Yes, Robert I said. 


Rob. 
Did you so, truly! have not I ears in my [75]  head? 


Pro. 
Assuredly Sir, and ears, let me tell you, that will hear good news soon, if you will be counsell'd by me. 


Rob. 
Anan? 


Pro. 
Have you never a mind to put out a little money to advantage? a guinea or so, now, in such 

[Page 388 ] 

a way as to return to you again with fifteen or twenty of his yellow-coated brethren at his back? 


Rob. 
Poo with your nonsense! I have sent two or three guineas out upon such fools errands already. 


Pro. 
And did they come back empty handed to you? 


Rob. 
No, by my faith! for they never came back at all. 


Pro. 
O lud, lud! there be such cheats in this world, they frighten honest folks from trying their fortune. I have got a crown of my own, just now, and with another crown put to it by any good hearted fellow that would go halves with me in the profit, I have an opportunity of making a good round sum, at present, in a very honest way, that would almost make a man of me at once: but I'm sure I don't advise you to do it; for prudence is a great virtue; prudence is a very great virtue. 

                                         (Bell rings, and Robert stands hesitating.) 


Rob. 
[100]  Hang it! a crown is no great matter after all. There it is 
(giving him the crown whilst the bell rings again.) 
How that plaguy bell rings! When you get the money for me, you'll know where to call? 


Pro. 
Never fear! when I get the money for you, I'll find my way back again, I warrant you. 

                                         (Exeunt. 


[Page 389 ] 


SCENE II. 

A garden, with a temple seen at some distance, in which are discovered Lady Sarah, Sophia , Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont , and William Beaumont , as if seated after breakfast; whilst Gardener and one or two of the Servants skulk near the front of the stage, behind some bushes, looking at them. 



Gar. 
Bride indeed! she's as unlovely a looking piece of goods as ever I look'd upon. See how she stares at every thing about her, and curls up her nose like a girkin! I'll warrant you she'll be all thro' my kitchen grounds by-and-by, to count over my cabbages. 


First Ser. 
Hold your tonge, man: we're too long here: see, they are all breaking up now, and some of them will be here in a trice. 

                                         (Exeunt Servants . 

                                         (The company come out from the temple, and Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont advance to the front of the stage, talking together earnestly.) 



Bea. (continuing to talk.) 
Nay, my dear, you are prejudiced and severe; it did not strike me that she behaved to you with so much forbidding coldness. She has an ungracious countenance to be sure, but now and then when it relaxes, she looks as if she had some good in her. 


Mrs. B. 
Yes, Charles, you find always some good in every one of God's creatures. 


Bea. 
And there is some good in every one of God's creatures, if you would but look for it. 


[Page 390 ] 



Mrs. B. 
I'm sure those who can find it out in her have a quicker discernment than I can pretend to. How unlucky it was that we came to the house last night, without enquiring before hand the state of the family! I thought I should have fainted [25]  when they told me of the marriage; and when I saw that creature in my sweet sister's place! 


Bea. 
I pitied you, my dear Susan, very much, indeed I did; but it would have look'd pettish and unforgiving in us to have gone away again at that late hour; and I think we must stay with them till to-morrow. For the children's sake we must endeavour to be on good terms with them. But here come William and Sophia. 

                                         (Enter William Beaumont and Sophia , talking as they enter.) 


Wil. 
You like the yellow-streak'd carnations best? 


Soph. 
Yes, I think they are the prettiest, tho' we have but very few of them. 


Wil. 
O then I'll make our gardener sow a whole bushel of carnation-seed when I get home, that we may have a good chance, at least, of raising some of the kind you admire. And what else can I do for you, Sophy? Shall I copy some of my friend's verses for you? or send you some landscapes for your drawing-book? or---did not you say you should like to have a rocking-horse for little Tony? 


Soph. 
Indeed you are very good, cousin. 


[Page 391 ] 



Wil. 
No, no! don't say that: there is no goodness at all in doing any thing for you. 



Soph. (going up to Mrs. B. who puts her arm affectionately round her.) 
My dear aunt! 


Wil. 
[50]  Ah, mother! see how tall she has grown since we saw her last, and how dark her hair is now. 



Mrs. B. (archly.) 
You like fair hair best, I believe, William. 


Wil. 
I like fair hair! I can't endure it! 



Mrs. B. (smiling.) 
Well, well, you need not be so vehement in expressing your dislike. 


Bea. 
Here comes Lady Sarah to join us: this at least is civil, you will confess. 



Lady S. (coming forward to join them.) 
You are fond, Ma'am, I perceive, of the shade, from prefering this side of the garden. 
(formally to Mrs. B. who coldly bows assent.) 
It is a very pleasant morn-for travelling, Mr. Beaumont. 


Bea. 
Yes, Madam, it is a very pleasant morning for travelling. 


Lady S. 
I'm sorry, however, that you will have so much dust on your road to town. 



Soph. (to Mrs. B. ) 
Why you don't go to day, aunt? I thought you were to stay longer. 


Mrs. B. 
No, my dear, we go this morning. 

                                         (looking significantly to Beaumont .) 


Lady S. 
Would not the cool of the evening be more agreeable? 


Mrs. B. 
No, Ma'am, the coolness of this morning has been quite enough to induce us to set out [75]  immediately. 


[Page 392 ] 

Enter Servant . 




Ser. (to Lady S. ) 
Some poor people from the village are come to wish your Ladyship health and happiness. 



Lady S. (ungraciously.) 
I am obliged to them.--- What do they mean? Ay, ay! tell them I am obliged to them. You need not wait; that is all. 

                                         (Exit Ser. whilst Mrs. B. smiles significantly to her husband.) 


Soph. 
I wonder if my old friend, Huskins, be amongst them: I'll run and see. 

                                         (going to run out.) 


Lady S. 
Perhaps, Miss Seabright, will do me the honour to consult me upon what friendships are proper for her to cultivate. 



Mrs. B. (seeing Sophia distressed.) 
If your Ladyship will permit us, she shall retire with me for a little. 

                                         (Exeunt Mrs. B. and Sophia. 



Wil. (aside to his father, as they are about to follow them.) 
What an ugly witch it is! must we leave Sophia with her? 

                                         (Exeunt Beaumont and William B. Lady Sarah looking after them suspiciously.) 
Enter Seabright . 




Lady S. (turning to him with affected sprightliness.) 
So you have been upon the watch, I suppose, and will not suffer me to stroll thro' these shady walks alone: I am positively to have no time to myself. 


Sea. 
You don't call me an intruder, I hope? 


Lady S. 
Indeed if you become very troublesome, I don't know what I may call you. He, he, he! 
(laughing foolishly. Seabright putting his hand up to 

[Page 393 ] 

the side of her hat, she pushes it away with pretended coyness.) 
How can you be so childish! he, he, he! 



Sea. (gravely.) 
[100]  Won't you let me pick a caterpillar from your ribband? 



Lady S. (looking foolish and disappointed.) 
O! is that it? I am much obliged to you: but you are always so good, so tenderly attentive to me! Indeed this little hand was well bestow'd upon you, Seabright: I wish it had convey'd to you a better gift when it gave away myself. 

                                         (thrusting out a great brown hand to him.) 



Sea. (raising it to his lips with affected tenderness.) 
What could it possibly convey, my dear Lady Sarah, more--- 
(stopping short as he is about to kiss it.) 
It that a family ring upon your finger? 


Lady S. 
Yes, it was my mother's: why so? 


Sea. 
The arms of the Highcastles' are upon it: Lord Highcastle then is your relation? 


Lady S. 
I am nearly related to him. 



Sea. (with his countenance brightening.) 
I did not know this: by my soul I am glad of it! He is in credit with the minister: you are on good terms with him, I hope. 


Lady S. 
Yes, I have always taken pains to be upon terms with him. 


Sea. 
I dare say you have; I dare say you have: you have so much prudence, and so many good qualities, my dear love! 

                                         (kissing her hand with great alacrity.) 


Lady S. 
O it is all your blind partiality! 
(putting her hand tenderly upon his shoulder.) 
[125]  Do you know, 

[Page 394 ] 

my dear Mr. Seabright, that coat becomes you very much: I wish you would always wear that colour. 


Sea. 
I'll wear any thing you like, my dear. But, by-the-bye, my constituents at Crockdale, have a manufacture of woollen in the town: I must buy two or three hundred yards of their stuff from them, I believe, lest I should have occasion to be elected again. 



Lady S. (taking her hand eagerly off his shoulder.) 
Two or three hundred yards of stuff from them! Why the cheapest kind they make is eightpence-halfpenny a yard: only consider what that will come to. 


Sea. 
No very great sum! 


Lady S. 
I am surprised to hear you say so! Now I should think if you were to send the mayor and aldermen a haunch of venison now and then when it comes in your way, and the earliest information of any great public events that may occur, it would be a more delicate and pleasing attention. 


Sea. 
Well, well, my dear Lady Sarah, don't let us fall out about it. 


Lady S. 
I am perfectly good humoured, I assure you; but you are so--- 


Sea. 
[150]  Yonder is your maid coming to speak to you, I'll leave you. 


Lady S. 
Indeed she has nothing to say: I won't suffer her to break in upon our tender conversation. 


[Page 395 ] 



Sea. 
But I must go to give directions about accommodating Lord Allcrest and his friend. They will be here soon. 


Lady S. 
Nay, there you have no occasion to give yourself any trouble: leave every thing of that kind to me: you are too profuse, and too careless, in every thing. 


Sea. 
I may at least go to the stables and give my groom orders to provide oats for their horses. 


Lady S. 
I have a very good receipt in my receipt book for feeding horses upon the refuse of a garden. 



Sea. (shaking his head, and breaking away from her.) 
No, no! that won't do. 

                                         (Exit. 
Enter Pry with a busy face. 



Lady S. 
What brings you here, Pry? Did not you see Mr. Seabright with me? 


Pry. 
I protest, my Lady, I have been looking at so many things this morning, I can't tell what is before my eyes. 


Lady S. 
You have look'd over every thing then as I desired you: and I hope you have done it as if it were to satisfy your own curiosity. 


Pry. 
[175]  To be sure, my Lady; and I might say so with truth too, for nothing does my heart so much good as looking thro' all them there places. And O dear, my Lady! the chests, and the wardrobes, and the larders, and the store-rooms, that I have look'd into! but that cunning fellow, Robert, would not let me into the wine-cellar tho'. 


[Page 396 ] 



Lady S. 
And you are sure you let them understand it was all to please your own curiosity. 


Pry. 
To be sure; and I was glad I could speak the truth too, for I never does tell a lie but when I cannot get a turn served without it. I remember, my Lady, you told me long ago that this was the best rule; and I have always held you up, my Lady, for an ensample. Lord have mercy upon their souls that will tell you over a pack of lies for no other purpose but to make people laugh! And there is all your writers of books too, full of stories from one end to the other, what will become of them, poor sinners? 


Lady S. 
Never trouble your head about them: what have you seen? 


Pry. 
O dear me! the sheets and the table-linen, and the pickles, and the sweetmeats, and the hams, and the bacon that I have seen? 


Lady S. 
[200]  Indeed, Pry! 


Pry. 
But do you know, my Lady, there is a curious place in the house. 


Lady S. 
What is it, pray? 


Pry. 
A closet where they keep cordials for poor people. 



Lady S. (sourly.) 
Humph. 


Pry. 
It was kept for that purpose by the late Mrs. Seabright, and this young lady, I am told, is as fond of it as her mother was. 


Lady S. 
Humph---every body has some maggot or other. 


[Page 397 ] 



Pry. 
Certainly, my Lady, but this is a very strange one tho'. For you must know, my Lady, I thought no harm just to taste one of the bottles myself, thinking it might be some pennyroyal-water or blackberry-wine, or such things as charitable ladies give away; but I protest it is as good liquor as any gentlewoman would chuse to keep for her own use. 


Lady S. 
I believe it has run in your head, Pry? 


Pry. 
No, no, my Lady; whatever I may do by myself when I have a pain in my stomach, or such like, for nobody can help afflictions when it pleases heaven to send them, I never takes more than is creditable [225]  before people.---And, O my Lady! the pans of milk, and the butter, that I have seen in the dairy! And I assure you, my Lady, the servants make good use of it: they make spare of nothing: the very kitchen maids have cream to their tea. 


Lady S. 
Well, well; we shall see how long this rioting will last. 


Pry. 
And I have been in the garden and the orchard too---But stop! I hear a noise in the bushes. 



Lady S. (looking round alarmed.) 
Why did you talk so loud, you gossiping fool? Come with me into the house. 

                                         (Exeunt Lady Sarah and Pry , looking round alarmed.) 


[Page 398 ] 


                                         Enter Gardener , creeping from amongst the bushes, and shaking his fist and making faces after them. 


Gar. 
I have been in the garden and the orchard too! hang'd jade! we shall see who comes off winner at last. 

                                         (Exit. 

SCENE III. 

Enter Seabright followed by Robert . 




Sea. (speaking as he enters.) 
And he'll call again, you say? his name is Plausible. 


Rob. 
Yes, Sir; he is a very grave sensible looking man. 


Sea. 
And has nobody else call'd? 


Rob. 
No, Sir. 


Sea. 
No letters for me? 


Rob. 
No, Sir. 


Sea. 
Nobody applying for franks? 


Rob. 
No, Sir. 



Sea. (aside.) 
Stupid dolts! 
(aloud.) 
So much the better. Be in the way when I call for you. 
(Exit Robert .) 
Well, this is strange enough: no body soliciting; no body coming to pay their court to me; no body asking me even for a frank: it is very strange! 
(after musing some time.) 
Hah! but there is a bad spirit in men, which makes them always unwilling at first to acknowledge the superiority of him who has been more nearly on a level with themselves. It is only when they see him firmly establish'd, and advancing in the path of honours, that they are forced to respect him. 
(after walking across 

[Page 399 ] 

the stage proudly.) 
And they shall see me advance. I am not a man to stop short at such beginnings [25]  as these, after the high connexions I have made: I feel that I am born for advancing. The embarrassment of public affairs at present, offers my activity a fair field for exertion. 
(A great noise and clamour heard without.) 
What is that? Who waits there? 
Enter Robert . 

What a cursed clamour and noise is this I hear? 


Rob. 
Only my Lady, Sir, who has been all over the house with Mrs. Pry, and laying down some prudent regulations for the family. 


Sea. 
And what have the servants to say to that? 


Rob. 
A pretty deal, Sir: they are no wise mealy mouthed about the matter; and they're all coming to your honour with it in a body. 

                                         (The noise without still coming nearer.) 


Sea. 
Don't let the angry fools come to me; I'll have nothing to do with it. Go tell them so. 


Rob. 
Very well, Sir; I'll be sure to tell them, he, he, he! 


Sea. 
What, sirrah! is it a joke for you? 


Rob. 
I didn't laugh, Sir. 



Sea. (very angry.) 
But you did, you damn'd fool! 



(Voices without.) 
I'll tell his honour of it, that I will. His honour is a good master, and has always kept his house like a gentleman. 


Sea. 
Did not I tell you not to let those angry [50]  ideots come to me. 

                                         (Exit by the opposite side from the noise, in great haste, whilst Robert pushes 

[Page 400 ] 

back the crowd of servants, who are seen pressing in at the door.) 


Rob. 
Get along all of you! his honour won't be disturb'd. 

                                         (Exeunt; a great clamour heard as they retire.) 

SCENE IV. 

Lady Sarah 's dressing-room. Enter Lady Sarah , followed by Sophia , carrying a work-basket in her hand, which she sets upon a work-table and sits down to work. 




Lady S. (sitting down by her.) 
Now I hope, Miss Seabright, I may flatter myself with having more of your company this morning than you generally favour me with. If Lord Allcrest does not come at an early hour, we shall have time for a good deal of work. When a young lady is industrious, and is not always reading nonsensical books, or running up and down after children, or watering two or three foolish flower-pots on her window, she can do a great many things for herself, that enable her to appear better dress'd than girls who are more expensive. 
(pausing.) 
You don't answer me. 


Soph. 
Indeed, Ma'am, I had better not, for I don't know what to say. 


Lady S. 
You are a very prudent young lady, indeed, to make that a reason for holding your tongue. 


Soph. 
It is a reason, indeed, which elder ladies do not always attend to. 


[Page 401 ] 



Lady S. 
What gown is that you have put on today? It makes you look like a child from the nursery.---Mr. Supplecoat is to accompany Lord Allcrest, who is a very promising young man, of good expectations, and I could have wish'd you [25]  had dress'd to more advantage. There is a young friend of mine, scarcely a year older than yourself, who is just going to be married to one of the best matches in the country; and it is of great importance to have a daughter of a large family well and early settled in life. 



Soph. (looking very much surprized.) 
O how different! My poor mother used to say, that young women ought not to be married too early, but wait till they had sense to conduct themselves at the head of a family. 


Lady S. 
Some of them would wait till they were pretty well wrinkled then. 


Soph. 
It must be confessed that some, who do wait till they are pretty well wrinkled, are fain at last to marry without it. 

                                         (Voices heard without.) 



Lady S. (rising quickly.) 
It is my brother's voice: he is come early. 

Enter Seabright , Lord Allcrest , and Sir Crafty Supplecoat . 



Lady S. 
My dear brother, I am rejoiced to see you. 

                                         (holding out her hand to Lord Allcrest , who salutes her, and then courtesying very graciously to Sir Crafty .) 


Lord A. 
I am happy to see you look so well, sister. 


[Page 402 ] 



Sir C. 
Lady Sarah looks as a bride ought to look, fair and chearful. 


Lady S. 
And Mr. Supplecoat talks as a courtier [50]  ought to talk, I need not say how. 


Lord A. 
I beg pardon! let me have the pleasure of introducing Sir Crafty Supplecoat to your Ladyship. 


Lady S. 
Every new honour that Sir Crafty acquires must give me pleasure. And permit me to introduce to your Lordship, Mr. Seabright's---I mean my daughter, who has many good qualities to make her worthy of your esteem. 

                                         (presenting Sophia to Lord All. and then to Sir Crafty , who afterwards modestly shrinks back, behind Lady S. ) 



Sea. (aside to Lady S. pulling her by the sleeve.) 
What, is he made a baronet? 



Lady S. (aside.) 
Yes. 



Sea. (aside.) 
A baronet, not a knight? 



Lady S. (aside.) 
No, no! a baronet, certainly. 



Sea. (aloud.) 
Permit me again to say how happy I am to see your Lordship in this house: I hope you and Sir Crafty will not run away from us so soon as your letter gave us reason to fear. 


Lord A. 
You are very obliging, my good Sir; but my time, as you may suppose, is of some little importance at present, and not altogether at my own command. 


Sir C. 
His Lordship's time has been so long devoted to the public, that he begins to believe it has a right to it. 


[Page 403 ] 




Lord A. (affecting humility.) 
Why, I have been [75]  placed, without any merit of my own, in a situation which gives my country some claims upon me: ever since the time of Gilbert, third Earl of Allcrest, the chiefs of my family have pursued one uniform line of public conduct. 


Sir C. 
For which they have been rewarded with one uniform stream of ministerial approbation.--- Changes of men and of measures have never been able to interrupt the happy and mutual uniformity. 


Lord A. 
I believe, indeed, without the imputation of vanity, I may boast of it. The imputation of pride I am not so anxious to avoid: it more naturally attaches itself to that dignified stability; that high integri---I mean that public virt---I should say--- 
(mumbling indistinctly to himself) 
which my family has been conspicuous for. 


Sir C. 
Pride is a fault that great men blush not to own---it is the enobled offspring of self-love; tho', it must be confess'd, grave and pompous vanity, like a fat plebeian in a robe of office, does very often assume its name. 


Lord A. 
Ha, ha, Sir Crafty! you have a pleasant imagination: one can see that you sometimes read books. 


Sir C. 
I would rather follow your example, my [100]  Lord, in the more agreeable study of men. No; I very seldom take a book in my hand, unless it be patronised by some great name, or have the honour, as has been the case with one of our best works lately, to be dedicated to your Lordship. 


[Page 404 ] 



Lord A. 
I am obliged to you, Supplecoat; I am sure I am very happy if a name of so little importance as mine can be of any use to the learned world. We all owe learning a great deal. 


Sir C. 
I am sure the patronage of your Lordship's name is a full recompense to learning for all the obligations you owe her. 



Lord A. (bowing graciously, and then turning to Seabright , as if modestly to interrupt the stream of his own praise.) 
Mr. Seabright, I must have a conversation with you in your library, when you can bestow as much leisure upon me. Most of our elections are already decided, and the ensuing parliament bids fair to be as united and as meritorious as its predecessor. In those places where I have the honour to possess some little influence, the constitution, the government, or ministry---that is to say the same thing, you know, will find hearty and zealous supporters: I think I may depend at least on the member for Crockdale. 

                                         (bowing.) 


Sea. 
I hope I shall always be found to merit the friendship and alliance I have the honour of bearing [125]  to your Lordship. 



Lord A. (drawing back coldly.) 
Friendship is always the strongest tye, Mr. Seabright: indeed the only one that is now held in any consideration, or indeed ever mention'd. 



Sea. (mortified and drawing back also.) 
I am ready to attend you, my Lord, whenever you please: I shall have the honour of shewing you the way to my library. 


[Page 405 ] 



Lord A. 
I am infinitely obliged to you. Will you go with us too, Sir Crafty? You have a list of the voters for Underwall in your pocket. The ladies will excuse us. 

                                         (Exeunt Lord All. Sir Crafty , and Sea. who goes out with them and re-enters almost immediately.) 



Sea. (to Lady S. ) 
His Lordship sent me back to borrow your spectacles. 


Lady S. 
Spectacles! I use no such thing. 


Sea. 
He says you do. 


Lady S. 
O yes, there is a particular kind which I sometimes look thro' to examine any thing very minutely. 

                                         (After receiving the spectacles and going to the door, he suddenly stops and turns back.) 


Sea. 
But is it your brother's interest that has made Supplecoat a baronet? 


Lady S. 
I dare say it is. 


Sea. 
Yes, yes! I make no doubt of it. 

                                         (Exit, hurrying away.) 



Lady S. (to Soph. angrily.) 
What made you, [150]  child, skulk behind backs so, like a simpleton? ---You can be fluent enough when there is no occasion for it, and when you ought to speak you have not a word to say for yourself. This is true nursery breeding. 


Soph. 
Indeed, Madam, you may thank yourself for it; for after what you said to me, before they arrived, about Sir Crafty Supplecoat and marrying, I could not bear to look at him; and every time he look'd at me, I felt strange and mortified, just 

[Page 406 ] 

as if I had been set there to be look'd at. He is the most disagreeable man I ever saw in my life. 


Lady S. 
Don't be uneasy; you have little chance, I'm afraid, of being molested by him. But I forget, I must write to my friend, Mrs. Cudimore; her husband is in credit now, and I have been too negligent a correspondent. 

                                         (Exit. 



Soph. (sighing deeply.) 
O dear! O dear! O dear me! she sleeps quietly under the green sod that I would right gladly lie down beside. 

                                         (Exit sorrowfully. 

SCENE V. 

A small room with Sophia 's books and music, and flower-pots, &c. set in order. Enter Sophia very sorrowful, leaning upon nurse . 



Soph. 
O my dear nurse! you are our best friend, and so she is going to send you away from us.--- What will become of the poor children now! What will become of us all by-and-bye! And my father too: even my father. Oh how it grieved me to see him courting that proud Lord, who seems ashamed to consider him as his brother-in-law! To see even my father look'd down upon---it goes to my heart. 


Nurse. 
Let him take what he gets, an' a murrain to him! he had no business to bring her here to torment us all, after the dear lady we have lost.--- But dry up your tears: we'll be revenged upon her: there is not a creature in the house that has not swore it: we'll be revenged upon her. 


[Page 407 ] 



Soph. 
What do you mean, nurse? 


Nurse. 
I must not tell you, my dear young lady; it is not proper that you should know any thing of it: but all the servants are joined in a plot, and they'll damp her courage, I warrant ye; they'll scare her finely. 



Soph. (skipping and clapping her hands.) 
O I shall be so glad to have her well scared! And I wish they would steal that nasty dog of her's, for she is [25]  kind to no living creature but it. 


Nurse. 
Nay, to give the devil his due, I believe she is growing fond of little Tony? 


Soph. 
Little Tony? 


Nurse. 
Yes indeed. It is strange enough, but the other day as she pass'd thro' the hall, we were all looking sourly enough upon her no doubt, when, what possess'd the child I don't know, but he held out his arms to her and smiled. 


Suph. 
Nasty little toad! to hold out his arms to her! 


Nurse. 
And, would you believe it, she took him in her arms, kiss'd him very kindly, and has taken to him wonderfully ever since. 


Soph. 
And do you think she really loves him? 


Nurse. 
Upon my honest word I do. 


Soph. 
O then, don't let them do any harm to her! don't let them take any revenge upon her! if she love Tony, I would not have her hurt. 


Nurse. 
O but she loves none of the rest; she is as hard as a millstone to the other two. O la! here comes that fine Sir Crafty, as they call him: I wonder 

[Page 408 ] 

what can bring him here: can he be coming after you, Miss Sophy? 
(with a significant smile.) 


Soph. 
Now don't say so, nurse, for you know I [50]  can't bear it. 

(Enter Sir Crafty Supplecoat , advancing to Sophia with a very courteous smiling face, whilst she shrinks back and keeps close to nurse .) 




Soph. (aside.) 
O don't go, nurse! 


Sir C. 
Lady Sarah has had the goodness, Miss Seabright, to send to you a very willing messenger, who is happy to find any pretence in the world to present himself before you. 



Nurse. (aside to Soph. ) 
It is just as I said. 
(aloud to Sir C. ) 
Meaning yourself, Sir? 


Sir C. 
Yes; well guess'd, nurse! you are cunning enough I see; you have the true sagacity about you that becomes your occupation; and I doubt not that your young lady has profited by your very instructive society. Now that you have found out the messenger, perhaps she may guess what his errand is. 

                                         (with an affected leer.) 



Nurse. (aside to Sophia , who shrinks back still more.) 
Ay, it is very like courting I assure you. 



Sir C. (advancing as she recedes.) 
Will not Miss Seabright do me the honour to bestow one thought upon it? I cannot doubt of her ability to guess my errand, if she will have the condescension. 



Nurse. (aside to Soph. ) 
Yes, yes! it is the very thing: I have heard many a courtship begin after this fashion. 


[Page 409 ] 




Soph. (to Sir C. very much embarrassed and frightened.) 
I---I---I'm sure I don't know. 



Sir C. (still advancing towards her as she recedes, with a more intolerable leer on his face.) 
Nay, do [75]  have the goodness to give me this proof of the skill you have acquired in this refined academy of improvement, and tell me on what errand I am come. 



Soph. (becoming angry.) 
I'm sure I don't know, unless it be to make a fool of me, and I don't think I need to stay any longer for that purpose. 
(runs out.) 



Nurse. (running after her.) 
Don't run away, Miss Sophy! he is a good looking gentleman, and very civil spoken too. 

                                         (Exit. 



Sir C. (looking after them:) 
Ha, ha, ha! 

(Enter Sharp at the side by which they have gone out.) 



Sharp. 
You are merry, Sir: I believe I can guess what amuses you. 


Sir C. 
I dare say thou canst, Sharp; it is easy enough to see what they have got into their foolish heads. Ha, ha, ha! does the political Lady Sarah think to put off her troublesome nursery girl upon Crafty Supplecoat. But let me encourage the mistake for a little, it will strengthen my interest with Lord Allcrest, which at present is necessary to me. Thou understand'st me, Sharp. 


Sharp. 
Yes, yes, Sir; and you will have little trouble in keeping it up, for the servants, thanks to Mrs. Pry's gossiping, who is in her lady's secrets, have got it so strongly into their heads, that if you but pick up the young lady's glove when she 

[Page 410 ] 

[100]  drops it, they think you are putting a ring on her finger. 


Sir C. 
I thank thee Sharp; and if thou cans't at any time pick up, in thine own way, any information that may be useful to me, thou shalt not go without thy reward. And how does the young lady like her step-mother's scheme? hast thou heard them talk about that? 


Sharp. 
Nay, they say she dislikes it very much, and is deucedly shy about it. 



Sir C. (smiling conceitedly.) 
Poo, poo, poo! She must be allowed to have her little management as well as older people: deceit is inherent in the human mind. I came here at Lady Sarah's desire to request that she would bring her music book into the drawing room, and play to us; and she took it into her head---but what brought you here to seek me? Is the horse-dealer come to look at my ponies? 


Sharp. 
Yes, Sir. 


Sir C. 
Then I must go to him. 

                                         (Exit Sir Crafty , whilst Sharp remains behind, musing, as if in serious thought about something.) 
(Enter Robert in a great rage.) 



Rob. 
Ay! what damn'd tricks are you thinking of? I have overheard, at the door here, all that you and your vile master have been saying. My young lady to be made fool of for his conveniency, indeed! [125]  She's a match for a better man than him any day in the year; there is not a lord of the land too 

[Page 411 ] 

good for her. But I'll be revenged upon him, vile serpent that he is! I'll be revenged upon him! 


Sharp. 
Well, don't be so loud, my good Robert, and you will perhaps be satisfied. He has twice promised to get me a place or to raise my wages for me, and if he break his word with me a third time,---I know what. Come man, let us go and have a glass together. 

                                         (Exeunt. 
END OF THE SECOND ACT.


[Page 412 ] 


ACT III. 

SCENE I. 

A small country inn near Seabright 's house. Enter Beaumont, Morgan , and William Beaumont . 




Bea. (to Mor.) 
Well, my good Sir, how do you like travelling once more a little easy forenoon's journey in your native country? 


Mor. 
Every thing in my native country is pleasant to me, or at least ought to be so: but I don't know; I return to it again like a dog to a deserted house; he begins to wag his tail at the threshold, but there is no body to welcome him in: there is another generation grown up that knows not me; there is nothing but young people now in the world. 


Bea. 
But those young people will love and esteem you, and honour you. The caresses even of cheerful infancy go very kindly to an old man's heart. Come, come! you shall see the promising family your niece has left behind her, and your heart will warm to them. Seabright has, I fear, set an ungracious step-mother over their head; but she, perhaps, looks more so than she is.---Here comes our landlady. 

[Page 413 ] 

(Enter Landlady .) 

Good morning, Mrs. Thrifty. 



Land. (to Bea. ) 
O Sir! I be glad to see you! 


Bea. 
I thank you good landlady: take good care of my wife. 


Land. 
[25]  That I will, Sir; she's in the green chamber, giving orders to her maid. And this young gentleman is your son, I suppose. 

                                         (turning, and courtesying to Wil. ) 


Bea. 
Yes, my good ma'am. 


Land. 
Blessings on him! Ay! if he be like his father, the blessings of the widow and the helpless will rest upon him.---You are going to the Squire's I suppose? 


Bea. 
Yes, landlady; how does the family do? 


Land. 
O lud, Sir! what an alter'd family it be! the servants a-grumbling; the lady a-scolding; the Squire himself going up and down like a man possess'd, as they tell me, and can't sleep in his bed o' nights for writing to dukes and lords and such like, and tormenting himself, poor man, just to be made a Sir or a Knight, or some nonsense or other of that kind:---and then all the poor children; it grives me to see them like so many chickens that have got no dam to gather them together, tho' I'm sure that dear good young lady does all that she can for them: I sees her every morning from the room overhead, which overlooks their garden, walking with them as if she were the mother of them all, tho' I warrant you she's soon snubb'd into the house again: O it grieves me to see them! 


[Page 414 ] 




Will. (eagerly.) 
[50]  In the room overhead did you say? and in the morning? about this time? 


Land. 
I don't know if just at this very time. 


Will. 
I dare she is. 

                                         (going out eagerly.) 


Bea. 
But you wanted to read that paragraph about your friend, William, and here is the newspaper just come. 



Will. (impatiently.) 
O hang it! not now: I don't care if I never read it. 

                                         (Exit quickly. 



Bea. (to Land. ) 
And he can't sleep in his bed, they say, for writing letters to great people? 


Land. 
Yes Sir, so they say; but there may be other reasons for a man not resting in his bed. 


Bea. 
And what other reasons may there be? 


Land, 
Sir, my grandfather was sexton of the parish, and would have thought nothing of digging you a grave in a dark winter evening, or ringing the church bell in the middle of the night, with never a living creature near him but his dog and his lantern, and I have myself sat up with dead corpses ere now, and I can't but say they always lay very quietly when I was with them; therefore I'm not a very likely person, you know, to give heed to foolish stories about ghosts and such like. Howsomever, the servants say that they hear strange [75]  noises since their new lady came home; and some of them swears that they have heard their late lady's footsteps walking along the hall in the middle of the night, as plainly as when she was alive. 


Bea. 
That is strange enough, landlady, 


[Page 415 ] 



Land. 
To be sure it is, Sir, but what shall we say against it; for if miser's come back to the world again to look after their gold, why may not a mother come back to it again to look after her children, oppress'd by a hard hearted step-mother? 


Bea. 
Indeed, it would be difficult in this case to gainsay it. But let us have coffee in the next room, I pray you, as soon as you can. 


Land. 
Immediately, Sir. 

                                         (Exit Landlady . 


Bea. 
This is a strange untoward account that our good landlady gives us of the family. One can find out, however, that domestic comfort is no more the lot of poor Seabright---but we shall see when we go to him what state he is in. 


Mor. 
You will see yourself then, for I shan't go to him at all. 


Bea. 
No! don't say so, my good friend: he was an affectionate husband to your niece, and an indulgent father to her children: 
( Mor. shakes his head.) 
When his wife died, his old habits were [100]  broken up; he is of an aspiring disposition; a high alliance and a borough presented themselves to him, and he fell into the snare. 
( Mor. still shakes his head.) 
He has married a woman who is narrow minded naturally; but that disposition has been strengthened by circumstances: she has long been left, as a single woman, to support high rank upon a very small income, and has lived much with those to whom begging and solicitations are no disgrace: differently circumstanced she might have been 

[Page 416 ] 

more respectable, and when differently circumstanced she may become so. 


Mor. 
Go to him thyself, Beaumont: I am an old man; my life's bark has been long buffeted about on a stormy sea, and I have seen cruel sights. I do not look upon my fellow-men with the same gentle eye as thou dost: I cannot love them myself, but I love thee because thou dost it: so e'en take me home to thine own house; no other house will I enter; and let me have an arm chair by thy fire-side to end my days in, where I may sit at my ease and grumble at the whole human race. 


Bea. 
No, no! you shall see all your relations; and love them too, and do what is right by every [125]  one of them. 


Mor. 
Do it for me then: I can't be troubled with it. Take my fortune into your own hands, and dispose of it as you please. 


Bea. 
No; you shall do it yourself; and the blessings of those you bestow it upon shall fall on your own head undivided and unintercepted. 


Mor. 
I will take the simplest and shortest way of settling my fortune; I will give it all to your son. 



Bea. (stretching himself up with a proud smile.) 
Yes, if he will have it. 

(Enter William B. with great animation.) 



Will. 
I've seen her father! I've seen her! 


Bea. 
Who have you seen? 


[Page 417 ] 



Will. 
My cousin Sophy: She is in the garden just now with all the children about her; and they have pulled off her hat in their play, and she looks so pretty---I---I mean good humour'd, and--- 



Bea. (smiling.) 
There is no harm in calling her pretty, William.---But Mr. Morgan has got something very serious to say to you: he wishes to settle his fortune upon you. 


Wil. 
His whole fortune upon me! 


Mor. 
Yes, my brave William, every shilling of it. 


Will. 
What! and Sophia and all the little Sea-brights, [150]  who are as nearly related to you, to have nothing? 


Mor. 
It shall be all your own. 



Will. (with great vehemence.) 
Hang me then if I take one sixpence more than my own share! 


Mor. 
Ah! I see how it is: I am a blasted tree from which no sapling shoots: my grey hairs are despised. 


Will. 
O say not so, my good Sir! 
(bending one knee to the ground, and kissing the old man's hand.) 
I will bow my head as affectionately beneath your blessing as the most dutiful child. But you shall have many children to respect and love you! and one of them---O you shall see one of them that will make your heart leap with pleasure! 

                                         (hurrying away.) 


Bea. 
Where are you going in such haste? 


Will. 
Never mind; I'll soon return. 

                                         (Exit. 


[Page 418 ] 




Mor. (to Bea. who looks significantly to him.) 
Yes, my friend, he was sent to you from him who has given you many blessings. 


Bea. 
But none like this. 
(fervently.) 
He is a brave and upright spirit, passing with me thro' this world to a better. When he was but so high, yea but so high, how his little heart would spurn at all injustice! 

(Enter Mrs. Beaumont .) 



Mrs. B. 
Where is William? 


Bea. 
[175]  He is gone over the way I believe to fetch Sophia here. 


Mrs. B. 
I'm glad of that: I came here only to see her, and I will never enter Seabright's door again, as long as I live. 


Bea. 
"As long as I live," my dear, is a phrase of very varied significations: it means the term of an angry woman's passion, or a fond woman's fancy, or a--- 


Mrs. B. 
Or a good man's simplicity, Mr. Beaumont. Do you think I will ever enter the house where that woman is the mistress; unfeeling, undelicate, uncivil? 


Bea. 
But she won't squander his fortune, however, and that is a good thing for the children. 


Mrs. B. 
Poo, Mr. Beaumont! the wickedest creature on earth has always your good word for some precious quality or other. 


Beo. 
Well, my dear, and the wickedest creature in the world always has something about it, that shews whose creature it is---that shews we were all 

[Page 419 ] 

meant for a good end; and that there is a seed---a springing place---a beginning for it in every body. 


Mrs. B. 
It is a very small speck with her, then, I'm sure, and would elude any body's search but [200]  your own. 


Bea. 
Now, Mr. Morgan, don't think hardly of my wife's disposition because she is angry at present: I assure you she is a very good woman, and has an excellent heart: She is in all things better than myself, tho' I'm of a more composed disposition. 



Mrs. B. (softened.) 
My dear Beaumont! I chide you as a child, and I honour you as a man! But no more of this.---Does William tell Sophia that she is to meet her great uncle here? 


Mor. 
I hope he will not: I should wish to be unknown for some time, that I may observe and determine for myself, since you will make me act for myself. 


Bea. 
Go then into the next room with Mrs. Beaumont: I'll wait for them here, and if he has not told her already, I'll desire him to conceal it. I hear them coming, 

                                         (Exeunt Mrs. B. and Morgan . 
(Enter William B. leading in Sophia .) 



Soph. 
But who are you taking me to see? 


Will. 
You shall know by-and-bye.---But do stop a moment, Sophy, and pull back the hat a little from your face; you look best with it so. 
(stopping and putting her hat to rights.) 
That will do.--- And throw away that foolish basket out of your hands 
(taking a flower basket from her, in which she 

[Page 420 ] 

seems to have been gathering rose leaves, and throwing it away.) 
[225]  and pray now hold up your head a little better. 


Soph. 
But what is all this preparation for? 

                                         ( Bea. who had retired to the bottom of the stage, unobserved by them, now advances softly behind Soph. and makes a sign to William to be silent.) 


Wil. 
You are to see somebody that loves you very much, and likes to see you look well, you know; you are to see your aunt. 


Soph. 
But there is somebody else you told me of. 


Wil. 
Yes, there is an old connexion of ours with her; and pray now, Sophy, look pleasantly upon him; for he is an old man, and has met with misfortunes; he has been in foreign countries; he has been in prisons, and has had chains on his legs. 


Soph. 
O then, I am sure I shall look upon him kindly! 

                                         (Exeunt Soph. and Wil. followed at a distance by Beaumont .) 

SCENE II. 

A large room in Seabright 's house. Lady Sarah is discovered sitting by a table writing, near the bottom of the stage. 



Lady S. 
There is so much light thrown across my paper here, it makes me almost blind. Who's there? is it you, Pry? 

(Enter Pry from the adjoining room.) 



Pry. 
Yes, my Lady; I sits in this room here pretty often, for the servants are vulgar and rude 

[Page 421 ] 

to me, and my own room is so lonesome I can't bear to be in it. Not that I hear any of them noises, excepting in the night time; yet I can't help thinking of it all day long when I am alone.---First it comes to my door, "lowe, lowe, lowe!" just like a great bull: then it comes presently after, "scrie, scrie, scrie!" just like a raven, or a cock, or a cat, or any of those wild animals; and then for the groans that it gives---O! an old jack that has not been oil'd for a twelve-month is a joke to it. 



Lady S. (gravely.) 
Remove this table for me to the other end of the room; it is too much in the sun here. 
( Pry removes the table near the front of the stage, and Lady S. sits down to write again, without speaking; then looking up and seeing Pry still by her.) 
Leave me. 


Pry. 
I'm just going, my Lady. I believe I told you, my Lady, that Robert tells me, the vicar always expects the present of a new gown and cassock, when he is sent for to lay a ghost in any genteel house. 


Lady S. 
[25]  Leave me, I say; I'll hear no more of that nonsense at present. 

                                         (Exit Pry , and enter Seabright .) 


Sea. 
What has that absurd creature been chattering about? 


Lady S. 
Still about those strange noises. 


Sea. 
I thought so; every noise is a thief or a ghost with her. Who are you writing to? 


Lady S. 
I am writing to Lady Puler, to beg she will have the goodness to send me a few lines by 

[Page 422 ] 

return of post, to let me know how her rheumatism does: her husband, you know, may have it in his power to serve you. 



Sea. (nodding.) 
That is very right, my dear. 


Lady S. 
And here is a letter I have just written to Lady Mary Markly: she is a spiteful toad, and I never could endure her; but she is going to be married for the third time to a near relation of the minister's, and it will be proper in me, you know, to be very much interested in her approaching happiness. 


Sea. 
Yes, perfectly right, my dear Lady Sarah; I won't interrupt you. 

                                         (sits down.) 


Lady S. 
Indeed, my dear Seabright, I have been in the habit of studying these things, and I know how to make my account in it. If people would but attend to it, every acquaintance that they [50]  make, every letter that they write, every dinner that they give, might be made to turn to some advantage. 



Sea. (hastily, with marks of disgust.) 
No, no! that is carrying it too far! 


Lady S. 
Not at all, Mr. Seabright! I sent a basket of the best fruit in your garden this morning even to old Mrs. Pewterer, the Mayor of Crockdale's mother-in-law, and I dare say it won't be thrown away. 



Sea. (smiling.) 
Well, that, however, was very well thought of. But I interrupt you. 
(she continues to write, and he sits musing for some time, then speaking to himself.) 
A baronet of Great Britain and 

[Page 423 ] 

seven thousand a year! 
(smiling to himself.) 
Ay, that would be a resting place at which I could put up my horses and say, I have done enough. A baronet of Great Britain, and seven thousand a year! 



Lady S. (looking up from her paper.) 
A baronet of Great Britain you will soon be; this day's post, I trust, will inform you of that honour being conferred upon you; but the seven thousand a year, I wish we were as sure of having that added to it. 


Sea. 
I wish we were; but Mr. Plausible has been with me last night, and has pointed out a way to me, in which, by venturing a considerable capital [75]  on very small risk, a most prodigious gain might be made; and in which, money laid out--- 



Lady S. (interrupting him eagerly.) 
Will never return any more! 
(getting up alarmed.) 
Pray, pray, my dear Seabright, don't frighten me! The very idea of such a scheme will throw me into a fit.--- Don't let that man enter the house any more---he is a dark-eyed, needy-looking man---don't let him come here any more. 


Sea. 
Why what alarms you so much? he is a very uncommon man, and a man of genius. 


Lady S. 
Keep him out of the house then, for heaven's sake! there is never any good got by admitting men of genius; and you may keep them all out of your house, I'm sure, without being very inhospitable. 


Sea. 
Your over-caution will be a clog upon my fortune 


[Page 424 ] 



Lady S. 
A clog upon your fortune, Mr. Seabright! Am not I doing every thing that a woman can do to advance it? am not I writing letters for you? making intimacies for you? paying visits for you? teazing every body that is related to me within the fiftieth degree of consanguinity for you?---and is this being a clog upon your fortune? 


Sea. 
[100]  Well, well! we shall see what it all comes to. 


Lady S. 
Yes, we shall see; this very post will inform you of our success; I'm sure of it; and see, here are the letters. 

                                         (Enter Pry with letters, which she gives to Sea. ; and then puts one down on the table for Lady Sarah , who is so busy looking at Seabright 's that she does not perceive it.) 



Lady S. (to Pry , who seems inclined to stay.) 
Don't wait; I shall call when I want you. 

                                         (Exit Pry. 



Sea. (opening a letter and running his eye over it eagerly.) 
Hang it! it is about the altering of a turnpike road. 
(throws it away impatiently, and opens another letter which he reads in like manner.) 
Stuff and nonsense about friendship, and old acquaintance, and so on! What a parcel of fools there are in the world! Ha! what seal is this? 
(opening another letter eagerly.) 
Hell and the devil! it is a letter from your brother, and only a common place letter of compliment, with never a word on the subject! 
(Tearing the letters in a rage, and strewing them upon the floor.) 
Cursed be pen, ink, and paper, and every one that puts his trust in them! 


[Page 425 ] 



Lady S. 
Don't destroy the blank sides of your letters, Mr. Seabright, they will do to write notes upon. 


Sea. 
O confound your little minute economy, Lady Sarah! it comes across me every now and then like the creeping of a spider: it makes me mad. 



Lady S. (putting aside her papers, much offended.) 
[125]  I think I need scarcely give myself the trouble of writing any more to-day. 
(seeing the letter on her table.) 
Ha! a letter from my brother to me! 
(opening it.) 
and a later date I fancy than that which you have received. 

                                         (reads it with her countenance brightening up.) 



Sea. (looking eagerly at her.) 
What's in it? 
(she is silent.) 
What's in it? for God's sake tell me! 



Lady S. (going up to him with a smiling face, and an affected formal courtesy.) 
I have the honour to congratulate Sir Anthony Seabright. 


Sea. 
Is it really so? Is it really so? Let me see, let me see. 
(snatches the letter from her and reads it.) 
O it is so in very truth!---Give me your hand, my dear Lady Sarah! and give me a kiss too. 
(kisses her on one cheek, and she graciously turns to him the other.) 
O one will do very well.---Where are all the children? let every soul in the house come about me!---No, no, no! let me be decent; let me be moderate. 

(Enter Plausible .) 




Sea. (going up joyfully to him.) 
How do you do? how do you do, my very good friend? 


[Page 426 ] 




Lady S. (pulling Sea. by the sleeve.) 
You know you are engaged; you can't speak with any body at present. 


Sea. 
I can do all I have to do very well, and give a quarter of an hour to Mr. Plausible, notwithstanding. 



Lady S. (still pulling him.) 
You have many letters [150]  to write, and many other things.---You understand me? 


Plau. 
I shall have the pleasure of calling then to-morrow morning. 


Lady S. 
He is engaged to-morrow morning. 


Plau. 
And in the evening also? 


Lady S. 
Yes, Sir, and every hour in the day.--- He has not yet laid out his fortune to such advantage as will enable him to bestow quite so much leisure time upon his friends as Mr. Plausible. 


Plau. 
I can never regret the leisure time I have upon my hands, since it has given me an opportunity of obliging your Ladyship: I have procured the inestimable receipt for whitening linen without soap that I mention'd to you, and I shall bring it to you to-morrow. 


Lady S. 
Pray don't take the trouble! I am much obliged to you: but we are all so much occupied! 
(to Sea. ) 
Are not you going to write by return of post? 



Sea. (to Plau. ) 
I am really much engaged at present: the King has been graciously pleased, tho' most unworthy of it, and most unlook'd for on my part, to honour me with the dignity of a baronet of Great Britain. 


[Page 427 ] 



Plau. 
[175]  I rejoice, my dear Sir, I congratulate you with all my heart; and I have the honour to congratulate your Ladyship also. 


Lady S. 
I thank you, Sir---good morning---good morning. 



Sea. (to Plau. ) 
Trifling as these things may be, yet as a mark of royal favour--- 



Lady S. (impatiently.) 
Yes, yes; he knows all that well enough.---Good morning. 
(to Plau. ) 
You will positively have no time to write your letters by the return of post. 
(to Sea. pulling him away, who bows to Plau. and goes with her unwillingly. Turning round suddenly to Plau. as they are just going out.) 
Whitening linen without soap? 


Plau. 
Yes, Madam; and no expence of any kind in the business. 


Lady S. 
When you are passing this way, at any rate, I should be glad to look at it. 


Plau. 
I shall have the honour very soon of calling upon your Ladyship. 


Lady S. 
You are very obliging. You will excuse us; you will excuse us, Mr. Plausible; we are really obliged to be extremely rude to you. 

                                         (Exeunt Lady S. and Sea. ) 



Plau. (alone.) 
Ha, ha, ha! I shall keep hold still I find. 
                                         (Enter Prowler , looking cautiously about as he enters.) 
What do you want? 


Pro. 
Unless you want to be laid up by the heels, [200]  don't go out of this house by the same door that 

[Page 428 ] 

you enter'd it. I have waited in the passage here to tell you. 


Plau. 
Ha! have they found me out? 


Pro. 
Yes, by my faith, there are two as ugly looking fellows waiting for you at the front entry as ever made a poor debtor's heart quake. There is surely some back door in this house. 
(Enter Robert .) 


(to Rob. ) 
My good friend, I want to know where we can find a back way out of this house. 


Rob. 
And I want to know when I am to have the crown I intrusted to you. 


Pro. 
To me, Sir? 


Rob. 
Yes, to you, Sir; and you know it very well, you do. 


Pro. 
O! you are my friend Robert, that I was enquiring after. 


Rob. 
Yes, Sir; and I will have my money directly; for I know you are a cheat; I know it by your very face. 


Pro. 
Ha, ha, ha! So you prefer having a crown to-day to receiving ten guineas to-morrow. 


Rob. 
Receiving ten fiddle-strings to-morrow! pay me my crown directly. 


Pro. 
Very well, with all my heart; but you must [225]  sign me a paper, in the first place, giving up all right to the ten guineas you are entitled to. 
( Robert hesitates.) 
Nay, nay, I'm not such an ass as you take me for: there is pen, ink, and paper; 
(pointing to the table.) 
Sign me a right to the ten guineas directly. 


[Page 429 ] 




Rob. (scratching his head.) 
Well, we'll let it stand if you please till another time. 


Pro. 
I thought so: faith you're too cunning for me! But shew us the way to the back door, quickly. 


Rob. 
And should you like to come that way tomorrow, when you bring me the money? I shall be sure to be in the way to let you in. 


Pro. 
Let us out by the back door to-day, and let me in to-morrow by any door you please. 

                                         (Exeunt. 
END OF THE THIRD ACT.


[Page 430 ] 


ACT IV. 

SCENE I. 

Seabright 's library. Enter Seabright , as if from a short journey, and the Eldest Boy running after him. 



Boy. 
O papa, papa! I'm glad you're come back again! And have you said over your speech to the Parliament? and did they say any fine speeches back again to you? 


Sea. 
Go away, George: I'm fatigued; I can't speak to you now. 

(Enter Robert .) 



Rob. 
Won't your honour have some refreshment after your journey? My Lady is gone out an airing; you had better have something. 


Sea. 
No, nothing, Robert.---A glass of water, if you please. 

                                         (sits down grave and dispirited, whilst Robert fetches the water, and the Boy plays about the room.) 



Rob. (presenting the water.) 
I'll warrant now that you have had a power of fine talking in this Parliament house; and I warrant your honour's speech was as well regarded as any of it. 


Sea. 
I thank you, Robert: I am fatigued, and would be alone for a little: take that boy away in 

[Page 431 ] 

your hand. 
(Exeunt Rob. and the Boy , and Sea . remains sometime musing with a dissatisfied face; then speaking to himself.) 
"The conciseness with which the Honourable Baronet who spoke last has treated this question." Ah! but I was,---I was too concise! The whole train of connecting and illustrative thoughts, which I had been at so much pains, before hand, to fix and arrange in my head, vanish'd [25]  from me as I rose to speak; and nothing of all that I had prepared presented itself before me, but the mere heads of the subject, standing up barren and bare, like so many detach'd rocks in a desert land. 
(starting up.) 
This will never do! I'm sure I have not spared myself: I have labour'd night and day at this speech: I have work'd at it like a slave in a mine; and yet, when I came to the push, it deceived me. 
(shaking his head.) 
This will never do! let me rest satisfied with what I have got, and think of being a speaker no more. 
(stands despondingly for a little while, with his arms across, then suddenly becoming animated.) 
No! I will not give it up! I saw an old school-fellow of mine in the lobby, as I went out, who whisper'd to the person standing next him as I pass'd, that I was his townsman. Does not this look as if my speech, even such as I was enabled to give it, had been approved of? O, I will not give it up! This is the only way to high distinction: I must drudge and labour still. Heigh ho! 
(yawning grievously. A gentle tap is heard at the door.) 
Who's there? 
(angrily.) 



Soph. (without.) 
May I come in, papa? 


[Page 432 ] 



Sea. 
Yes, yes; but what do you want? 

(Enter Sophia , timidly.) 



Soph. 
I only come, my dear Sir, to see how you do after your journey. But you don't look well, [50]  papa: you don't look happy: has any thing distress'd you? 


Sea. 
No, my good girl. 



Soph. (kissing his hand.) 
I thank you, papa, for calling me your good girl: I was your good girl. 


Sea. 
And are so still, my dear Sophia; but you must sometimes excuse me; I am not very happy. 


Soph. 
Ah papa! I know what makes you unhappy. 



Sea. (shaking his head.) 
Thou dost not! thou dost not! 


Soph. 
Ah but I do! and nobody told it me neither ---I can just see it my ownself. You are giving yourself a great deal of trouble, and courting very proud and very disagreeable people, for what you very probably won't get; and you are grieved to think that Lady Sarah does not treat us so kindly as she might do. But don't be unhappy: don't court those proud people any more: you have enough to live upon as you used to do; and Lady Sarah will be kinder to us by-and-bye. I know she will; for she loves little Tony already; and if she should not we will never complain. 



Sea. (kissing her.) 
My sweet child! thou deservest ---O thou deservest more than I can ever do for thee! 


[Page 433 ] 




Soph. (gladly.) 
[75]  Do you say so, indeed? O then do this for me! 


Sea. 
What is it, Sophia? 


Soph. 
Trouble yourself no more with great people, and studying of speeches for that odious Parliament; and when Lady Sarah is out of the way, let the children come and play about you again, as they used to do. 



Sea. (tenderly.) 
I thank you, my good child, but you don't understand these things. 
(Walks thoughtfully across the room, and then returns to her again.) 
There is an office which Lord Allcrest has promised to procure for me, that would bring me a considerable and permanent addition to my income; if I once had that secured, I believe, in truth, it would be no unwise thing in me to follow your advice. 


Soph. 
O, my dear Sir, I hope you will have it then! 
(skipping joyfully.) 
I hope you will have it. 

                                         (Enter a Servant , and announces Sir Crafty Supplecoat .) 


Sea. 
Sir Crafty here! can any thing have happen'd for me? 


Soph. 
O if it should be the place!---But shall I go away? for I don't like to see that man. 


Sea. 
No, my dear, stay with me; I like to have you beside me. 


Soph. 
Then I will stay; for I am happy now, and I can look upon him boldly. 

(Enter Sir Crafty Supplecoat .) 



Sea. 
[100]  Sir Crafty, your servant; I'm very happy to see you. 


[Page 434 ] 



Sir C. 
Your servant, Sir Anthony; I'm happy in being able to pay you my respects.---Miss Seabright I hope is well. 
(bowing to Soph. who returns his civility with chearfulness.) 
Indeed, Sir Anthony, I have long'd ever since I heard your speech in the House, which, for a maiden speech---Well, I will not say what it was.---I have long'd to declare to you the extreme pleasure I take in the fair career that is now open'd before you, and in being permitted to consider myself as one of your friends. 


Sea. 
You do me great honour: I am infinitely obliged to you. My speech indeed ought---it ought to have--- 

                                         (hesitating.) 


Sir C. 
To have been just what it was, my dear Baronet. Your friends enjoy'd it; and, let me say it freely, without envy. 


Sea. 
I am much flatter'd: their praises are--- are--- 

                                         (hesitating.) 


Sir C. 
Are proportion'd to their admiration, Sir Anthony; and they have great pleasure in talking of it. 



Sea. (eagerly.) 
Ha! do they talk much of it? 


Sir C. 
Yes; more than I would venture to repeat [125]  to you. 


Sea. 
Friends, indeed, say many things that ought not to be believed. 


Sir C. 
I assure you, your's say many things which one of the qualities you so eminently possess would not, perhaps, suffer you to believe. Eloquence ---eloquence, my dear Sir---great things are to be attain'd in this country by eloquence. Eloquence 

[Page 435 ] 

and high connexions give a man such velocity in moving, that nothing can stop his career.--- But I ought to tell you, by-the-bye, that old Saunter is dead, unexpectedly; and that office, if it indeed can be consider'd as any object to you now, is ready for-your acceptance. 



Soph. (aside to Sea. ) 
Is that the office, papa? 


Sea. 
Yes, child; hold your tongue. 
(aloud.) 
I am obliged to you for this intelligence, Sir Crafty: an office for life, tho' not very considerable, is of some consequence to a man who has a family of children. 

                                         ( Soph. takes her father's hand and presses it gratefully.) 


Sir C. 
Ha, ha, ha! Sir Anthony Seabright, with all his abilities and connexions, is, like a very good father, anxious to provide for his family! I thought, my dear Sir, such talents as your's had generally been accompanied with an aspiring temper; but [150]  Lady Sarah's prudent character, I perceive, has had its effect upon you. 


Sea. 
No, no; you are wrong. 


Sir C. 
Nay, pardon me if I say that you also are wrong, in fixing yourself down, in the very beginning of your career, as a quiet unaspiring man, who is glad to be early provided for in a quiet, humble permanency: for this office, you know, is regarded as--- 



Sea. (interrupting him eagerly.) 
What, is it regarded in that light? 


Sir C. 
It really is. Mr. Trotman, now promoted to a peerage, and whose first speech, by-the-bye 

[Page 436 ] 

very much resembled your own, refused it on that very account; and Mr. Brown, and Mr. Wilson, and Sir Samuel Soppet, and many other Misters and Sirs, promoted to the same dignity, would never have got on, be assured, if they had thus fixed themselves down at the very threshold of advancement. 


Sea. 
But I see no reason why accepting such an office as this, should hinder one from advancing. 


Sir C. 
I can give you no good reason for it, I confess; but there have been certain places, time out of mind, which have, some how or other, been consider'd as indicative or otherwise of promotion, [175]  and which stand up in the great field of honours like finger posts in a wide track'd common, saying "this is the way to such a place:" they who are once certain of those places, move on to the others, for no earthly reason, that we can perceive, but because they have been placed in the first; and this you will readily allow is no time for innovation. 


Sea. 
I believe there is something in what you say. 


Sir. C. 
There is so much in it, that if you can find some less aspiring friend, to whom you can with confidence give up this office, relying on his honour to assist you with the full weight of his interest on all future occasions, I am sure you will never think of accepting it. 



Soph. (laying hold of her father's arm, and speaking eagerly to Sir Crafty ) 
Ah, but he will tho'! 


[Page 437 ] 



Sea. 
Sophia, you forget yourself. 

                                         (she shrinks back abash'd.) 



Sir C. (smiling.) 
It is an amiable weakness in this interested age to forget yourself, and confined, I believe, to young ladies alone. 



Soph. (provoked and roused.) 
I believe, at least, political baronets, tho' not very old, do but seldom fall into it. 
(archly.) 
And I know, papa, who this friend is that will so kindly take this office off your hands. Sir Crafty will name him to you by-and-bye: [200]  it is a man who does not forget himself. 



Sea. (displeased.) 
What is the meaning of this, Sophia? I never saw you thus petulant before: I beg of you to retire; Sir Crafty and I must not be interrupted. 


Soph. 
I will retire, my dear Sir---but oh! 
(taking her father's hand and pressing it.) 
but oh!---you know what I would say to you. 

                                         (Exit, casting a significant look to Seabright as she goes out.) 



Sea. (after a considerable pause.) 
Sir Crafty, there is much in what you say, and I believe you are perfectly disinterested in the advice you give me; but I don't know that I could justify myself to my own mind in refusing this office. 


Sir C. 
There are few men less interested than myself; I will say it, Sir Anthony; I will say it proudly.---Pardon me, however, I do not presume to advise you; but hearing Lord Clacker, and the Marquis of Lackland, and some others, talking of your speech, and the usual race of such abilities, and so forth, many suggestions arose in my mind, 

[Page 438 ] 

in regard to you, my dear Sir, which I very naturally supposed just now might have presented themselves to your own. 


Sea. 
Ha! did Lord Clacker and the Marquis of Lackland talk of my speech, and my abili---I [225]  mean the probable effects of my situation and connexions? 


Sir C. 
I assure you they spoke of both in a way very gratifying for a friend, so much interested in your promotion as I am, to hear---but remember, I give you no advice: I am a young man, and apt, perhaps, to be too sanguine where the admiration of talents may mislead me: I am too presumptuous to mention my opinion at all. 



Sea. (taking his hand with warmth.) 
O no! I like you the better for it! to be warmly sanguine is characteristic and graceful in youth; and perhaps this propensity does not more often mislead it than the timorous caution of age.---You mention'd a friend to whom I might resign my pretensions to this office? 


Sir C. 
I did, Sir Anthony; but I now feel an embarrassment.---I'm sure it would never have enter'd into my imagination to think of it. But will you be kind enough to take a turn with me in the garden? there are some things that must be explain'd to you at length, lest you should at all misconceive what I am going to propose to you. 

                                         (Exeunt. 


[Page 439 ] 


SCENE II. 

The servants' hall; and Robert discovered pulling some clothes out of a bag, and laughing to himself as he looks at them. Enter cookmaid . 



Cook. 
Are you here, Robert? 


Rob. 
Yes, beef-drippings; what do you want? 


Cook. 
It is ghost-time, don't you know? and your night for it too. 


Rob. 
Indeed! 


Cook. 
Ay, indeed! I groan'd last night, and Gardener the night before; so e'en take your own turn when it comes to you: you was the first contriver of the plot. 


Rob. 
Why don't you see me preparing, hussy? I'm going to dress myself up this very night for the grand contasterfy, as a learned person would call it. 



Cook. (clapping her hands.) 
O griskins and gravy, but that be delightful! Are you to appear to her to-night? 


Rob. 
Yes, wench; for my master is in town, and is not expected back before to-morrow. 
(Holding out the clothes.) 
How do you like this black robe? Has it not a smack of the devil in it? 


Cook. 
Black! I thought you were to have been all in white, like my late lady, and to have threaten'd her for being so unkind to the children. 


Rob. 
So I intended, Deborah; but I don't know [25]  how, a qualm came across my heart, and would 

[Page 440 ] 

not let me make a mockery and a semblance of my dear mistress; so we'll just make the devil do, my fat Deborah; he'll serve our turn well enough. 


Cook. 
Yes; he serves many a turn, if all that is said of him be true. 


Rob. 
How do you like that black hood with the horns to it? it is all my own contrivance. 


Cook. 
O it will do hugeously! 


Rob. 
And pray mix a little sooty grease for my face, cooky; and let me have some brick-dust to make a red staring ring round my eyes. 


Cook. 
That I will in a trice! But where is your tail, master devil? Will the jack-chain be of any use to you? 


Rob. 
No, no! let her once have a good look of my horns and my red staring eyes, and I warrant you she'll never miss my tail. 


Cook. 
Good success to you! 


Rob. 
I don't doubt of success; for my lady has lived a great part of her life in an old castle in the North, and has as good a notion of a ghost or a goblin as most folks. 


Cook. 
He, he, he! Some folks will be warm enough to-night without frying cutlets. And bless [50]  you, man! if Mrs. Pry should come in your way, give her a claw for my sake. 


Rob. 
O never doubt that, hussy!---And here, in good time, comes Sharp to settle his part of the business; for you know we are to give his master a claw too, as well as Mrs. Pry. 


[Page 441 ] 

(Enter Sharp .) 



Cook. 
Come away, Sharp; which of us all is to visit your master's chamber to night in the shape of the lady that he jilted, as you told us of, because her rich uncle chose to marry whilst their wedding clothes were a-making, and who took it so much to heart, poor thing! that she died soon after of the small-pox? I should not much care to do it myself. 


Sharp. 
No, cooky, we have a better plan than that! 


Cook. 
What is it, man? 


Sharp. 
Tho' he laughs at Miss Seabright as a girl from the nursery, he has taken a strong desire to know whether she likes him or not; and, above all, what fortune she is to have: now I have promised to set Pry a talking to her lady about this, when she puts her to bed to-night, and to place him snugly in the adjoining chamber where he may hear every word that they say. 


Rob. 
[75]  You have told him there is no danger of being discover'd, as that room is always kept lock'd, and that you have stolen the key of it? 


Sharp. 
You may be sure of that. 


Rob. 
Then you may be sure the devil won't fail to take that chamber on his way from Lady Sarah's, and pay his respects to him in passing. Come, come! let us all set about it! I'll dress in my own garret. Take some of those things in your hand. 

                                         (Giving cook some of the clothes to carry, and taking the rest himself.) 

                                         (Exeunt. 


[Page 442 ] 


SCENE III. 

Lady Sarah 's bed-room, almost dark, with a feeble light thrown across the floor, as from a bad fire. Enter Sir Crafty Supplecoat and Sharp , stealing softly on their tiptoes. 



Sir C. 
Hist, hist! which is the door, Sharp? 


Sharp. 
Never fear, Sir; come this way. 
(opening the door of an adjoining room.) 
Go in, Sir, and fear nothing. But you must sit in the dark, and not be impatient: Pry wont fail to pump her lady, and you'll hear every word that is said. 

                                         (putting Sir Crafty into the room, and pretending to lock the door upon him, then exit laughing to himself as he goes out.) 

                                         (Enter Lady Sarah , and Pry carrying lights, by the same door by which Sharp went out, allowing him time to get out of the way without meeting him. 



Pry. (setting down the lights.) 
Well, I wish this night were well over, for I had such strange dreams last night. 


Lady S. 
Don't trouble me with your dreams now. Have you put all my muslin things into the press, and screw'd them well down? When the creases are taken out of them, they will do perfectly well to wear another day. 


Pry. 
To be sure, my Lady; but for that old petticoat, if I do but touch it, it comes to pieces; it grieves me to see your Ladyship dragging it about 

[Page 443 ] 

like a cobweb that the flies have been thro'; it would tear up into such pretty handkerchiefs! 


Lady S. 
Will it? as large as those I commonly wear? 


Pry. 
O no! I don't mean such handkerchiefs as you would wear, my Lady, but just--- 


Lady S. 
Don't tease me now.---Have you heard [25]  any of those noises to-night? 

                                         (seating herself in a chair near the front of the stage.) 


Pry. 
La no! my Lady; did you hear any thing? 


Lady S. 
No, nothing at all: why do you look so frighten'd? 


Pry. 
I'm sure the very thoughts of it has made my teeth to chatter like a spoon in an empty dish. I never heard of such things being heard in any house, except the old Castle of Allcrest, just before the Earl, your grandfather, died. Mercy on us! there was no such noises heard in our village. 


Lady S. 
Apparitions seldom visit people of low condition, Pry. 


Pry. 
God be praised for it! I hope this here will be of the same way of thinking. I would not be a great lady and have ghosts grunting at my bed side for the whole universal world. If you please, my Lady, I should like to go up to Susan as soon as may be, pardon my boldness, for she is as frighten'd as I am; and I may chance to meet something in the stairs, if I am much later; and I know very well, my Lady, you're not afraid. 


Lady S. 
No, I'm not afraid, but I don't know how---I have a little of I don't know what, that has 

[Page 444 ] 

come upon me.---You had better sleep on the couch by my bed to-night; I may want my drops [50]  in the night time.---What o'clock is it? 



Pry. (looking at a watch.) 
Mercy on us! it's just the very time when it begins.---What's that? 

                                         (alarmed.) 


Lady S. 
Nothing: I heard nothing. 
(a long pause; then a deep groan is heard from the bottom of the stage.) 
Come, come! stand closer to me Pry. 
(taking hold of Pry. ) 
It had a strange, hollow, unnatural sound. 


Pry. 
Yes; just like a body speaking out of a coffin. 

                                         (A pause, and then a second groan is heard, louder than the first.) 


Lady S. 
Stand closer still, I beseech you: that was horrible! 
(putting out her hand, trembling.) 
Whe---whe---where is the bell-rope? 


Pry. 
O la! you know well enough it hangs in the other end of the room. 


Lady S. 
Go pull it then: pull it violently. 
( Pry hesitates, and seems very unwilling to go.) 
Go, I say! 

                                         ( Pry goes; and as she is half way across the room, another groan, followed by a terrible howl, is heard, and she runs back again to Lady Sarah .) 


Lady S. 
O go and do it! for heaven's sake! for God's sake! for mercy's sake do it! 

                                         ( Pry then goes sidling across the floor, looking on every side with terror and suspicion, till she gets to the bell rope which hangs by the head of the 

[Page 445 ] 

bed and near the door of the room; when, putting out her hand to pull it, Robert , dressed like the devil, rises from behind a great chair close to the bed. Pry screams and runs out of the door, whilst he gives her a claw in the passing, and then advances towards the front of the stage to Lady Sarah .) 



Lady S. (shrinking back as he advances.) 
O come no nearer, whatever thou be, thou black and horrible sight! 
(Devil still advances.) 
O come no nearer! in the holy name of--- 


Devil. 
Baw! 

                                         (giving a great howl, and still advancing.) 


Lady S. 
In the blessed name of--- 


Devil. 
Baw! 

                                         (with another howl, and coming very near her.) 



Lady S. (falling upon her knees, and clasping her hands together.) 
[75]  O, as thou art awful, be merciful! O touch me not, for I am a miserable sinner! 


Devil. 
Yea thou art---yea thou art---yea thou art, and thou shalt smart. Ill deeds thou dost, and thou shalt roast. 

                                         (holding his great claw over her.) 



Lady. S. (contracting all her body together, and sinking down upon the floor.) 
O, as thou art horrible, be merciful! What shall I do? what shall I do? 


Devil. 
Be kind to thy husband's children, or I will tear--- 


Lady S. 
O yes, yes! 


Devil. 
Give them good victuals, and good education, and good clothing, or I will tear thee--- 


Lady S. 
O yes, yes! 


[Page 446 ] 



Devil. 
And give no more good things to Tony than the rest, or I will--- 
(starting back upon hearing a loud knocking at the street-door.) 
What's that? 



Lady S. (raising her head, and seeing him farther off.) 
No more good things to Tony than the rest! It was no devil that spoke those words, I'm sure. 

                                         (taking courage, and getting up.) 



Devil. (aside, after moving farther off and listening.) 
Faith I'll turn and give her a claw yet! I shall never have another opportunity. 

                                         (approaching her again.) 


Lady S. 
Get along! I know you well enough: you are no devil, but a rascally knave. 

                                         (setting herself in a posture of defence, when a noise is heard without, and he, taking alarm, makes a hasty exit into the adjoining chamber.) 
(Enter Seabright , and Pry coming fearfully after him.) 



Sea. 
Where is this devil that Pry has been telling me of? 



Lady S. (pointing to the adjoining room.) 
Follow him [100]  my dear Sir Anthony! Follow after the rascal. 

                                         (Exit Seabright into the adjoining room.) 



Lady S. (calling to him.) 
Be sure you don't let him escape.---Have you caught him yet? 



Sea. (within) 
Yes, I've caught him. 


Lady S. 
Give him a good beating then; don't spare him! he's a good brawny devil! O don't spare him! 

(A great scuffle is heard within, and Sea. calls to Lady S .) 
I'm dealing with him roughly enough, if that will satisfy you. 
(he then calls out as if speaking to the 

[Page 447 ] 

Devil .) 
And take that, and that, and that too, you diabolical rascal! You must have midnight frolicks in my house, must you? 

(Enter Sophia alarmed.) 



Sophia. 
What is all this? did I not hear my father's voice? 



Lady S. (looking suspiciously at her.) 
Yes, you know nothing of the matter, innocent lamb! 


Pry. 
I hope my master will give him a sound beating, for I know well enough it is that knave Robert; I could smell the very stink of his tobacco as he claw'd me in the passing. 


Lady S. 
Drag him to the light, Sir Anthony, let us see him stript of his devil's skin. Ha! here he comes. 

                                         (Enter Seabright dragging in Sir Crafty Supplecoat , who is pulled along very unwillingly, and hiding his face with his arm.) 


Pry. 
Why that an't like him neither. Come, [125]  come! take down your arm, and let us see who you are. 

                                         (pulling down his arm, and discovering his face.) 



All. (exclaiming.) 
Sir Crafty Supplecoat! 



Soph. (clapping her hands.) 
O I'm glad of that! I'm so glad that it is only Sir Crafty! I should have been grieved indeed if it had been poor Robert. And so it is you Sir Crafty! ha, ha, ha, ha! 

                                         (All join her in laughing heartily, whilst Robert , having pulled off his devil's dress, enters accompanied by Sharp and some of the other servants, and joins also in the laugh.) 


[Page 448 ] 




Lady S. (going up to Sir Crafty with great indignation.) 
And so, Sir Crafty Supplecoat, it is to your midnight mummery I am indebted for the stern and solemn threatenings I have received! I have been visited I find by a devil of consequence. Your earnest zeal for my reformation is, indeed, very flattering. 


Sea. 
Sir Crafty, mean and despicable as you must appear to me, I have too much respect for your situation in life to expose you any longer to this open humiliation and disgrace: Come with me to my dressing room. 


Sir C. 
I protest to you Sir Anthony, and to Lady Sarah, and to all the world if they were here present, that I am in no wise concern'd in what you suspect me of. 


Lady S. 
O certainly you protest, Sir Crafty! but do you think that will pass upon me? Have I not known you since you were a boy but so high, [150]  with all your little, artful, wriggling, under-hand ways of getting your play fellows' toys from them, which I always despised and contemned? To be sure, you will protest any thing, and in the politest manner too: you will send a message to Sir Anthony to-morrow morning, I make no doubt, to enquire how he does; and to hope that his fists are not too much fatigued with their last night's exertions. 

                                         (all the servants laugh again.) 


Sea. 
Come, come, this is too bad! Retire with me, Sir Crafty; you can say nothing for yourself at 

[Page 449 ] 

this moment. I am sorry I have rib-roasted you so unmercifully; can you walk? 



Sir C. (very shortly.) 
Yes, yes. 


Rob. 
O we'll help his honour. 

                                         (going up with Sharp , very provokingly, to assist him.) 


Sir C. 
Keep off, scoundrels! you are at the bottom of all this. 

                                         (Exeunt Seabright leading out Sir Crafty in a very rueful plight, followed by Lady Sarah and Sophia , and the servants, endeavouring to stifle their laughter.) 

SCENE IV. 

Seabright's library. A great noise and confusion of voices is heard without. 




Seabright. (speaking without.) 
Torment me no more with these things! I will hear no more complaints, and no more explanations! let me have peace, I beseech you, in mine own house, for one half hour at least. 
(He enters much disturb'd, shutting the door violently behind him, and pacing up and down the room, sometimes muttering to himself, and sometimes speaking aloud.) 
What! is there no getting on in this upward path of honour, unless we tear our way through all these briars and nettles?---Contention and misery at home! is this the price we pay for honour and distinction in the world? Would no honours take root on my untoward soil, till I had grubb'd up every sprig and shoot of comfort to make room for them? It were better to be a panniered jack-ass, and pick up my scanty provender 

[Page 450 ] 

from the ditch, than be a garter'd peer in such a home as this.---I had once a home! 
(beating his heel rapidly upon the floor.) 
---Well, well, well! I have push'd my bark from the shore, and I must take wind and tide as they set. 
(Enter Servant .) 

Who comes to disturb me now? 


Ser. 
A packet, please your honour, from Mr. Plausible. 



Sea. (eagerly.) 
Ha! give it me. 
(Exit Ser. ) 
Yes, it is the plan. 
(tearing off the cover.) 
I hold in my [25]  hand perhaps, that which shall put every domestic arrangement on such an ample footing, as must extinguish these petty broils. 
(a pause, and then his countenance lightening up eagerly.) 
Ah, do I indeed grasp in this handful of paper the embryo of my future fortune? In faith I could almost believe that I do! Let me go to my closet and examine it. 

                                         (Exit. 

SCENE V. 

A room in the inn. Enter Seabright and Landlady speaking as they enter. 



Sea. 
So, Mr. Plausible is not yet come? 


Land. 
No, your honour, not as I know of. There is a dark-looking, lank gentleman in the cow-yard, just now, asking our Bridget how many pounds of butter may be made out of one cow's milk in a year, and such like, and setting all that she says down in his pocket book. He, he, he! poor thing, she scarcely knows a cow from a sheep, 

[Page 451 ] 

by reason that she is but a poor pea-picking girl from St. Giles's, that has scarcely been a month in the country; howsomever, he gets wonderfully on with his information. 


Sea. 
Ay, that is him: he has a talent for picking up information upon every subject, and from every body: pray let him know I am here. 
(Exit Land .) 
--- 
(After musing a little while.) 
Ten thousand a-year! and the risk of failing but a mere trifle, not to be taken into the calculation. And his reasons are good, obvious, and convincing. But let me be moderate now: let me suppose that it only brings me in six thousand a-year; even that will entitle me to a peerage. 

(Enter Plausible .) 



Plau. 
I have a request to make to you, Sir Anthony? 


Sea. 
What is that, my dear Plausible? 


Plau. 
[25]  When you purchase the large estate in Shropshire, will you let me have an easy lease of a good pasture farm or two upon it? It will be a country retirement for me; and I find on calculation that a hundred milk-cows, well fed and well managed, will bring in no contemptible revenue. 



Sea. (smiling.) 
You talk of this estate with great confidence, Plausible. 


Plau. 
Nay, I am only certain of putting the money to buy it into your pocket; you will purchase it or not, as you please. 


Sea. 
I begin, indeed, to think favourably of your scheme, and I appointed you to meet me here, 

[Page 452 ] 

that we might not he interrupted by Lady Sarah. Women you know are timorous, and have no idea of encreasing a fortune except by saving. We shall look over your calculations together. If salt is raised but one penny in the pound, how many thousands do I put in my pocket? 


Plau. 
This paper will inform you exactly. And you see I have put but one penny upon the pound; for salt being a necessary of life, greatly to increase its price would be hard and unfeeling; it would make you unpopular in the country, and in the end create a resistance detrimental to its own ends. [50]  I am for moderate and sure gains. 



Sea. (taking the paper.) 
I esteem you for it; my ideas coincide with yours most perfectly in this particular: and the paper also in which you have drawn out your plan for buying up the rock-salt, I should be glad to look over that. 


Plau. 
Here it is in my pocket. 

(Enter Beaumont and William Beaumont .) 




Sea. (angrily.) 
Who comes now? O it is you, Beaumont. We are busy; I shall come to you by-and-bye, but at present I cannot be interrupted. 


Bea. 
I must speak with you, my friend. 


Sea. 
Not at present---you see I am engaged. 



Bea. (beckoning him.) 
But one word in your ear, I beseech you. 


Sea. 
Yes, by-and-bye; at present I am busy with affairs of importance. 


[Page 453 ] 



Bea. 
By-and-bye will, perhaps, be too late; I must speak with you immediately. 

                                         (beckoning him again.) 



Sea. (impatiently.) 
I cannot speak with you just now, Beaumont, and I will not. 


Bea. 
No, no! you will. If there be any love of God or any love of man in your heart, you will speak with me. 



Sea. (softened.) 
Well then. 
(goes to Beaumont , who whispers in his ear and endeavours to draw him away.) 
No, I won't go with you, Beaumont, to be [75]  retarded and cross'd with your fears and suspicions: Speak out boldly, and Mr. Plausible will answer for himself. 
(smiling to Plau. ) 
I believe we must explain our plan to this good friend of mine, for he thinks you are going to ruin me, and he is miserably afraid of projectors; ha, ha, ha! 



Plau. (smiling placidly.) 
I esteem him for the interest he takes in his friend, and I don't condemn his suspicions: there are so many absurd schemes in the world, that it is prudent to be distrustful; but I will shew him the firm ground on which we rest, and he will be satisfied. Do me the honour, my dear Sir, to sit down by me, and I'll explain it to you. 

                                         (to Beau. ) 


Bea. 
Pray don't take that trouble, Mr. Plausible: I have no information for enabling me to judge of it: my mind has been little exercised in regard to the money affairs of the world. But 

[Page 454 ] 

though I am not a man of the world, I have one or two things to say to my friend that I wish him to attend to. 



Sea. (smiling rather contemptuously.) 
Well, what are they Beaumont? you are, indeed, not a man of the world. 


Bea. 
Every man who risks his fortune in any [100]  scheme, believes he has good grounds to rest upon: they are such as appear feasible to him. 


Sea. 
Feasible! ours is certain. 



Bea. (shaking his head.) 
A man who is anxious to get rich is apt to let his judgment be imposed upon, and forgets how many have fail'd in the same track before him. 


Sea. 
I wish those who are apt to give advice, would take the same thing into their consideration. 


Bea. 
Nay, my friend, there is a social influence which we all have, even the meanest of us, over one another, and there is more advice taken in the world than you are aware of. But had every adviser from the beginning of time fail'd before me, I will never believe that he who pleads to a father in behalf of his own children will speak without effect. Hear me then; let him who stands alone, run every risk to aggrandize himself, but let a father---O let the father of a family consider! 


Plau. 
You forget, my good Sir, that the father of a family has a higher motive than any other man to aggrandize himself. 


[Page 455 ] 




Sea. (vehemently.) 
Rather than not place my children in the situation I desire for them, I would have no children at all. 



Bea. (with warmth.) 
[125]  What, will you say of creatures passing onward to the noblest destination, you had rather they had never been, unless they can gather up so much dust and trash on their way? You think yourself an ambitious parent---O I would be for them a thousand times more ambitious than thou art. 


Sea. 
Yes, you will shape your son's fortune out of the clouds, I make no doubt. 

                                         (smiling contemptuously.) 



Will. B. (who has modestly kept behind, now coming forward with spirit.) 
Wherever my fortune may be shaped for me, to be the honest, well principled son of an honest, and good father, is a distinction I would not give up for all that you, and men like you, are scrambling for. 
(turning to Beau. ) 
Come away, father; they but mock at what you say. 


Bea. 
Let him mock if he will, but let him hear me. 


Plau. 
He will hear your advice with great pleasure from the pulpit, Mr. Beaumont. 


Will. B. 
It would have been happy for the unfortunate men who have listened to yours, Mr. Plausible, if they had received it from the same place. 
(pulling Beaumont away.) 
Come away, father, you but waste words upon them. 


[Page 456 ] 



Bea. 
[150]  Nay, I would yet try if there is not some heart in him to be moved. 


Sea. 
My dear Beaumont, you are a very good man, but you know nothing of the matter. 



Will. B. (pulling away his father.) 
Leave them, leave them, Sir! Good man, as he contemptuously calls you, you are also wise enough for me: and I would not exchange fathers with the proudest young lord in the kingdom. 

                                         (Exeunt Beau. and Will. B. Will. putting his father's arm proudly under his, and walking off with spirit.) 


Plau. 
We are obliged to that young dog, however, for taking him away. 


Sea. 
Yes; but we will go to another room, for he may return again. 

                                         (Exeunt. 
END OF THE FOURTH ACT.


[Page 457 ] 


ACT V. 

SCENE I. 

Seabright 's library. He is discovered sitting by a table fast asleep, on which are scattered letters and papers. Enter Pry softly behind on her tiptoes, and making a long neck to see what he is about. 




Pry. (shaking her head piteously.) 
Poor man! poor man! he can't sleep in his bed o'nights, and yet he has never committed any wicked crimes, that I ever heard of. 



Sea. (angrily, after speaking inarticulately to himself in his sleep.) 
You don't know my name! 
(muttering again inarticulately.) 
The name of Lord Sea-bright. 
(muttering again, whilst Pry slips still nearer to him, listening with a face of great curiosity.) 
I can't walk in my robes any longer.---See how the crowd stares at me; ha, ha, ha! 
(laughing uncouthly, and Pry , drawing still nearer him, comes against a chair on her way, the noise of which wakes him, and she retires precipitately.) 
What's that? 
(rubbing his eyes and looking round.) 
It has been some noise in my dream. Ah! would it had been a reality!---What a busy, prosperous, animating world I have been in for these last two hours. 
(looking at his watch.) 
Ha! I have 

[Page 458 ] 

slept only a quarter of an hour; and I have enjoyed as many honours in that short term as would enrich my life-time.---Shall they indeed enrich it?---Wise men, in former ages, consider'd the visions of our sleep as faintly sketching out what is to happen, like trees and castles seen thro' the morning mist, before the brightening sun gives to them the distinct clearness of reality. 
(smiling animatedly.) 
In faith I could almost believe it! There is that invigorating [25]  confidence within me which says I shall not stop short at these paltry attainments---A baronet! every body now is a baronet.---My soul disdains the thought! 

                                         (gives his chair a kick, and overturning it with a great noise,) 
(Enter Pry alarmed.) 



Pry. 
O la, Sir! what is the matter? 


Sea. 
What, are you up Pry? Why are you out of bed so late? 


Pry. 
Making your coffee, Sir. 


Sea. 
Did not I tell you to leave it on the lamp, and go to bed? 


Pry. 
Yes; but I thought it would keep warmer, some how, if I sat by it myself. 



Sea. (aside.) 
Great fool! 
(aloud.) 
Let me have some of it then; my head will be clearer afterwards for writing. 

                                         (Exit. 



Pry. (shaking her head, and looking after him as he goes out.) 
Poor man! he would have every body to go to bed but himself. What has he got here now? 
(looking at the papers on the table.) 
Copies of letters to my Lord B---, and notes for a speech on the 

[Page 459 ] 

salt duties; and calculations.---O lud, lud! What a power of trouble he does give himself! Poor man! poor man! 
(Exit in a hurry, calling out as she goes.) 
I just stay'd behind, Sir, to stir the fire for you. 

SCENE II. 

A room in the inn. Enter Mrs. Beaumont and Landlady , by different sides. 



Land. 
La, madam! here be the great Lord, Lady Sarah Seabright's brother, who wants to see you. 


Mrs. B. 
Wants to see me? how comes this great condescension? 


Land. 
I reckon, madam, that some misfortune has befallen him, and that makes some folks wonderfully well bred. I was just standing at the door, a few minutes ago, and thinking, to be sure, nothing at all of the matter, when who should I see drive past but my Lord, just turning the corner as he used to do to Sir Anthony's gate. Well, I thinks no more of the matter, when in a trice by comes that saucy-looking gentleman of his, that turns up his nose at my ale, and puts a letter into his lord's hand; upon which, after he had read it, he desired his postillions to turn round and set him down here. I'm as sure as I am a living woman that something has happen'd, for he came into the house with a face as white as my apron. 


Mrs. B. 
And wants to see me? 


Land. 
Yes, madam; he ask'd first of all for Mr. Beaumont, and finding he was walk'd out, he ask'd next for you. 


[Page 460 ] 



Mrs. B. 
[25]  But how did he know we were here? 


Land. 
La, madam! he saw your carriage in the yard, and moreover your man told him that his master and mistress had stopp'd here, on their way to Yorkshire, to see Sir Anthony's children. But here he comes, madam. Save us all! how proud and how vexed he looks! 

                                         (Exit. 
(Enter Lord Allcrest .) 



Lord A. 
Madam, I am sorry to find Mr. Beaumont is gone out: I had something of importance to communicate to him, but I believe it will be nearly the same thing if I impart it to you. I---I--- 
(seems embarrassed.) 
---it is an unfortunate affair. As to myself, I have little to do with it; but it is right that the near relations of Sir Anthony Seabright should know, that his salt scheme has entirely fail'd, and he is involved in utter ruin; they can communicate the dreadful tidings to him more properly than I can. 


Mrs. B. 
We are obliged to you, my Lord; it is a piece of intelligence we have every day expected to hear, but which does not certainly concern us more nearly than yourself, as I, who am Sir Anthony's connexion, stand exactly in the same degree of relation to him with your Lordship. 


Lord A. 
Yes; my sister, indeed, would gratify [50]  very foolishly a foolish inclination---but it is a recent thing, scarcely to be consider'd as a---a--- a---he had many children by your sister, and lived with her many years. 


[Page 461 ] 




Mrs. B. (smiling with great contempt.) 
I don't know, indeed, at what time, from the date of a man's marriage, he is entitled to claim affinity with his wife's relations: perhaps it varies with occurrences, and misfortunes certainly have no tendency to shorten it. 


Lord A. 
Madam, let me have the honour to inform you, that there is no term in which the chief of a noble and ancient family can be contaminated by the inferior alliances of those individuals who belong to his family: such things are consider'd as mere adventitious circumstances. 


Mrs. B. 
You teach me, my Lord, to make very nice distinctions; and therefore, whilst I pay all respect to you as the representative of a noble family, you must likewise permit me to express for you, as an individual, sentiments of a very opposite nature. 


Lord A. 
Good breeding, madam, will not permit me to return such an answer as you deserve; and therefore I will no longer intrude on your time. 


Mrs. B. 
[75]  A better excuse, perhaps, might be found; but any one will be perfectly acceptable that procures me the pleasure of wishing your Lordship good morning. 

                                         (As Lord Allcrest is about to go out, enter Beaumont and Morgan , and prevent him.) 


Bea. 
I am sorry, my Lord, I was not in the way when you did me the honour to enquire for me. 



Lord A. (passing him abruptly with a slight bow.) 
Good morning, Sir; good morning. 


[Page 462 ] 




Bea. (going after him.) 
You are not going to leave me thus, my Lord, angry and disturb'd as you appear to be? I cannot suffer any body, man, woman, or child, to leave me offended, if it be possible for me to part with them on more amicable terms. I flatter myself it is possible to do so on the present occasion; I am sure, I am confident of it, if you will do me the honour to explain in what way I can be useful to you. 


Lord A. 
I came here, Sir, upon no concerns of my own; and the conversation I have had the honour to hold with this Lady, makes any explanation of the business that brought me unnecessary. 


Bea. 
But she is angry too, I perceive, and I will have no explanation from her. I know already the unfortunate affairs of poor Seabright; and I can explain to myself the intention of your Lordship's visit: you must have the goodness to stay and hear [100]  if I explain it right. 
(taking him by the coat and preventing him from going.) 
Nay, nay, my Lord! the spirit of charity and of peace-making makes a well-meaning man very bold,---you shall stay. 



Lord A. (relenting, and turning back.) 
I do believe, Mr. Beaumont, that you are a very good man, and as such I respect you; but since you already know the misfortune of Sir Anthony Seabright, and will, from the dictates of your own good heart, open the matter to him in the best manner possible, my business with you is anticipated. 


[Page 463 ] 



Mrs. B. 
Not, I believe, entirely, my Lord; for he knows nothing at all, as yet, of those nice distinctions between individual and family relationship, which may be necessary to prevent him from forming any unreasonable expectations from a noble brother-in-law. I presume your Lordship means to hurry back to town again, without seeing Sir Anthony. 


Bea. 
Hold your tongue, Susan; your spirit is less mild than it ought to be, considering the warm good heart it belongs to. It is not so: his lordship did not intend returning to town without seeing his distress'd friend; you are wrong in the very outset of your account. Is she not, my Lord? 



Lord A. (confused and hesitating.) 
[125]  If my seeing him could be of any real service, I should never--- I could not certainly have thought of returning without seeing him.---But he has never attended to my opinions: my advice has been disregarded--- and then, his damn'd vanity: he refused an office the other day, which I would have procured for him, that would have been a competency for life--- it makes me mad to think of it. 


Bea. 
Ah, my Lord! he is in that state in which a man's errours should be remember'd only by himself: he is in adversity. 


Lord A. 
He has thought only of himself, I'm sure. 


Bea. 
His connexion with your sister has, indeed, been unlucky; and I can, in some degree, sympathize with your resentment. 


[Page 464 ] 



Lord A. 
You mistake me, Sir; his connexion with my sister is of no consequence to me; and I shall take care that it shall be of as little to her as possible, for I will make her independent of him: but children!---risking every thing on one single stake, with a family of children!---I am provoked beyond all measure when I think of this. 



Mrs. B. (bridling up.) 
His children, my Lord--- 


Bea. 
[150]  Now pray, my dear, hold your tongue, if it be possible! We are weak, passionate creatures, why should we rub and fret one another thus? 
(to Lord A. ) 
I praise you much, my Lord, for the interest you take in the children; but here is a good man 
(pointing to Morgan .) 
who will--- 


Mor. 
Stop, stop, my good friend, and don't now lead me into any discussion upon this subject. I am disturb'd, and uncomfortable, and unequal to it. Take his Lordship by himself; and say to him what you please for me. 
(to Mrs. B. ) 
Come with me, niece. 

                                         (Exeunt Mor. and Mrs. B. 


Bea. 
Let me have the pleasure of attending your Lordship into the fields, where we can take a short turn or two, and speak of this subject at length: I see strangers arrived; and it is noisy here. 


Lord A. 
Most willingly. 

                                         (Exeunt. 


[Page 465 ] 


SCENE III. 

Seabright 's house. Enter Seabright , followed by Sophia , the eldest boy , and the little girl . 



Soph. 
Indeed, papa, you are in such good humour this morning we can't help following you. I hope we are not troublesome; if we are, I'll take the children away. 


Sea. 
No, my good children, you are not troublesome; you shan't go away. 

                                         (The children hang on his coat, and look up in his face much pleased.) 


Soph. 
They are so glad to hang upon you again, papa; and you are so good humour'd this morning! 


Sea. 
I finish'd my papers last night; and I have had some pleasant dreams too.---This is a chearful, enlivening morning: every thing is in bright sunshine around us: it is like a day that wears good fortune on its face:---and, perhaps, it does. 


Soph. 
I hope it does: and now that you seem so happy, papa, I would fain plead to you in behalf of a poor good man, who is not very happy at present. 


Sea. 
And who is that? 


Soph. 
Ah, you know very well; it is poor Robert. I know it was very wrong in him to frighten Lady Sarah; but he meant it for our good, and he will break his heart if he is not allow'd to be with us again. 


[Page 466 ] 



Sea. 
Say no more of this at present, Sophia; and, [25]  perhaps, by-and-bye, he may return to us again as your own servant. 


Soph. 
Ha! 
(surprised.) 


Sea. 
Yes, my sweet girl; I will be very liberal to you and to all my children: I will make a good amends to you for all that is past. 
(turning to the boy.) 
And you, my good boy, I must think of you by-and-bye. Thou art become a stout boy, George: let me look at thy face. 
(lifting up his hair from his forehead.) 
Ay, it is a comely face enough: it will make a very good countenance for an admiral, or a general, or even for the woolsack, if thine inclinations should lead thee that way. Let me feel thy weight too, young rogue. 
(taking him up in his arms.) 
Ah! would now that I could but know the rank and eminence of the future man I hold in these arms! 


Soph. 
My dear Sir, you are so good to us, and so good humoured this morning, I could wager those letters by the post have brought you pleasant news. 


Sea. 
Letters by the post! I have received none. 


Soph. 
Then you have not read them yet. You slept so much longer than usual this morning, that you were not up when they came, and they were [50]  put on the table in the next room. 

                                         (pointing off the stage.) 


Sea. 
Let me see them, then; if they bring me any good news they are welcome. 

                                         (Exit with a light active step.) 


[Page 467 ] 



Soph. 
Now, children, did not I tell you yesterday that papa would love us again; and you see he has begun to do it already. 


Boy. 
And so he does, Sophy; and I'm sorry I spoke so naughtily of him, for my heart jumps so when he loves me! 
(looking off the stage.) 
But see! what is he about now, beating his forehead and walking up and down so strangely? 


Soph. 
O dear! something is the matter. 

                                         (Exit, alarmed.) 



Boy. (to little girl.) 
Now don't ask me for those marbles at present, Emma; I can't find them, I don't know where they are. 
(looking off the stage again.) 
O how terrible he looks! 

                                         (Re-enter Seabright , with an open letter in his hand, beating his head with his clench'd hands, and tossing about his arm distractedly, followed by Sophia , who seems frightened at him, and yet wishing to sooth him. A long pause, in which he paces up and down the stage followed by Sophia , whilst the children run into a corner, frightened, and stare at him.) 



Soph. (after attempting in vain several times to speak.) 
My father! my dear, dear father! 
(he still paces up and down without heeding her.) 
O if you would but speak two words, and tell what is the matter with you, my dear, dear Sir! 


Sea. 
I am ruined, and deceived, and undone! I am a bankrupt and a beggar!---I have made beggars of you all! 


[Page 468 ] 



Soph. 
O no, father! that won't be! for God's sake don't take on so violently! 



Sea. (still pacing up and down, followed by Soph. ) 
[75]  I am a bankrupt and a beggar!---disgrace, and ridicule, and contempt!---Ideot, ideot, ideot! O worse than ideot! 


Soph. 
Dear father! 

                                         (The children run and take hold of Sophia , as she follows him.) 


Sea. 
Come not near me---come not near me, children---I have made beggars of you all! 


Soph. 
But we will come near you, my dear father, and love you and bless you too, whatever you have done. Ay, and if we are beggars, we will beg with you, and beg for you cheerfully. 


Sea. 
Oh, oh, oh! This is more than I can bear! 

                                         (Throws himself into a chair, quite overcome, whilst the children stand gazing on him, and Sophia hangs over him affectionately.) 
(Enter Lady Sarah .) 



Lady S. 
What are you doing here, children?--- What is all this for?---What is the matter with you, Sir Anthony?---No answer at all!---What letter is this? 
(picks up the letter which Seabright had dropt in his agitation, and reads it; then breaking out violently.) 
O, I told you it would come to this!--- I counsel'd you---I warn'd you---I beseech'd you. O Sir Anthony! Sir Anthony! what devil tempted you to such madness as this? 


Soph. 
Oh, madam, do not upbraid him! See how he is! 


[Page 469 ] 



Lady S. 
I see how it is well enough: the devil, the devil of ambition has tempted him--- 
(going nearer him with great vehemence.) 
Did not I tell you that with prudence, and management, and [100]  economy, we should in the end amass a good fortune? but you must be in such a hurry to get rich! ---O it would get the better of a saint's spirit to think how I have saved, and regulated, and laid down rules for my houshold, and that it should all come to this!---To have watched, and toiled, and fretted as I have done, and all to no purpose!---If I did not begrudge the very food that was consumed in the family!---If I did not try all manner of receipts that the wife of the meanest citizen would scarcely have thought of!---If I did not go a bargain hunting thro' every shop in London, and purchase damaged muslins even for my own wearing! ---It is very hard---it is very hard indeed! 
(bursting into tears.) 
O it is enough to turn a woman's brains! 



Sea. (starting up in a rage.) 
By heavens, madam, it is enough to turn a man's brains to think, that, in addition to the ruin I have brought upon myself and my children, I have taken to my bosom---I have set over their innocent heads, a hard-hearted, narrow, avaricious woman, whose meanness makes me contemptible, whose person and character I despise!---This, madam, the spirit of ambition, which you talk of, has tempted me to do, and [125]  for this, more than all his other malice, I will curse him! 


[Page 470 ] 




Soph. (endeavouring to sooth him.) 
Pray be not so violent with her! she does not consider what she says---she did not intend to hurt you. 


Lady S. 
Sir Anthony Seabright, you are a base man and a deceiver: my brother shall know how you have used me: he has made you a Member of Parliament and a Baronet. 


Sea. 
Yes, and a contemptible fool, and a miserable wretch into the bargain. But no, no, no! I have made myself so; I deserve my punishment.--- 
                                         (Enter Lord Allcrest, Beaumont, Morgan, Mrs. B. and William B. ) 
And here are more of my advisers and beseechers come to visit me: advance, advance, good friends! you are come to look upon a ruined man, and you are gratified. 



Bea. (going up to him affectionately.) 
No, my dear Seabright; in a very different spirit are we come: we come to sympathize with you, and to console you. 


Sea. 
I hate sympathy, and I hate consolation! You are come, I suppose, to sympathize with me too, my Lord, and to put me in mind of the damn'd place I have given up to that knave Sir Crafty Supplecoat. 


Lord A. 
[150]  No, Sir Anthony, I scorn to upbraid, but I pretend neither to sympathize with you nor to console you: I come to rescue my sister from a situation unworthy a daughter of the house of Allcrest, and she shall go home with me. 


[Page 471 ] 



Sea. 
Nay, by the sincerity of a miserable man, but you do console me.---Take her o' God's name! I received her not half so willingly as I resign her to you again. 

                                         (taking Lady Sarah 's hand to give her to her brother, which she pulls away from him angrily, and going up to Lord Allcrest , gives him her hand as an act of her own.) 


Lady S. 
If my brother will indeed have the goodness! 



Boy. (skipping joyfully.) 
Sophy! sister Sophy! she is going away from us! is not that nice? 


Soph. 
Hush, George! 



Sea. (to Mrs. B. on perceiving her smile to herself.) 
Yes, madam, I make no doubt, but all this is very amusing to you---you are also come, no doubt, to bestow upon me your contribution of friendly sympathy. 


Mrs. B. 
Indeed, Sir Anthony, recollecting the happiness you have enjoyed, and the woman that shared it with you, you are entitled to no small portion of pity. 



Bea. (to Mrs. B. ) 
Fie upon it! fie upon it, Susan! can't you hold out your hand to him, and forgive him nobly, without tacking those little ungracious [175]  recollections to it? 
(to Sea. ) 
Indeed, my dear Seabright, you look upon us all with the suspicious eye of an unfortunate man, but we are truly come to you in kindness and Christian simplicity; and we bring you comfort. 


Sea. 
Yes, Beaumont, you come to me in simplicity. What comfort can you bring to me, ruined 

[Page 472 ] 

as I am? all my fair prospects blasted! all my honours disgraced! sunk even to obscurity and contempt! ---you are indeed come in great simplicity. 


Bea. 
What comfort can we bring to you? does grandeur and riches include the whole of human happiness, that you should now feel yourself inconsolable and hopeless? Cannot a quiet, modest retreat, independent of the bustle of the world, still be a situation of comfort? 


Sea. 
I know what you mean: contemptible, slothful obscurity. 


Bea. 
You mistake me, Sir Anthony; respectable and useful privacy. 


Sea. 
I understand you well enough: hopeless and without object---I abhor it! 


Bea. 
What, Seabright! can a man with a family to grow up around him, be hopeless and without object? Come here children, and speak for [200]  yourselves. 

                                         (he takes the children in his hands, and encouraging Sophia to come forward, they surround Seabright .) 



Soph. (after endeavouring in vain to speak, and kissing her father's hand tenderly.) 
O my dear father! in the loneliest cottage in England I could be happy with you. I would keep it so neat and comfortable, and do every thing for you so willingly; and the children would be so good, if you would but love us enough to be happy with us! 



Sea. (catching her in his arms.) 
Come to my heart, my admirable girl! thou truly hast found the way to it, and a stubborn unnatural heart it has been.--- 

[Page 473 ] 

But I will love you all---yes my children, I will love you enough to be happy with you. 
(pausing.) 
I hope I shall---I think I shall. 



Will. B. (eagerly.) 
Yes, you will! yes, you will! if there be one spark of a true man in your breast, you will love them to the last beat of your heart. 



Bea. (smiling affectionately on his son.) 
Get away, stripling! your warmth interrupts us. 


Sea. 
O no! let him speak!---say all of you what you please to me now: Say any thing that will break the current of my miserable thoughts; for we are at this moment indulging fancies as illusive as those that formerly misled me; even the cottage that we talk of, a peaceful home for my children, is no [225]  longer in my power. 



Bea. (going up to Morgan .) 
Now, my friend, this is the time for you to step forth, and make a subdued father and his innocent children happy: bestow your wealth liberally, and the blessings that will fall upon your grey head, shall well reward the toils and dangers that have earn'd it. 

                                         (Leading him up to Seabright .) 


Sea. 
Ha! what stranger is this? I observed him not before. 


Bea. 
Speak for yourself now, Mr. Morgan, I will do no more for you. 


Sea. 
Mr. Morgan, the uncle of my Caroline! 


Mor. 
Yes, Sir Anthony, and very much disposed, if you will give him leave, to---to love---to befriend 

[Page 474 ] 

---to be to you and yours---to be the uncle and friend of you all. 

                                         (speaking in a broken agitated voice.) 


Sea. 
O no! I am unworthy to receive any thing from you---from the uncle of my much injured wife; but these children, Mr. Morgan---I am not too proud to ask you to be a friend to them. 



Bea. (hastily to Sea. ) 
Poo, man! you have no real goodness in you, if you cannot perceive that he must and will be a friend to yourself also. Come, come! give him a hand of fellowship! 
(putting Seabright 's hand into Morgan 's.) 
Now, God [250]  will bless you both! 


Mor. 
If Sir Anthony will permit an old man, who has past thro' many buffetings of fortune, to draw his arm-chair by him in the evening of his life, and tell over the varied hardships he has met with, he will cheer its gloom, and make it pass more pleasantly. 

                                         ( Sea. presses Morgan 's hand to his breast, without speaking.) 



Mrs. B. (to Mor. ) 
Well said, and gracefully said, my good uncle! did not I tell you, you would go through your part well, if you would but trust to the dictates of your own good heart? 


Bea. 
O there is nobody, when he does what is noble and right, that does not find a way of doing it gracefully. 



Mrs. B. (to Sophia , who is going up timidly to Mor. ) 
Yes, that is right, my dear. Come, children, 
(leading the children up to him.) 
gather all about him. Yes, take hold of him; don't be afraid to 

[Page 475 ] 

touch him; it does young people good to pat the cheeks of a benevolent old man. 

                                         ( Mor. embraces them affectionately.) 



Wil. B. (joining the children in caressing Mor. )--- 
My dear Mr. Morgan, I love you with all my soul! ---And my sweet Sophy---my good Sophy, don't you love him too?---She is such a good girl, Mr. Morgan! 


Mor. 
So she is, William; and she must have a good husband by-and-bye to reward her. I dare [275]  say we shall find some body or other willing to have her. 

                                         (smiling archly upon William , who looks abashed; and letting go Sophy 's hand retires behind.) 



Sea. (to Mor. ) 
I have now voice enough, my generous friend, to say that I am sensible of your goodness: but there are feelings which depress me--- 


Mor. 
Say no more about it, my good Sir; I am happy, and I would have every body to rejoice with me. 



Lord A. (to Mor. leading forward Lady Sarah .) 
And every body does rejoice with you, my good Sir. Permit me to assure you, that tho', perhaps, somewhat injured with the ways of the world, I have not been an unfeeling spectator of what has pass'd; and I believe Lady Sarah also has not looked upon it with indifference. 
(turning to Sea. ) 
Now, Sir Anthony, I would, if possible, part friends with you; and I have a favour to request, which will, if 

[Page 476 ] 

it is granted, make me forget every unpleasant thing that has pass'd between us. 


Sea. 
Mention it, my Lord; I will not willingly refuse you. 


Lord A. 
My sister has just now told me, that she will leave you without regret, if you will let her have your youngest boy to live with her: I join my request to her's. 



Boy. (eagerly.) 
[300]  What, take Tony away from us! no but she shant tho'! 


Sea. 
I am much obliged to you, my Lord, and to Lady Sarah also; but I cannot find in my heart to divide my children. He shall, however, visit her frequently, if she will permit him; and if she will have the goodness to forget the hasty words of a passionate man, and still take an interest in any thing that belongs to him, he will be gratified by it. 


Soph. 
And I will visit Lady Sarah too, if she will have the goodness to permit me. 


Lady S. 
I thank you, my dear; it is, perhaps, more than I deserve. 
(to Mrs. B. ) 
And may I hope, madam, that you will forget whatever unpleasant things may have pass'd between us? 



Bea. (interrupting his wife as she is about to speak.) 
Now answer her pleasantly, my dear Susan! 
(Mrs. B. smiles pleasantly, and gives her hand to Lady Sarah .) 
Now every thing is right. O it is a pleasant thing to find that there is some good in every human being! 
(Enter a Servant, and whispers to Bea. ) 

Is he here? let him enter then. 


[Page 477 ] 



Sea. 
Who is it? I can see nobody now. 


Bea. 
Don't be alarmed: it is a friend of your's, who has offended you, and takes a very proper season to be forgiven. It is one who durst not, in your prosperity, shew you the extent of his attachment; [325]  but he is now come, for he has already open'd his mind to me upon hearing of your misfortunes, to put into your hands, for the benefit of your children, all the little money he has saved, since he first began to lay up one mite after another, and to call it his own property. 


Sea. 
Who can that be? I did not think there was a creature in the world that bore us so much affection. 

                                         (Enter Robert , who starts back upon seeing so many people.) 


Bea. 
Come in, my good Robert: 
(taking his hand and leading him forward.) 
thou need'st not be ashamed to shew thy face here: there is nobody here who will not receive thee graciously, not even Lady Sarah herself. 

                                         (The children and every body gather 'round Robert .) 



Sea. (coming forward with Bea. ) 
Ah, my dear Beaumont, what a charm there is in doing good! it can give dignity to the meanest condition. Had this unlucky scheme but succeeded, for if we could have but weather'd it a little while longer it must have succeeded, I should have been--- I think I should have been, munificent as a prince. 


[Page 478 ] 



Bea. 
Ah, no more of that, my dear friend! no more of that! such thoughts are dangerous, and the enemy is still at hand: chide the deceiver away from you, even when he makes his appearance in [350]  the fair form of virtue. 

Back matter 

FINIS.
